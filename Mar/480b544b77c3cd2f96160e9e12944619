Mercedes ace George Russell has insisted that the FIA could solve the 'porpoising' issue that affected the Silver Arrows and their rivals at last week's pre-season test in Barcelona by bringing active suspension back into the sport. The phenomenon, which has returned to Formula One after a 40-year absence, is a by-product of the ground effect that generates a significant percentage of downforce on the new 2022 cars. 'Porpoising' results in cars bouncing up and down at the end of long straights and was experienced by almost every team in Barcelona over the course of last week's three-day test.Mercedes were particularly affected by the problem and were forced to run temporary floor solutions on their W13 challenger in order to combat the flexing that resulted from it.Alfa Romeo sustained actual floor damage as a result of the issue, while Ferrari also struggled to deal with the bouncing on a handful of occasions during their test runs.Russell weighed in on the situation by insisting that it posed safety concerns when quizzed on the matter after Friday's session.He has since claimed that the FIA could find an immediate solution to the 'porpoising' issue by allowing teams to use active suspension.

And the cars would naturally be a hell of a lot faster if we had that."I’m sure all the teams are capable of that, so that could be one for the future, but let’s see in Bahrain. I’m sure the teams will come up with some smart ideas around this issue.“I think it’s clear if we had active suspension, the cars will be a hell of a lot faster for the same aerodynamic surfaces, because you’d be able to optimise the ride heights for every corner speed and optimise it down the straight for the least amount of drag. "So, it’s an easy way to make the cars go faster. And if you think of a safety aspect, then potentially [it’s an improvement]."I’m sure there’s more limitations, I’m not an engineer, but we wouldn’t have this issue down the straight, that’s for sure."Active suspension automatically controls the ride height to ensure that cars are kept in an optimal position at all times and was banned by the FIA in 1993 along with a number of other driver aids.It remains to be seen whether motorsport's governing body will explore its reintroduction over the coming months in order to combat the 'porpoising' issue that appears to be causing plenty of headaches this year.
