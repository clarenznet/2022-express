There are some big names in the Next James Bond odds, with Regé-Jean Page and Henry Cavill currently leading Ladbrokes’ latest on 3-1. And as Peaky Blinders returns to screens Tom Hardy isn’t far behind on 6-1, nor is Cillian Murphy on 12-1. But it’s their co-star who is currently the lead in ITV’s reboot of spy thriller The Ipcress File who has seen his odds slashed significantly. Back in January, Express.co.uk published an article on the most overlooked contenders with great odds to be the next 007. One of them was Joe Cole who is best known for Skins, Peaky Blinders and the movie Green Room with Sir Patrick Stewart. At the time, the 33-year-old had odds of 80-1 to be the next Bond. More recently they’ve been down to 50-1 with Ladbrokes, but now he’s suddenly at 33-1. No doubt it’s because he’s currently starring as Harry Palmer, the working class 007 alternative made famous by Michael Caine, in ITV’s The Ipcress File.

In fact, some of the production team on The Ipcress File had been involved in the early 007 movies. The original Harry Palmer star went on to make two films in the series in Funeral in Berlin and Billion Dollar Brain. He also reprised the role for two TV movies in the 1990s in Bullet to Beijing and Midnight in Saint Petersburg.
