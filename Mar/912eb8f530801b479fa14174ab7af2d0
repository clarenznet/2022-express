 ITV viewers have been desperately trying to solve the mysteries of Our House which has been airing every night this week. The four-part thriller series is set to come to a close on Thursday night, but some viewers have confessed they’re considering giving up after watching the penultimate episode.    Our House is ITV’s latest drama series and follows the eerie story of estranged couple Fi (played by Tuppence Middleton) and Bram (Martin Compston). While the couple are separated they still own their family home together, or so Fi thought. One day she returns home to find all of her belongings have vanished and a couple of strangers are moving into her house, claiming to be the new owners. The truth behind the mysterious house sale is slowly being revealed in a series of flashbacks, but it seems some viewers have had enough.

Taking to Twitter on Wednesday evening, several ITV viewers admitted they weren’t enjoying the “ridiculous” plot. “#ourhouse is so terrible I’ve no idea why I’m still watching it. Poor acting, awful script and abysmal directing. Expected better of @ITV," @beccahans commented. “#OurHouse is the worst drama I've watched in a long, long time. The story is ridiculous, the chance encounters, the ridiculously blue house, the whole thing is terrible,” @RichardStevens said. Some claimed they were giving up on the series and “switching off” despite there only being one episode left.   “This plot is beyond ridiculous now, and that voice annoying… switching off #OurHouse," @cornnishboy said. "Wow. #OurHouse is seriously bad. Script AWFUL. Stopped after six minutes. Utterly, utterly unbelievable and poorly acted,” @guywalters remarked. However, there were some viewers who appeared to be hooked by the twisting plotline and praised the drama.

Our House is based on the Sunday Times bestseller book of the same name by Louise Candlish. The novel came out in 2019 and claimed the prize for Book of the Year in the crime and thriller category at the British Book Awards the following year. Rupert Penry-Jones, Weruche Opia and Buket Komur also feature in the drama. The final instalment of Our House is set to air on Thursday night, although viewers have the option to stream it early on ITV Hub. Our House continues Thursday at 9pm on ITV.
