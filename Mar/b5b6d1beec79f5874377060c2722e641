Gogglebox's iconic duo Sophie and Pete Sandiford left viewers in tears last night after Sophie broke down in tears at the thought of having to leave her brother if he was needed to fight in a war. As the pair were watching the latest updates on the current war between Ukraine and Russia, Pete noted that he didn't know how he'd feel if he had to stay behind as many families have done. Getting emotional at the thought, Sophie broke down in tears just at the thought of having to leave Pete in a war. As the pair watched the news reports, Pete said: "I don't know how I would feel if I got held back, you know, to fight the war because what do you do? "You can't go 'No, I'm not going', but with the same token, do I really wanna be getting shot at and potentially killed?" Sophie sat quietly next to her brother and simply replied: "Yeah." Pete continued: "You know what is more valuable to me?" READ MORE: Danny Sebastian partner: Who is Bargain Hunt's Danny Sebastian with? Sophie began getting emotional and quipped: "Don't, it's choking me up even thinking about that because I would just stay with you." Pete laughed and said: "Nah, you wouldn't, I f*****g wouldn't let you, you little soft a**e, stop it, you k**bhead because you're going to make me cry, we're here, you f*****g idiot." "I know, but it's just scary," she replied, with tears rolling down her face. Viewers of the Channel 4 show were left just as emotional as the brother/sister duo and took to social media to express their compassion for them.
