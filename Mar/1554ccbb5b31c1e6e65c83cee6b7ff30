What is known is a number of factors can increase a person’s risk of developing the condition such as joint injury, older age, a family history of arthritis, and obesity. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include joint tenderness, increased pain and stiffness when the joint has not been moved for a while, and joints appearing slightly larger than usual. A grating or cracking sensation or sound in the joints, weakness, and muscle wasting are also symptoms of osteoarthritis. Signs of arthritis can also appear on the hand.

Furthermore, a person may develop cysts that appear on the backs of the fingers while the fingers themselves can become stiff, painful, and swollen. As well as cysts, bumps can develop too. These can be present on finger joints or at the base of the thumb.  There are a number of treatments for osteoarthritis including lifestyle measures, medication, and supportive therapies. Exercise, experts recommend, is one of the key treatments for patients with osteoarthritis as it builds muscle and helps the joints to strengthen. Furthermore, exercise can help a person to lose weight and therefore take weight off the joints so there’s less pressure exacted upon them. A GP or doctor may prescribe a tailored exercise regime that will best help treat their patient's arthritis. Meanwhile, a new study has looked into whether a particular action may increase or decrease the likelihood of someone developing arthritis. There has been debate over whether repeated cracking of the knuckles can cause arthritis. Dr Karl Kruszelnicki says he has the answer. In a video published on TikTok, Dr Kruszelnicki says the action won’t cause arthritis.
