The argument – which took place between journalist and commentator Owen Jones and a caller named Joan – stemmed from a remark made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which he compared the resistance to war in Ukraine to the vote for Brexit in the UK. The Prime Minister is facing calls to apologise, but the remarks ripped open old wounds in Britain, with some people reminded of the sense of betrayal in the years after the referendum. Speaking to Jeremy Vine, caller Joan said: “When Remain lost, nearly 500 MPs and that corrupt Speaker colluded with the 27 countries in the EU to delay implementation of the results. And ultimately to stop it." Owen Jones hit back: "Those MPs were democratically elected by the British people. "This is where your whole analogy falls down because the European Union is a voluntary association. "The USSR was a dictatorship which was based on domination by dictatorial and totalitarian means." He continued: "We voted to leave and we left. The reason there was a long delay wasn't because the EU stopped us from leaving, it was because there was a debate amongst democratically elected members of Parliament about what leaving should look like."

In a democracy, people have a right to wave placards." To which Joan hit back: "Exactly, and that is what Putin is doing. He is attacking a democracy of a sovereign country just like the EU."
