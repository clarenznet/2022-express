   Rita looked stunning as she smiled for the camera on the red carpet in Los Angeles. The actress wore a two-toned Greta Constantine gown that featured puffy, off-the-shoulder sleeves, and a floor-length skirt with a white front panel and a small train. The train, bodice and sleeves all shimmered in gold, while the white gloves Rita wore nicely tied in with the colour of the panelling on the front of the dress. The star accessorised the outfit with a delicate necklace of sparkling jewels, as well as some silver drop earrings with turquoise embellishments dangling from the ends.   Rita wore her silver hair short and opted for a glam make-up look, which included eyeliner, plenty of mascara, and some neutral-toned lip gloss. However, it wasn’t all smiles for the actress, who admitted she had trouble moving in the outfit. “I can't f***ing move in this thing. I can't raise my arms,” she said, while being interviewed by Access Hollywood's Scott Evans. “I know you can't use that word. Just bleep me!”. The Puerto Rican native portrayed newly created character Valentina in the Steven Spielberg-directed reboot of West Side Story. Rita famously won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing Anita in the original 1961 movie.
