Dame Prue said of second marriages: “It happens a lot. I have a lot of friends who fall in love late in life. Young people don’t understand. I think they find it embarrassing – like old people are not meant to do that. “The funny thing is they will find that when they get older they will feel exactly the same as when they were younger. “When I fell in love with John it was exactly like it was when I fell in love with my first husband, you panic when you look at your phone or think, ‘Shall I text?’ and all ofthat goes on. And why wouldn’t it?” Dame Prue – whose snazzy outfits have won many fans – also advised older people to be bolder themselves and resist the urge to blend into the background. She admitted: “I want to shake women sometimes. I get letters where they say, ‘I so admire you. I used to wear great colours like you when I was young but I am over 50 now and I can’t wear red’. “I say, ‘Why not?’ That is when you need it. When you are 17 you can look invisible but women think it is their duty to be invisible after they are 50 or 60 – and I think that is nonsense. “I have a necklace range and it is because women spend a fortune on shoes and handbags and where do they sit? Under the table. Your glasses and necklaces are on your face.” Speaking on the Jonathan Van Ness podcast, Dame Prue revealed: “I have about 40 pairs of glasses and start the day thinking what will the glasses be today or the necklace and work around that.”
