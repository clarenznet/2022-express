Sammie-Jo Hailford, 27, painted on her eyebrows around one year ago in a bid to "stand out" but has since been trolled online and laughed at on the street. The mum of two says strangers have even reported her to social services. But defiant Sammie-Jo, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, stressed she's not bothered about the accusations as she's "got nothing to hide". Speaking to Daily Star, the full-time mum said: "People have said I shouldn’t be a mum and they are going to ring social services because of my eyebrows. It gets really extreme on the internet. "They can call social services because I have nothing to hide. "My eyebrows don’t determine whether I’m a good mother or not."  Sammie-Jo, who has more than 75,000 followers on TikTok, started using liquid liner to make her brows bigger in 2021. She says men, including strangers, have found the adjustment attractive. "I have had quite a few men in my inbox telling me I’m beautiful and saying they would date me. They always mention the eyebrows first, so maybe there is a fetish there," Sammie-Jo added. "I’m not a massive fan of beauty standards today. "I feel like people are socially conditioned to only be beautiful if they are part of these standards and I just don’t agree with it and I don’t like it. "It would be cool if they were Britain’s biggest eyebrows. “I just like to make a statement and the brows do that for me. They started off normal size and they just got bigger over time and I just like to look different." Some people have taunted Sammie-Jo about the bizarre fashion statement though, including young women on the street. “Younger girls will laugh at me in the street, I’ve had that a couple of times but they do it between themselves," the mother continued. "The worst comments are online. I get horrible comments about my makeup and they also take the mick out of my teeth too. "Trolling doesn’t affect me now. I’m trying to raise awareness to the fact that people can be different."
