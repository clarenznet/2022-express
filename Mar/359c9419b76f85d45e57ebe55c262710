A major rescue operation is unfolding as attempts are made to save the crew members. So far, 29 members of the 30-man crew have been saved. An official from Iran's Bushehr Province told Iran's official IRNA news outlet: "Twenty-nine crew members have so far been saved, and rescue operations are continuing to find another team member." The boat was carrying cars when it capsized off the coast of Iran in the Persian Gulf on Thursday, authorities have said. Dubai-based Salem Al Makrani Cargo Company has confirmed it was their vessel, the Al Salmy 6. The company said the ship sank due to bad weather, when high winds and choppy seas caused the vessel to capsize. Iranian authorities sent two vessels to rescue the 30 crew members soon after the accident was reported. Meteorologists reported wind speeds of 70 kilometres per hour at the scene. The search and rescue operations have been impacted by the challenging weather conditions, however the teams are continuing their efforts to find the missing crew member. The crew consisted of nationals from Sudan, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. Severe weather battered the region on Wednesday, bringing powerful wind gusts of over 40mph and high waves to Iran's Bushehr province. The conditions were expected to last until the weekend, with the Iran Meteorological Organisation issuing a "red alert" warning that strong winds would cause disruption to maritime activities and potentially damage offshore facilities.
