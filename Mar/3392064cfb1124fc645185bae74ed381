If you want to make some serious money playing video games, then there's one title that stands head and shoulders above the rest. A PC game called DOTA 2 has made more millionaires than any other competitive video game. That's according to a recent report put together by betting site OLBG, which lists the top 500 earners in the world of eSports. eSports is the commonly used term for competitive video game playing, which has seen a huge increase in popularity. DOTA 2 - which is a free game that can be downloaded from Steam - dominates the top 50. Danish gamer Johan Sundstein (aka N0tail) tops the list with earnings of £5,297,759 on DOTA 2. Sundstein is followed by Jesse Vainikka, Anathan Pham, Sébastien Debs and Topias Taavitsainen, all of whom have made more than £4 million on DOTA 2.

Kyle Giersdorf (aka Bugha) made more than £3 million playing Fortnite, while Peter Rasmussen made almost £2 million on Counter Strike Global Offensive. Call of Duty fan Ian Porter (C6) is the highest listed COD player, taking home £1.3 m playing Modern Warfare.
