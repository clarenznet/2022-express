There’s a lot to prepare when you send your child to a new school, and getting the right uniform is very important. Each school decides its own uniform policy, and your child could be disciplined if they are not wearing the right uniform. They can even be suspended or expelled if they consistently flout the uniform rules. However some schools have extensive lists of what you need to buy.  This can include trousers, shorts or a skirt, as well as shoes, a shirt and possibly a blazer. It may also include a PE skirt, such as shorts, a polo shirt and trainers. If you are struggling to pay for the uniform, talk to the Headteacher of your child’s school as you may be able to get help with the cost. Many schools offer grants, sell nearly-new uniforms or operate discount schemes. You should check if your local council provides help with the cost of school uniform and PE kit. To do this, type your postcode into this Government website checker and it will tell you who your local council is.

If your council does not offer help, ask your child’s school directly or contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau as they may also be aware of some local funding that could help towards school uniform costs.
