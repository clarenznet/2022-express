The Italian-American Mafia and other real-life gangsters have been the subject of so many great mob movies. And now Showcase Cinemas have polled 2000 Brits this month to discover the nation’s favourites as The Godfather trilogy returns to the big screen for the first film’s 50th anniversary. It should come as little surprise that the 1972 original, which often tops the greatest films of all time polls, came in at No 1 with 22 per cent of the vote. Just behind on 20 per cent was Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, closely followed by Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas. Almost half of Brits believe The Godfather to be one of the best film franchises of all time, with less than 1 in 10 disagreeing. As for the nation’s favourite gangster movie star, Robert De Niro came out on top with 25 per cent of the vote for his roles in the likes of Goodfellas, Casino and The Godfather Part II. Just behind in second place was The Godfather trilogy and Scarface star Pacino, who co-starred in Scorsese’s The Irishman with De Niro. The Godfather was voted Pacino’s best gangster movie with 26 per cent of the vote and Goodfellas was Brits’ favourite De Niro mob film on 23 per cent. As for the most iconic line in movie film history, the UK chose The Godfather Part II’s “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” Surprisingly the best gangster movie scene turned out to be John Travolta and Uma Thurman dancing in Pulp Fiction.
