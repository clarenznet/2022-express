Although take up of state benefits has increased, more work still needs to be done. Latest figures show that there are still 850,000 pensioners missing out on thousands of pounds per year in Pension Credit from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Pension Credit is a benefit for retirees to help them with living costs if they are over state pension age and on a low income. Nearly one million (850,000) older people receive the state pension yet don’t claim Pension Credit from the DWP. To qualify for Pension Credit someone needs to be earning less than £177.10 per week. They could find themselves earning an extra £3,120 over the course of a year.

Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said benefit take up is improving but too many pensioners are still missing out. She said: “Pension Credit take-up continues to inch up but there are still up to 850,000 pensioner households missing out on this vital benefit. “Pension Credit boosts the income of the poorest pensioners and acts as a valuable gateway to other benefits such as help with heating bills and NHS treatment." Meanwhile, people do not have to pay for a TV licence if they only watch Netflix and YouTube meaning they could also save £159 per year. As long as they don’t watch live programmes or record TV to watch later, they don’t need to fork out the cash. It also covers anyone living in the same household meaning they don’t need a TV licence either. As well as a free TV licence, it could also mean that pensioners receive help towards the cost of energy bills, council tax and free prescriptions.  What is happening where you live?
