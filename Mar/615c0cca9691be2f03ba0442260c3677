Elden Ring Dragon Communion altars could be one of the first few things you stumble upon in the game's huge open-world. However, if you haven't acquired a Dragon Heart yet you may be a bit confused as to how exactly this all works. The first Dragon Communion altar is located near to where you end up after completing the Elden Ring tutorial. The Church of Dragon Communion is located on an island that's southwest from Limgrave. You will have to head through the Coastal Cave dungeon and beat the Demi-Human Chiefs boss there to access it. When you defeat bosses in Elden Ring you will be rewarded with Dragon Hearts, which can then be used at Dragon Communion altars. You can exchange Dragon Hearts for unique spells which will help you along in your adventure. At the Church of Dragon Communion you will be able to exchange Dragon Hearts for one of three Incantations - the Dragonfire, Dragonclaw or Dragonmaw. If you're wondering exactly where the location is for the Church of Dragon Communion then checkout the Elden Ring map in this article.  Alternatively, there is another Dragon Communion altar location that you can head to in Elden Ring. As PC Gamer explained in a post online, you can find the Cathedral of Dragon Communinion in Caelid, in the southwest area of the region. You will find this altar south of the main road when it moves east. If you're wondering what you can get at this location then here is a list of the spells available... - Dragonclaw - Dragonfire - Dragonmaw  - Glintstone Breath - Rotten Breath - Dragonice - Agheel's Flame - Smarag's Glintstone Breath - Ekzykes's Decay
