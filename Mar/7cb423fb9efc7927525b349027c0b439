It seems his team will concentrate on getting the “Toxic” singer as the first guest on his show on the new channel TalkTV. An insider said: “She’s one of the biggest names in showbiz with a fascinating story to tell. Piers would love to sit down with Britney – as would his former employees ITV – so it would be a major coup for him. And he wants to start with a bang.” Piers, 56, was vocal in his support for the troubled singer who was under her father’s control for 13 years because of a court-imposed conservatorship. The former GMB host said: “It was stunning to hear the brutal reality from Britney’s own mouth, in her own powerful, eloquent, often rapid-fire words. “It was like she couldn’t wait to finally have her say, and who could blame her for the obvious frustration and anger? "The last time she appeared in front of Judge Penny, in 2019, Britney’s testimony was sealed. “This time, it was made public so there could be no doubt or self-interested "spin" about what she was asserting.” Piers jumped to support JK Rowling when she was labelled a Terf by trans rights activists calling the Twitter campaign against her “horrendous”.
