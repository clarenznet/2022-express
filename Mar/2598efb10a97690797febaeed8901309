Emergency services rushed to Queen's Dock at Port of Liverpool at around 11pm last night after reports of a car in the water. Officers found a woman had driven her Audi through a metal barrier. The driver had managed to free herself from the vehicle while it was still floating and was checked over by paramedics. Miraculously, the woman avoided serious injuries. But the car is now completely submerged under the water and officers have cordoned off the section of fence broken by the vehicle. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, the North West Ambulance Service, and the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) were also called to the scene, reports Liverpool Echo today. Video taken at the scene, which is on the River Mersey adjacent to Liverpool city centre, shows an emergency vehicle operating blue flashing lights. Until it became clear the woman didn't have severe injuries, people on social media had been sharing concerned messages. "Hope she is safe and well," one message on Facebook read. "I do wish her the best recovery," another comment reads.
