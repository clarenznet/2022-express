Caitlin Rich, 25, is working with the Cystic Fibrosis Trust after noting that life in lockdown was similar to the precautions she has to take in her everyday life. Caitlyn, of Hadfield, Derbyshire, said: "The idea came from a conversation with my nurse who called me before a hospital visit to check I didn't have Covid-19. "After the first question of 'do you have a persistent cough?' there was a pause. I've known this nurse for nearly a decade and have had a cough the whole time due to my cystic fibrosis. "I said, 'Of course! What do you think I'm coming in for?' "We laughed, but unfortunately most people don't find my cough as amusing. "I quickly realised that we could draw on many more parallels between living in the pandemic and living with cystic fibrosis - social distancing from others with the condition, fear of catching a dangerous infection, restrictions on socialising and travelling. "It has always been difficult to get people to understand what it is like to live with cystic fibrosis but this campaign might help by relating it to our universal experience of the pandemic."
