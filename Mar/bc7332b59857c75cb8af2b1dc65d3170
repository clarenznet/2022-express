Speaking at the Conservative Party’s spring conference in Blackpool last weekend, Boris Johnson said that Brexit showed British people loved freedom in the same way as Ukrainians do in their fight against Russia's invasion. His comments were branded tasteless and offensive by MPs from within his own party and beyond, but the Prime Minister has stood by them and declined to apologise. He said: “I can give you a couple of famous recent examples. “When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large, large numbers, I don't believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. “It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.” The backlash from the comment was instant and fierce, from all sides of the political spectrum. Conservative peer Lord Barwell said voting in a referendum was not "in any way comparable with risking your life" in a war. READ MORE: POLL: Do YOU think MPs colluded with Remainers to stop Brexit?  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Mr Johnson's comments were "crass and distasteful". But defending the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told Times Radio: “People will make up their own minds. “But I can tell you categorically, the Prime Minister does not think that the situation in Ukraine and Brexit are directly comparable. “Of course they’re not, no one would say that they are. He was making some general comments about freedom in different guises.” So what do YOU think? Was a vote for Brexit a vote for freedom?
