The huge tanker named “Ariel” is carrying 400,000 barrels of crude oil and left the Russian port of Primorsk on January 29. However, marine tracking data has shown the super-tanker about-turn halfway into the Atlantic Ocean, and head for safety in a Welsh port. The change of itinerary occurred on February 14 according to Tankertrackers.com. The British Government yesterday ordered its ports to refuse any vessels that are Russian-flagged or believed to be registered, owned or controlled by any person connected with Russia as it ratcheted up the pressure on Moscow.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a letter to all UK ports further detailing sanctions against Russian shipping were being drawn up following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Writing on Twitter, Mr Shapps said: “The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia's economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.”The Minister added: “We will seek to support UK ports in identifying Russian ships within the scope of the above, and will communicate directly with relevant ports when we identify ships bound for UK ports who fall within the scope of the above.” A US official speaking to The Independent stated the oil tanker is believed to have changed course through fear of falling under sanction had it made its way to the US.Valero, which has its global headquarters in San Antonio, Texas, and the owner of the Pembroke Oil Refinery, did not respond to a request for comment by The Independent ahead of publication.The tanker spent several days off the UK coast before finally docking in the Welsh port of Milford Haven, which is used by Valero.Asked about another Russian vessel due to arrive in Orkney to collect oil later this week, a British government spokesperson said:“I think we are looking into what we can do about either Russian ships or ships with links to Russia using UK ports."

National Grid said it was still unsure whether LNG terminals, such as the one it operates on the Isle of Grain, were included in the order from Mr Shapps.A spokesman said: “We are supportive of government action to order UK ports to block all Russian-linked ships, and are seeking to understand if this includes LNG terminals and Russian-linked cargo.“The decision as to whether the UK accepts Russian LNG sits with [the business department] and our customers – we have a legal, contractual obligation to receive our customers’ vessels into our terminal, and do not have any control over the origin of the LNG they contain.”
