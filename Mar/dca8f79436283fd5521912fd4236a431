More than 700 workers were wrongly accused of financial crimes over 14 years due to the faulty Horizon IT system. A group of 555 won a civil case in the High Court but most of their settlements were swallowed up by legal fees.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: "The Horizon IT dispute has had a devastating impact on postmasters and their families, with many losing livelihoods or being wrongly convicted for crimes they didn't commit. "Without the efforts of these postmasters, this terrible injustice may have never been uncovered so it is only right they are compensated fully and fairly." The 2019 legal ruling paved the way for millions of pounds in future payouts and led to the Court of Appeal quashing wrongful criminal convictions. But a "no win, no fee" agreement meant subpostmasters got only a fraction of the £43million they were awarded, working out to around £20,000 each.  They were also ineligible for a compensation scheme set up by the Post Office. The Treasury said its payout would ensure the 555 would get the same compensation as those given cash from their former employer. The Government said it could now go ahead with the compensation scheme because Therium, which funded the group's legal claim, agreed to waive its rights to any claim on the cash.
