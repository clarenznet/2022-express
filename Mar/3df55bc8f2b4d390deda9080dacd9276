Manchester United's board are reportedly considering offloading Ralf Rangnick before the end of the season as they have supposedly conceded it was a 'mistake' to hire the German coach. The Red Devils were in disarray at the start of the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with pressure mounting on the club's board to bring in a new manager.

It is reported that the United board accept they made a 'mistake' on hiring Rangnick as Solskjaer's replacement. Erik ten Hag is touted as the favourite to replace Rangnick, but no final decision has been made as of yet. Reports emerged this month that Ten Hag had been taking English lessons in preparation for taking the job at Old Trafford. But the Ajax boss has distanced himself from those reports, insisting they speak English at the Dutch club on a regular basis. "No, that's not true!" he told BT Sport, in perfect English.
