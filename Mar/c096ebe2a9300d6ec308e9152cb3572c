William and an emotional looking Kate went to the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in Holland Park, west London, to meet volunteers sending two lorry loads of aid each day to their fellow countrymen fighting a Russian invasion and a humanitarian catastrophe. The second in line to the throne told them Britain and the rest of Europe were united behind them and spoke of the shock of seeing war on European soil. William, 39, said Britons were much more used to seeing conflict in Africa and Asia. “It’s very alien to see this in Europe. We are all behind you,” he said. But he added that he, like many, wanted to do more to help. “We feel so useless,” he said. He and Kate, 40, wore Ukrainian yellow and blue solidarity badges and took trays of chocolate brownies and granola bars, homemade at Kensington Palace, for the volunteers. They offered assistance from their charitable foundation for children and young people suffering mental health problems and trauma from the war and said their own children, or at least Tudor older two, Prince George, eight, and Princess Charlotte, six, had been affected by the unfolding tragedy in Eastern Europe. “Ours have been coming home asking all about it,” William said. “They are obviously talking about it with their friends at school.” He suggested he had found it difficult discussing some of it with his children, adding he had to “choose my words carefully to explain what is going on”.
