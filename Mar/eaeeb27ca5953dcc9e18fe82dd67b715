The electronic ankle tags monitor sweat levels every 30 minutes and alert probation services if the wearer has been drinking. They can distinguish between drinks and other types of alcohol, such as hand sanitiser or perfume. Courts now have the power to hand out “alcohol abstinence orders” to offenders who commit crimes while drunk. They can require the offender to abstain from alcohol for up to four months, with the tags monitoring compliance. Those who breach their order risk further sanctions. Two in five violent crimes are committed by a person when drunk. The social and economic cost of drink-related harm is estimated at £21.5billion a year. Sobriety tags were introduced in Wales in October 2020 and rolled out across England from the end of March last year. Policing and Crime Minister Kit Malthouse, in response to a parliamentary question, rev-ealed that 2,383 alcohol monitoring orders and licence conditions were imposed bet-ween April 1 and Dec- ember 17 last year in Eng-land and Wales. He said: “The compliance rate with these orders was 97.4 percent. The majority were for community sentences, but the figure includes a small number of alcohol monitoring on licence cases for prison leavers.” He said this began last November for offenders being supervised in Wales and will be rolled out to England this summer. He added: “Under the £183million plan to expand the use of electronic monitoring, alcohol tags will have been used on more than 12,000 prison leavers by 2024 to 2025.” The tags can only be used with offenders over the age of 18, who are not dependent on alcohol or have certain medical conditions.
