In a time of crisis, when the war in Ukraine goes on causing a humanitarian catastrophe, and the cost of living is soaring across Europe, after a long, cold winter in the UK, many would think that there would be nothing that could spoil a few days of vacations in the Canary Islands. However, the Englishman has found plenty of reasons to complain, which he has posted on Twitter for the hundreds of his followers. The nightmare for the tourist, who goes by the name Sir Pier Dole on Twitter, began even before he set foot on the Spanish archipelago. While filling his Passenger Locator Form, he said he replied with ‘Other’ when asked about the date he had received the Covid vaccine. However, he was given a QR code required to fly. He commented: “What’s the point?” He then flew to Tenerife from Birmingham airport, where the smoking area was closed. He complained: “Why did I go airside so soon?” Later, referring to Birmingham airport, he asked:”Why don’t you welcome smokers any more?“ And joked: “In future I shall switch to Manchester.” After he arrived in Tenerife, the man posted a Tweet to complain about the strict regulations. He said: “Face masks of course but if you walk down the road smoking you can get a €1000 fine. “You have to stop and smoke standing. "I’d love to know the science.” The man was concerned about his safety due to the bad condition of the ferry that took him from Tenerife to La Gomera. He posted a photo of the ferry, saying: “Boarded the ferry from Tenerife to La Gomera. “This rusty old rattle bucket surely won’t make it.” According to the tourist, the ferry was really loud while embarking and needed repairments. The man also posted a short video of a part of the ferry which seemed to be detached. He commented: “Falling apart but you must wear a mask to keep you safe.“
