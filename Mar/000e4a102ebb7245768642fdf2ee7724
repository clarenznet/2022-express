On Thursday, British shipping company P&O Ferries caused widespread shock when the firm sacked 800 employees over Zoom to replace them with “cheaper agency workers”. P&O said it took the "difficult decision" as a "last resort" to save the business. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) called the move one of the "most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations". Speaking on GB News, Nigel Farage said: "How are we going to protect British workers? Is this just the modern, globalised world that we live in? "This is one of the most cynical sackings I have ever seen in my life.   "People who voted Brexit voted for better than this. The Government had better have a very very rapid think about how it responds. It's a disgrace.” P&O Ferries said in a statement on Friday: "We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies." Labour has urged the Government to publish the legal advice it received on whether P&O broke the law when it sacked the workers on Thursday. How do you think the Government should respond to P&O Ferries' drastic measures to make 800 employees immediately redundant?
