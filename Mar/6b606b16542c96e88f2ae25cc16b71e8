Leonid Volkov, ex-chief of staff to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said the despot was "crazy enough" to use nuclear weapons to achieve his aims. He added: "We can unfortunately expect everything from the Russian president." Mr Navalny, who stood against Putin and was poisoned with Novichok, is in jail on fraud charges. Mr Volkov said a huge cost must be paid to stop the invasion of Ukraine: "There are all the sanctions, of course they also create a burden on the European economy. "But this cost has to be paid because otherwise Putin will just destroy the world. He is clearly not winning the war. He might think about other solutions, more powerful weapons. This is not our war, not in our name."
