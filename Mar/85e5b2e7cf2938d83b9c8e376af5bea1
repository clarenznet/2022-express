Putin has invaded Ukraine and waged a bloody war on the country for the past two weeks. To show solidarity, the Duke of Cambridge visited the Ukrainian Cultural Centre in London. But comments he made have been met with backlash. He said: "Britons were more used to seeing conflict in Africa and Asia. It's very alien to see this in Europe. We are all behind you." Meghan Markle fans have hit out at the Duke. Co-author of royal book, Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family, and staunch Sussex supporter Omid Scobie said he was "unsurprised" to see the backlash against Prince William's "ignorant remark." One member of the Sussex Squad, MarkleDuchess, wrote on Twitter: "Prince William’s own mother visited Bosnia in 1997, shortly before her death. Are you telling me he wasn’t aware of the war and genocide that was raging on at that time?" Another prominent supporter of Meghan, Dr Shola, wrote: "Prince William’s comments are deeply offensive. He must apologise." The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association also condemned comments like this. They said last week: "It dehumanises and renders their experience with war as somehow normal and expected... civilian casualties and displacement in other countries are equally as abhorrent as they are in Ukraine.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
