We instinctively grasp the desperation of mothers in Ukraine fearing for their children's survival, sacrificing everything to get their babies to safety.Their courage is humbling but we expect it of them because they're mothers. Here, well away from war, a report from Bupa tells us what we already know: mums are hugely stressed by social media expectations of "super-mum". They can't (who can?) live up to the impossible internet image of the perfect mother with a beautiful home and happy family.What they see as their failure to be flawless is making them ill - depressed and hopeless. Meanwhile in America, the biggest blockbuster novel of the year is The Push, by new Canadian author Ashley Audrain. We've chosen it for ourWHSmith book club because it delves deep into every new mother's insecurities.The narrator, Blythe, has a daughter she cannot love. She blames herself because, she says, "the women in our family are different". Her mother and grandmother were bad mothers, icy and neglectful, and Blythe fears she's inherited that gene. But is it her fault, or is Violet a "bad seed"? She's cold and vicious to her mother but fawns over her doting father, who thinks his daughter's perfect and his wife is, yes, a bad mother. Sadly, their marriage disintegrates after Blythe has another child, Sam, whom she loves unconditionally, but who is tragically killed as a toddler.Was it an accident or, as Blythe suspects, deliberately caused by Violet?

Do we expect the impossible from mothers? I was going to end with Philip Larkin's famous lines on parenthood: "They **** you up, your mum and dad," but I won't. Because most mums are heroines who'd do anything for their child, as we're witnessing right now in poor, tragic Ukraine.
