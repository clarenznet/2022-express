Andy Murray faces a tall order to progress to the third round of the Miami Open after setting up a mouthwatering tie against Daniil Medvedev. But Andy Roddick believes the British tennis superstar has a "good chance" of causing an upset so long as he raises his first-serve percentage. Murray has been one of the busiest players on the ATP Tour this season with the Miami Open being his eighth event of 2022. He's so far failed to progress past the second round in any competition so far and faces a tough task in changing that this weekend. Murray's win over Federico Delbonis has set up a fascinating battle with Medvedev, who has a chance of returning to the world No 1 spot in Miami. The three-time Grand Slam champion impressed against Delbonis, winning the second set 6-1. But he also had a strong record throughout the match, averaging 77 per cent with his first serve. First-serve percentage has been an issue for Murray this year as he's averaged just 58.36 per cent over 16 matches in 2022.

The Russian ranks even higher on first-serve points won in 11th with an average of 78.02% while Murray is down in 37th with 73.15 per cent of points won on his first serve. And Roddick believes the 34-year-old will need to focus on his first serve in order to stand a chance of causing an upset against Medvedev. "First serve percentage has to be above 65 per cent for him to have a good chance against Daniil," Roddick said on Tennis Channel. DON'T MISS  Murray will likely also need to improve his ability to convert break-point opportunities. Of the 28 players on the ATP Tour to have over 100 break-point opportunities in 2022, only Taylor Fritz has a slightly worse conversion rate than Murray. The American has converted 55 of 177 break points at a rate of 31.07 per cent. Murray's is only slightly better having taken 37 of 199 opportunities at a rate of 31.09 per cent. The former British No 1 is aiming to climb up the rankings this year to help his chances of going deeper in tournaments. He moved back into the top 100 for the first time since 2018 last month and has slowly been improving his position since.
