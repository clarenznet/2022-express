Her younger sister Princess Eugenie wore a more floral and decorative dress with an accompanying black shawl. Both the Princesses were wearing headbands as they could be seen walking in, along with Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.   Beatrice is wearing her Nonoo Lyons 'Beatrice' coat, along with her Kooples dress. The coat is a bell sleeve coat with pleated shoulder detail that she last wore in 2010. Beatrice's above-knee frock from The Kooples featured sheer lace detailing and gold feather motifs all over it. She has previously been pictured wearing it during other appearances in London, including a date with Edoardo back in 2019. She has paired this with a pair of Gianvito Rossi 'Lorraine' pumps and her Justine Bradley-Hill Millinery 'Mildred' hat.
