Brexiteer and Tory MP Steve Barker responded to the changes by saying Boris Johnson has broken his leadership promises and calling on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to trigger Article 16. He said: "We must do what is necessary to bring Northern Ireland back into the UK single market. "We must trigger Article 16 immediately before the Stormont election. The Prime Minister must realise that for a great number of conservative MPs, Brexit isn't done until the Northern Ireland protocol is fixed. Ms Truss has said that now is not the time to trigger Article 16 due to the conflict in Ukraine.
