The disclosure was described as "astonishing" with the Care Quality Commission accused of "sitting on the sidelines" while people have endured two years of being banned from seeing dying relatives. Just 4,668 of 14,994 residential social care locations have been asked the mandatory question over access: "Is the service facilitating visits to people living at the home in accordance with current guidance?" Helen Wildbore, from the Relatives and Residents Association, said: "The admission from CQC of how little action they have taken to protect people's rights is astonishing. "Given the CQC exists to safeguard people in receipt of care and promote improvement of services their lack of action, voice and leadership has not only left people at risk, it has damaged any remaining trust in their authority." The CQC said the question was introduced in March last year when guidance then allowed visitors. But this was when an essential care-giver role was introduced and visiting had been permitted before then. The pandemic erupted a year earlier. The capacity tracker, data from which is used by the Department of Health and Social Care to see how many homes are open, is voluntary. Campaign group Rights for Residents said: "When we have surveyed families and residents affected by harsh visiting policies, we have consistently found breaches of guidance to be far more widespread than those reported in figures presented by the CQC and DHSC. "Many care homes clearly do not understand the guidance or interpret it to suit their preference. Many still limit the numbers and duration of visits." Kate Terroni, from the CQC, said: "Guidance is now to ensure visiting is unrestricted. We will follow up where we are made aware this may not be happening."
