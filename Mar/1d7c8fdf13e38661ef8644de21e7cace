The cast of All Creatures Great And Small are back in the Yorkshire Dales village of Arncliffe to film the third series. And they gathered yesterday to shoot the eagerly anticipated wedding of the much-loved vet and farmer's daughter Helen Alderson - with Mrs Pumphrey's pampered Pekingese Tricki Woo appearing to be the guest of honour. James, played by Nicholas Ralph, proposed to Helen in the second series of Channel 5's hit reboot of the show that was a favourite from 1978 to 1990. Millions of new viewers had hoped to see the couple marry during the Christmas special. When they didn't, fans feared the outbreak of the Second World War might leave the ceremony up in the air. But it looks like there is a happy ending after all, with Rachel Shenton, who plays Helen, beaming as she is filmed leaving the church with her new on-screen husband. Guests attending the nuptials include housekeeper Mrs Hall (Anna Madeley), Siegfried Farnon (Samuel West) and his brother Tristan (Callum Woodhouse). The third series is expected to air in the autumn.
