New research has found that just 16 percent of over-55s are happy for their sons and daughters to take care of them in old age. But there is a “supply and demand chasm” between the number of pensioners who want to live independently and suitable homes available. Not enough are being built, warns a report by retirement housing group Anchor, entitled “Fragmented UK”. It says there will be a shortfall of 400,000 specialist homes by 2035. Anchor chief executive Jane Ashcroft said: “Our research shows how important independence and community are to older people. Specialist housing gives people access to both and we’ve seen demand rising significantly in the past few years. “The Government’s commitment to housing for older people is an important step. But as our population ages, supply will continue to struggle to meet demand. “It’s imperative barriers to development are addressed, so everyone has the opportunity to live where and how they want.” There were four key areas – cited by 2,000 older people surveyed – as ­crucial in maintaining independence. Making their own decisions was considered very important, as was having control over their financial affairs and living in their own home. Meanwhile, 36 percent of younger people are now considering moving closer to their extended family – citing Covid as the primary reason.
