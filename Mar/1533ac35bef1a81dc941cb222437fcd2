Chelsea FC have been left in chaos after the news broke on Thursday morning that their Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government. The 55-year-old had recently listed the club for sale amid worries that this very situation could occur due to his links with Vladimir Putin.

In the short-term it means that, for now, Chelsea are unable to sell tickets, and only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend upcoming games.
