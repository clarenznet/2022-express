UB40 had a very difficult year in 2021. Not only did frontman Duncan Campbell retire in June following a stroke, but the band’s saxophonist Brian Travers died in August after battling cancer. Then, in November, former vocalist and founding member Astro died too after a short illness. Having pushed on through their troubles, the band are back with a bang as they announce their 2022 Bigga Baggariddim UK and Ireland tour. To book tickets click here. The iconic reggae band, formed in 1978, are set to hit the road across the country, hot on the heels of their secret surprise live show at the Commonwealth Games later this year. The 18-date tour will take place from May 4-June 1, with new dates announced today for December. Following Campbell’s retirement last summer, the tour will also see the touring debut of UB40’s new singer Matt Doyle. The musician had previously supported the group with his fellow Birmingham band Kioko. Last summer, Campbell’s older brother Robin, UB40 guitarist and vocalist, said of Doyle: “He's a talented young man with a voice and singing style that will prove to be a good fit and a great asset to the band.” The Biggs Baggariddim Tour “promises to be a true UB40 fest - a celebration of the band’s timeless classics and fan favourites, alongside their latest material. Audiences will be treated to a set list packed with incredible hits, such as Food for Thought, Kingston Town, (I Can't Help) Falling in Love With You and Red, Red Wine, amongst many others.” Robin Campbell said of the tour: “We’re so excited to finally be going back on the road and feel the vibe and love of a live crowd, and for all the UB40 fans to meet Matt as well. They can expect a phenomenal show. We’ll be sure to bring the party.” UB40 noted: “The shows will additionally see the live debut of new track Champion, written for the new multi-artist album On Record as part of the Birmingham 2022 Festival ahead of the arrival of the Commonwealth Games later this year.” Here’s the full list of UK and Ireland dates for The Bigga Baggariddim Tour: DON'T MISSUB40's still benefitting from love of reggae [UB40]Ali Campbell admits he'll never unite with UB40: 'I betrayed by them' [ALI CAMPBELL]Duncan Campbell: UB40 singer in hospital after stroke [DUNCAN CAMPBELL] The Bigga Baggariddim Tour 2022 May 4: Brighton, The Brighton CentreMay 7: Blackpool, Empress BallroomMay 8: Manchester, O2 ApolloMay 10: Plymouth, PavilionsMay 11: Cardiff, Motorpoint ArenaMay 13: Portsmouth, GuildhallMay 14: Norwich, UEAMay 15: Stoke, Victoria HallMay 17: Liverpool, Eventim OlympiaMay 18: Nottingham, Rock CityMay 20: Northampton, Royal and Derngate HallMay 21: Cheltenham, The CentaurMay 23: Hull, Bonus ArenaMay 25: Edinburgh, Usher HallMay 26: Glasgow, BarrowlandsMay 27: Aberdeen, Music HallMay 29: Stockton, GlobeMay 31: Bournemouth, O2 AcademyDec 9: Belfast, Ulster HallDec 10: Castlebar, The Royal Theatre and Event CentreDec 18: Birmingham, Utilita ArenaDec 20: Leeds, First Direct ArenaDec 21: London, OVO Arena Wembley To book tickets click here.
