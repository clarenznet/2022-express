Some 670 registered in England and Wales during the week to March 4 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. This was down 13 percent on the previous seven days and just under half the number at the peak of the Omicron wave, according to the Office for National Statistics.  Latest data suggests Covid deaths are still on a downward trend, following a rise in December and early January. But it is too soon to see any impact in the figures following a recent rise in coronavirus infections. Health chiefs are keeping a close eye following an uptick in hospitalisations. There were 10,877 patients on wards in England yesterday, up 28 percent from 8,486 a fortnight earlier. Chris Hopson, NHS Providers chief executive, said while the overall number in hospital remains relatively low, "rising admissions can have knock on effects for patient care".
