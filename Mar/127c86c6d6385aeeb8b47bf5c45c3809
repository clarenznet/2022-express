Martin Brundle has dismissed any chance of Red Bull star Sergio Perez coming close to winning the 2022 Formula One Drivers' Championship with the season just days away from commencing.  Perez, 32, started his career in 2011 for Sauber, collating 14 points during his spell there. As time passed, he gradually increased his points tally for each season. This prompted Red Bull to give him a contract in 2021 after signing him from Racing Point, and he duly came fourth in his first year at the Austrian outfit with his highest points tally yet of 190. With the new season set to get underway on Sunday, fans and pundits alike are predicting who will come close to the title this season, with Perez one of the frontrunners in the conversation. But Brundle believes that the Spaniard has no chance of winning a title, citing Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton's prowess as the reason why. “For a whole season, no, I honestly don’t think so," Brundle said.  "I don’t think he’s on the same level as Lewis and Max. Nobody is at the moment. The real question is whether George [Russell] or anyone else can get to that level. “I’m a big fan of both Ferrari drivers. Doesn’t everyone want Ferrari to do well in Formula 1? So I hope that this year we will have four or five teams competing throughout the season. But at the moment you can only go for Max and Lewis over a season until someone proves they can fight for the World Championship as well. “If you look at Sergio’s points tally compared to Max and Valtteri’s points tally compared to Lewis over five seasons, it says it all, doesn’t it? These guys are one step ahead.” Perez has won two races in his life, with the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix being his first ever win."  Last season, he won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix to give himself an increased standing in the game. But being behind Max Verstappen could mean he may be treated as the 'second driver' of Red Bull. The season gets underway in Bahrain on March 20.
