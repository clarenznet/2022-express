Nearly half of those who feel unproductive are losing an hour or more a day due to low energy levels – that’s more than six working weeks lost due to sluggishness per year. And with 46 percent struggling with productivity during work hours, this could cost businesses £3,500 a year per employee. For the average size SME, this adds up to almost £438,000 annually. Low energy levels are cited as the primary cause of unproductivity, with two-thirds struggling to get through the day. But many are baffled about how to improve energy levels – with just a quarter aware of the positive impact diet can have, despite food being a primary energy source. TV star and fitness fanatic Mark Wright, spokesman for California Almonds, which commissioned the research, said: “Between training, work, and spending time with family, my days are always so busy, so I have to make sure I’m as productive as possible to fit it all in. “A productive morning is essential for me to get everything done, so choosing the right fuel at breakfast is vital and sets me up for the day.” The study also found that 43 percent struggle with productivity in the morning – but two-thirds don’t believe a balanced breakfast fuels them first thing in the day. And six in ten never choose food with energy in mind. Nearly two-thirds (60 percent) opt for quick boosts like toast and coffee, which provide a short-term energy kick, but can also contribute to the 11am slump. And with one in five Brits finding themselves extra productive at 10am, prioritising slow-release energy foods, such as wholegrains or nuts like almonds, can improve productivity. Mark Wright added: “I love opting for almonds to provide energy for my day as they contain protein, fibre and healthy fats, all of which deliver a slow-release energy. “What’s great is that a handful (30g) can help keep you going strong, so even if I’m rushing out the house, they’re perfect for an on-the-go snack.” MARK WRIGHT’S TIPS FOR A PRODUCTIVE DAY:
