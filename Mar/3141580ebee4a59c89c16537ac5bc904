The cross-party Women and Equalities Committee claimed the House of Commons does not properly represent the public because it is unrepresentative of society. Just 5.7 per cent of the 650 MPs are women from minority ethnic backgrounds, it was revealed. In the report, Equality in the Heart of Democracy, the committee warns of abuse faced by female politicians. Committee chair Caroline Nokes said: "As Parliamentarians, we are meant to represent those we serve. At present, we simply don't."
