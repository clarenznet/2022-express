Beaming blisteringly quick downloads into your home just got a whole lot cheaper. That's all thanks to a new deal from UK Internet Service Provider Community Fibre which is offering its speedy 1,000Mbps service for just £30 per month. To put that price into some perspective, Virgin Media's Gig1 option - which also offers speeds of around 1,000Mbps - currently costs £62 per month. That cost makes Gig1 over twice the price of Community Fibre. Anyone signing up to 1,000Mbps speeds will be able whizz a full HD movie to their TV in under 40 seconds - that's around XX times faster than the current UK average. Along with those rapid downloads, Community Fibre customers also get a unlimited downloads and access to a Wi-Fi 6 router which offer faster and more reliable speeds. There's also free installation and no upfront fee to pay. Of course, like most things in life, there is a catch. Community Fibre is currently only available in around one million homes which is significantly less than the 15 million properties that can get Virgin's Gig1 service.
