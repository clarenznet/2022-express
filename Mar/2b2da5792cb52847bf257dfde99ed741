Joining Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister will observe a minute’s silence at noon on March 23 – the second anniversary of the first lockdown. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, will also take part.  Spearheaded by end-of-life charity Marie Curie and backed by the Daily Express, more than 350 organisations are contributing to the event. Families can now be with loved ones, free from restrictions, to remember those who have died. Marie Curie will host online talks with stars including Downton Abbey’s Jim Carter and TV presenter Mel Giedroyc. Buildings and landmarks will be illuminated in tribute, while “Walls of Reflection” – on which those who lost their lives can be commemorated with photos and messages – will be set up across the country. Mr Johnson said: “On Wednesday we reflect as a nation. “The toll this pandemic has taken across the globe is immeasurable. The National Day of Reflection is a chance to come together, mourn and offer our collective support and sympathies to all those grieving.

I saw first hand the heroic efforts of NHS staff and I pay tribute to them, the grief counsellors, charity workers, and friends and families.” Sir Keir said: “As we emerge from the pandemic, we must not forget the long trail of grief it leaves and the profound impact it has had on us all. For so many life is now permanently altered, and we won’t forget it.” Sir Lindsay Hoyle said: “None of us will ever forget the experience of Covid, or the amazing work of the NHS and other key workers, so the Speaker’s Chaplain will include a mention of the National Day of Reflection in prayers before the Chamber sits on March 23.”
