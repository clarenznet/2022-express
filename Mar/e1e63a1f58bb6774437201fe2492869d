Mohamed Salah is understood to have reported for Liverpool training before lunchtime, just hours after he endured World Cup play-off heartache with Egypt against Senegal. The Pharaohs were beaten on spot-kicks by their rivals for a second time in as many months as they crashed at the final hurdle on the road to Qatar following a 1-1 draw over two legs. Unfortunately, Salah was forced to shoulder some of the blame after he skied his penalty from 12 yards before watching team-mate Sadio Mane fire the winner. However, it appears the forward wants to get back to business with Liverpool pronto to avoid dwelling on the disastrous defeat. The Times claim Salah was back on Merseyside and at Kirkby for training before lunchtime on Wednesday, despite the match in Senegal finishing late on Tuesday evening. A private jet was on hand to whizz Salah back to the North West from Dakar after the agonising blow.
