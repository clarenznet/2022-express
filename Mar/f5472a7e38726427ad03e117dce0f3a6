  ITV talk show host Lorraine Kelly has recalled the serious wardrobe malfunction that spurred her on to lose weight in a new episode of the podcast Wellness That Works. The star has previously been candid about the fact that she had gained weight over lockdown due to forming several unhealthy lifestyle habits.     Lorraine, 62, spoke about how she was dismayed to find that she had gone from a size 10 to a size 14 during lockdown, after she started letting her healthy routine slide. Speaking in the podcast to hosts Pip and Jason, she explained: “It was weird, you know, the way it kind of just crept up on me. “I went from a size 10, and then I was a 12, and then towards the end of last year, and the start of this year, I was a 14. “And then - this is so embarrassing… I was doing an interview with The Wanted, you know, that lovely wee boy band? They’re so cute and lovely. READ MORE: Craig Revel Horwood speaks on 'falling in love' with Strictly co-star       “And I had a size 14 dress on and it was straining at the bosom. And the button popped!” she exclaimed. “I leaned over and the button actually popped and nearly hit one of them right in the eye and that was the wake-up call. “That was the beginning of January and I thought come on, this is not good.” Lorraine went on to quip that the "health and safety" issue caused by her dress in the ITV studios meant she had to make a change.     Lorraine recently revealed in an exclusive with Express.co.uk that she has teamed up with WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) in hopes of getting her “va va voom back”. The star agreed that, while the perfect size is different for every person, she wanted to get back to feeling like herself again. “It’s not about how much space you take up in the world,” Lorraine explained. “It’s about what’s right for you. It all comes down to confidence, doesn’t it?” Lorraine went on to admit that she had set herself a “target”, which is to be able to fit back into her favourite red dress.

She looks ok!’ but it’s really about you. And I was feeling kind of tired.      “It’s about losing your shine, losing your sparkle. I just felt really tired and a bit dimmed, honestly. “But we’ve all felt like that. Just because I have to be on the telly doesn’t mean to say that I don’t feel not-as-confident on some days.” Lorraine also condemned diet culture during the interview, instead suggesting that aiming towards a healthier lifestyle overall was a much better way to go. “I think the main thing for me is that I just want to get my va va voom back ,” she said. “Just to get me back from before the pandemic. And I know I can do that because I’ve done it before, but this time I just wanted a helping hand. “It’s not about weight anymore, we’ve advanced, we’ve moved on. That’s really what I want to get across - and avoiding stupid dieting because it doesn’t work!” Listen to the latest episode of the Wellness that Works podcast here.
