Will Smith took to the stage after he won the award for Best Actor at the 2022 Oscars. This win came after an incident earlier on in the night when he slapped Chris Rock over a joke. The actor won for his role in King Richard as Richard Williams, father to Serena and Venus. He began his speech by speaking about how Richard was a "protector of his family." Will continued about the industry: “I’m being called on in my life to love people and to protect people, and to be a river to my people. “I know to do what we do [as actors] you gotta be able to take abuse.

"And you gotta smile and pretend that’s ok.”  Will also explained why he was crying as well.  He said: “I’m not crying for winning an award, it’s not about winning an award for me. “It’s about being able to shine light on all of the people Art imitates life. "I look like the crazy father just like they said about Mr. Williams. "Love makes you do crazy things.”  Will apologised to the Academy during his speech, adding: “I hope the Academy invites me back”. However, he did not apologise to Chris during his speech. This all came after earlier in the evening, Will had appeared to hit Chris. The comedian had made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith's hair, saying he was looking forward to GI Jane 2.  At the remark, Jada rolled her eyes before Will came onto the stage. He then slapped Chris, leaving the comedian in shock. Chris said: “Oh wow, wow, Will Smith just smashed the s*** out of me.” Will could then be heard saying: “Keep my wife’s name out of your f*****g mouth.”
