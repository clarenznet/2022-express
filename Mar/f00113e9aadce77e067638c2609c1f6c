PC Adnan Arib, 45, got the mobile numbers of both girls, aged 15 and 16, asked if they had boyfriends and invited them out for drinks. The 16-year-old first met the married officer at Bethnal Green police station, east London, after she had been reported missing. She felt "uncomfortable and a bit weird" when he told her she was "very pretty" and invited her out. Arib then sent the girl 47 texts asking her to meet him. The 15-year-old, who met Arib after her mother had accused her of stealing, later met him in a park - but said she felt his "intentions were of a sexual nature". Arib claimed he wanted to offer the girls "career advice". However, he was found guilty of two counts of misconduct in a public office at Southwark Crown Court.  Judge Deborah Taylor told him: "There was a sexual undertone to your behaviour." She added: "The public must see that very serious punishment will be visited on those who betray the trust given to them and don't live up to the high standards required by any police force." Arib, who will serve half his sentence, has been suspended. But his lawyer said the loss of his career and reputation is "inevitable".
