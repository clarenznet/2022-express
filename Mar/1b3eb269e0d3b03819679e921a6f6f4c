The customer, who just wants to be referred to as Paul, tucked into a beef and vegetable pasty last week only to find it was completely hollow. He had no time to return to the bakery in Hull city centre to complain but was "quite annoyed" to have spent £1.85 on a "shell" and remained hungry. Speaking today to Hull Live, Paul said: "When I received the pasty I saw it was an unusual shape and I thought, 'this is strange'. On my way back to work, I bit into it and realised that it had no filling in it at all. "I was quite deflated. I paid £1.85 for a shell - a very disappointing shell. "I showed my friends and they all laughed at me. I was quite annoyed in the end as I didn't have time to go back, so I ended up without any lunch. You just wonder, 'how did that get out on the shelf?'" But the experience hasn't put the man off returning to Greggs bakeries in future as he still regards the brand as one of his favourites.  "I'll still go back to Greggs because it's my favourite, but I'll have to check the weight of my pasty next time before I leave. They can trick me once, but they won't trick me twice," Paul continued. Greggs serves a variety of pastries, including the cheese and onion bake and the steak bake. The huge chain, which has more than 2,000 branches across the UK, has apologised for Paul's experience. A spokesman said: "Oh crumbs! We certainly didn’t intend for our Beef and Vegetable Pasty to be given to this customer without the tasty filling. "We’d love the customer to get in touch with us through our customer care team so we can put it right for them."
