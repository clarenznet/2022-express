The Lady with the Lamp told protege Jessie Lennox that the body running an "industrial boys' home" had blocked the appointment of a female matron. She said the committee "does not seem to think a woman has any business" in the barrack huts and while she approved of military discipline, the boys would benefit from a "mother figure". Nightingale wrote in 1887: "I do not expect to get her at all...it will not be a nurse to a hospital but rather to prevent the boys having to go into hospital; to look after them & mother them." The letter is among 15 she sent to Miss Lennox, one of the first Nightingale nurses, signed with her name or FN from 1883 to 1896. In another, Nightingale - credited as the founder of modern nursing - took great pride in the progress of her reforms. She stressed the importance of "cleanliness, ventilation, bedding and warm clothing", adding that a matron ought to "mother & care for all the nurses". Lennox trained at the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing at St Thomas's Hospital, London, in the 1860s - the world's first such professional establishment  She was matron of the Sick Children's Hospital in Belfast for 18 years, dying in 1933 aged 103. The letters were left to Dr Lilias Maclay, a friend, and stayed in her family. They are being auctioned at Bonhams of Knightsbridge, London, tomorrow with an estimate of Â£6,000. The firm's Sarah Lindberg said: "Even the great Florence Nightingale was frustrated in her work by bureaucracy and endless committees run by men." She was known for transforming the care of wounded soldiers in the Crimean War in the 1850s and died aged 90 in 1910.
