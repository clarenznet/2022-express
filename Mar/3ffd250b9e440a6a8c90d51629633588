Will Smith was all smiles with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith and his children Jaden, Willow and Trey. The family arrived at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party on Sunday evening where Will proudly held up his award for Best Actor. The Smiths looked stylish in their outfits, with Will and his son Trey wearing matching black tuxedos, while rapper Jaden opted for a bright pink suit with ombre detailing. Will’s daughter Willow made a statement in a co-ord consisting of a bralet with red embellished sleeves, and black wide-leg trousers. She accessorised with black sunglasses, gloves and silver jewellery. Jada changed into a stunning nude floor-length gown, which was adorned with glittering beading and featured a glamorous cape with a long train. The family’s arrival at the Los Angeles bash came after Will appeared to slap Chris Rock after he made a joke about Jada’s shaved head. Chris joked that he was looking forward to seeing her in “GI Jane 2”, which left Jada rolling her eyes before Will stormed onto the stage and seemingly punched the comedian in the face. When he returned to his seat, Will shouted: “Keep my wife’s name out of your f***ing mouth.” Later in the evening, Will won the Best Actor award for his role as Richard Williams in the film King Richard, where he plays the father of tennis players, Serena and Venus.
