Millions of Britons swept up in the cost of living crisis are anxiously awaiting Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech today as he prepares to issue an update on the state of the economy. He will appear in the House of Commons at 12.30pm and outline how the Government intends to help those anticipating financial hardship. While they wait, people have an opportunity to potentially extend their income by checking their income tax rate, which they can do in a pinch. In the UK, people's income falls into three tax brackets after they exhaust their personal allowance. The Government allows people to keep 100 percent of their first £12,570 earned. After that, they will have to pay a tax rate between 20 percent and 45 percent.

The higher rate doubles the taxable income threshold to 40 percent on earners taking in between £50,271 to £150,000, while anyone earning over the latter amount is on 45 percent. But it isn't always this straightforward, as some people may find they pay more than they should. For example, employers may implement an emergency tax code that takes up to 40 percent of a paycheque if they don't know an employee's code. Employees then have several avenues to discover whether they are on the correct band. The first option is heading to the Government's in-house tax calculator here (Estimate your Income Tax for the current year). The tool requires an overview of people's financial situation before and delivering an approximation of how much they pay in income tax and National Insurance, as well as estimated take-home pay. Not everyone can get an estimate on this system, however. According to the Gov.uk website, the service is primarily for those in active employment. The following people cannot claim an online estimate: They can call HMRC on 0300 200 3300 from within the UK and +44 135 535 9022 outside to discuss taxation.
