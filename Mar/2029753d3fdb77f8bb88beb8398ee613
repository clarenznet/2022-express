The Rejoiner peer invoked the memory of Britain's wartime Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, in response to news that Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine submitted applications to join the European Union. Lord Adonis tweeted: "At this rate, Britain will soon be the only European country not in the EU. Churchill would have been appalled - and alarmed." His remark prompted one fellow Twitter user to ask whether Lord Adonis really thought the EU should include Turkey or Switzerland, adding that Norway would never join and Poland and Hungary both want to leave. A second Twitter user chimed in, saying: "UK was the voice of reason that was not listened to when in EU. If Brexit is the price that had to be paid for EU to wake up and start listening to reason, then it was worth it." A third raged: "Britain is leading NATO's response to Putin's aggression and dragging the EU with them. If not for UK Russia would own the EU now. In fact the EU is still balking at applying sanctions due to its vested interests in Russian energy. We're seeing Brexit in action." And a fourth commented: "Just a quick reminder; most countries in the world are not in the EU. Most seem to manage."   FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
