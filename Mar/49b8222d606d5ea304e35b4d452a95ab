Back in 2011, Andrea Bocelli performed one of his most iconic concerts in Central Park, New York. The Italian tenor was dressed in white as he was accompanied by the Westminster Symphonic Choir and New York Philharmonic Orchestra. The evening was dedicated to the memory of his late father, who had away dreamed of going to the city. SCROLL DOWN FOR O SOLE MIO VIDEO. Now Bocelli has shared a clip from his goosebump-inducing rendition of O Sole Mio, in which you can see an enraptured crowd singing alone. The well-known Neapolitan song was written in 1898 by Giovanni Capurro and was composed by Eduardo di Capua and Alfredo Mazzucchi. Translated into English it literally means “my sun” or “my sunshine”. Last year, the Italian tenor released a 10th anniversary album of the show, with the track included, called Concerto: One Night in Central Park.

Remembering the special occasion he said: “That was a memorable milestone in my career. One of its highest and most emotionally overwhelming moments. A mega-show that took 16 months of work, as well as a brave and ambitious artistic undertaking. A concert that went on to become my first fully live album, for which every note was recorded live, without a safety net.”
