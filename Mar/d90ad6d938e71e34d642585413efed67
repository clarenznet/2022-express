The Duke of Sussex appeared in a video posted on social media on Saturday getting in the spirit for the Invictus Games in The Hague next month. It comes after it was confirmed Harry, who is living in California with Meghan Markle, will miss the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service at Westminster Abbey on March 29 amid a row over police protection while in Britain. A source told The Sun: "It is such a shame that he will miss his grandfather's memorial service. It was supposed to be a time for the family to all come together to remember a great man. "It was also hoped that the Queen would meet his daughter Lilibet for the first time and that would make it even more of a special occasion. "Now none of that will go ahead - yet he is willing to travel to Holland for the Invictus Games, which is only 300-miles away. It will certainly raise eyebrows and most probably hurt feelings."
