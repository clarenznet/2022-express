Jamie Lee wore a floor-length, high-necked navy gown for the evening. The Stella McCartney look featured diamantes sewn into the mesh fabric. To match the statement gown, Jamie Lee kept her make-up natural as she showed off her trademark silver hair. The actress, there to support the Everything Everywhere film, also shared her solidarity with Ukraine by wearing a blue ribbon on her ring. Jamie Lee posted on Instagram earlier this evening to celebrate her team. She posted a picture of her in her gown, as she penned how she was in the “glow”. She wrote: “In the light and the glow of the miracle of creativity and films and all things @theacademy and their OSCARS! “Wearing @stellamccartney @cathywaterman and representing @everythingeverywheremovie @seanjameshair @gracegraceahn @jrossgirl.”
