When she stepped off the plane in a bright yellow dress, she had it swept back into a ponytail. For this engagement, the Duchess had styled her hair in a sleek straight fashion, as she has done for most of the trip to the Caribbean. Kate took a funny picture with William in a bobsleigh with the Jamaican Bobsleigh team. This is about the famous Jamaican Bobsleigh team who made it to the Olympics in 1988. Royal fan @loveforcambridg tweeted: "Ah what a beautiful picture for them to treasure forever." Twitter user @r_boukhenoufa wrote: "So beautiful." Meanwhile, social media account @a_sc87 added: "Epic picture!"  Some royal fans were confused why Kate had changed her outfit again. Royal watcher @sharprednails tweeted: "Why does Kate keep changing her clothes every five minutes?" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will spend the next few days in Jamaica enjoying the sites. They will conclude their tour in the Bahamas. For this occasion in Jamaica, Kate wore the Cha Cha hoop earrings from Danish designer Maria Black. Featuring pearls and a gold-plated charm design, the earrings added an elegant touch to Kate’s outfit. The hoop earring is priced at £152 up for one, and is £298 up for two.
