In a letter to the UK foreign secretary and her EU counterpart, the UK trade and Business commission said the current situation "is simply not delivering" for Northern Ireland businesses. They welcomed ongoing negotiations but said progress is "yet to be made". The letter finished with a plea to work together saying: "The terrible events in Ukraine underline that the UK and the EU are together facing great external challenges and thatâ€™s why we should urgently work to deal with matters that threaten to divide us at a time when it is so important that we remain united."
