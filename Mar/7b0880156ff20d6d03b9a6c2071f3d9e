The former supermodel, who was notorious for her partying ways in the 90s and early noughties, attended a star-studded, post-show Burberry event in London. The 48-year-old, who showed her wild side in a chic animal-print dress with a daring split, left the event with a pal, fashion photographer Mert Alas. But it wasn't like the old days as Kate has reportedly gone teetotal and is in a steady relationship with German aristocrat and photographer Count Nikolai von Bismarck. She has even reportedly moved from London to the Cotswolds seeking a quieter life. Just hours earlier, the motherof-one had supported friend and Burberry chief creative officer RiccardoTisci, 47, at the brand's latest collection launch in Westminster's Central Hall. She was joined by fellow ex-supermodel Naomi Campbell, who at 51 welcomed her first child last year, a daughter whose name she is not revealing. Naomi posed with her famous friend before heading to the dinner in a catsuit with co-ordinated blazer.
