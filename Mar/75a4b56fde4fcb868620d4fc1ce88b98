Speaking in the clip, Sir Rod began: "I'm repairing the streets where I live because no one can be bothered to do it. "With a few of my mates." In another video, Rod explained: "This is the state of the road near where I live in Harlow. "It's been like this for ages.  "People are scraping their cars up. And the other day there was an ambulance with a burst tyre. "My Ferrari can't go through here at all." He went on: "So me and the boys thought we'd come here and do it ourselves. "Filling in the holes while millions and millions of pounds have been spent on the M11 [referring to nearby works on a new junction 7a at Harlow]." DON'T MISS...
