Barcelona have placed as many as seven players up for sale in a desperate bid to clear out Xavi's squad ahead of summer, according to reports in Spain. It's an all too familiar pattern for the Catalan giants, who are now looking to rectify the mistakes of the past by easing the club's financial struggles. But the board do not have just money in mind. Xavi is already showing huge ambition following his appointment in November and he wants to improve the club's squad in all departments. He has already brought in Ferran Torres, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Adama Traore (loan) in January. All three have helped Barcelona turn their season around after moving up to third place in La Liga. Not only that but Barca also sent out a clear statement of intent by thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 in El Clasico.
