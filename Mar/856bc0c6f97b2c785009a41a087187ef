Lance Bombardier Les Pring held off Nazi forces for several hours while holed up in a church bell tower in St Honorine La Chardonne. The then 22-year-old - the last man standing from his brigade - ensured the village of more than 700 people was not re-occupied. His June 1944 exploits were never forgotten by locals and he received a hero's welcome when he returned on the 73rd anniversary of D-Day, being mobbed for his autograph.   The church still bears bullet holes from his defence which earned him a Military Medal for his "disregard for his own safety". Its citation states: "He remained on duty in a very precarious church tower which received several direct hits. His coolness in passing fire orders under these conditions gave invaluable help to the defeat of several determined counter attacks." His gallantry was declared "an inspiration to all ranks". L/Bdr Pring served in the 128th Highland Regiment as Allied troops swept across France into Germany.  He had worked in a fishery before the Second World War. Later he married Betty after they met at a dance in Devon and he was a regional manager with Mac Fisheries. They moved to Bath where he became involved with the Bristol NormandyVeterans group as well as playing golf and bowls. His daughter Alison Currall, 71, said: "Dad took great pride in what he did on D-Day and we were so proud. He lived a very full life." Paul Turner, chairman of the veterans group, said: "Les Pring was a true war hero. RIP...you will be greatly missed."  Other tributes to him were posted on social media - Karin Robertson wrote: "Rest easy, Les". While Normandy resident Nathalie Vee commented: "Thank you from Normandy for your service, Sir." L/Bdr Pring is survived by a daughter, granddaughters Verity and Alex and by his great-grandchildren Florence and Freddie. Lance Bombardier Les Pring born 1924, Died March 2022
