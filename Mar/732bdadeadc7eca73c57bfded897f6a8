The Glasgow-based energy firm is refusing to provide energy to new British industrial and commercial customers. A spokesperson said it would honour existing contracts but will stop taking on business customers. Its 4.5 million domestic customers are not affected. The spokesperson said: "The energy market is facing unprecedented challenges and we have taken the decision to exit the industrial and commercial market. "There is no impact on existing business customers, we will continue to honour all contracts and no employees are affected by this decision." Scottish Power - part of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola - owns the Dun Law West wind farm near Edinburgh. Its move follows reports that the UK-arm of Russian giant Gazprom is looking for a buyer and could be put into special administration. A number of Gazprom UK's clients are thought to be considering pulling their business in response to the Ukraine crisis. The firm does not sell gas from its Russian parent, which faces sanctions. Gazprom's 20 percent market share makes it the biggest supplier to businesses in the country. The second largest is British Gas, followed by TotalEnergies and Corona Energy. Scottish Power is in the top 20. Unlike in the domestic market, there is no Ofgem price cap to protect from price rises.  The Government is believed to be monitoring Gazprom UK and one option is said to be special administration. The only energy company so far given this treatment is Bulb. It collapsed in November and needed Â£1.7billion from the taxpayer to keep it going. Gazprom UK's clients include McDonald's, Siemens and hospitals. Between January last year and Russia's invasion, 33 energy firms failed because they could not pass on costs due to the price cap on home energy tariffs.
