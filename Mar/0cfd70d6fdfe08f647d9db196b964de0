Pictures of the big black bin emerged online this week. Chad Miah was left astonished when trying a find a parking space ahead of his friend's wedding as he found the man's bin blocking a spot. Speaking to Birmingham Live, Mr Miah said: "I went to move the bin, but realised the person who did this had drilled it to the ground with a bolt and hook. The bin was attached to a metal chain and had a padlock on it. "They must have gone through some effort to do it, just to save a parking space. I was yanking it, but it wasn't moving. I've seen it all now." "It's pure selfishness." The bin was chained to a residential road in Handsworth, Birmingham, where homeowners have complained in the past about traffic cones being used to reserve spaces. The council has warned residents such tactics may become "obstructions of the highway".  Mr Miah added: "Parking is a big issue in Handsworth and this particular street is a nightmare to drive down. "We all would like to come home with parking outside our homes, but it's not the case." A spokeswoman from Labour-run Birmingham City Council said: "We would ask people to park considerately and respect all road users, and using a wheelie bin to reserve a space on the highway could be deemed an obstruction of the highway." People shared their frustration online after watching the clip. "I'd cut that straight away," one man said. "This is causing an obstruction on the highway. Too many road accidents are caused by leaving such items in the road," added another. But some praised the man, calling the move "genius".
