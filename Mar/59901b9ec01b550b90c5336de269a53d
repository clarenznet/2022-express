If you're reading this article then you probably already know how to play Wordle, but just in case you're new to the popular word game, here's a refresher. Players are given just six chances to guess a different five-letter word each day. You'll need to use the powers of deduction to get the right answer. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Read on for the Wordle 268 March 14 hints...
