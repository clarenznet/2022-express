The heartbreaking revelation comes after the Sky Sports pundit and TV icon left fans concerned during his appearance on Soccer Saturday. Social media was immediately flooded with messages of concern from viewers over the broadcaster's health, who later confirmed that he had developed a speech disorder along with an existing thyroid condition. He said on Twitter: "Just wanted to let a few of you know who tweeted me today that I am ok-ish.” “Alongside my thyroid problem I have developed apraxia of speech and have been working to get my speech back to normal. Some days it can be a little slow and some days it's normal.” “Hopefully I can beat this!" Kamara is concerned that the illness may be related to playing football for more than 20 years. After suffering from what he described as "brain fog", Kamara received a brain scan to see if he was developing dementia. However, his symptoms were instead explained by an underactive thyroid, for which he is now receiving treatment. After the announcement, the former footballer received an overwhelming response from his fans and colleagues. Kamara's Soccer Saturday host Jeff Stelling wrote: “[Chris] you still bring life, energy, fun and understanding to all your reports on Soccer Saturday. We all love you pal. Keep going!" Olympic gold medal-winning hockey player Sam Quek and former footballer Viv Anderson were among many also messaging support. Chris Kamara confirmed that he would be taking a break from his role as a presenter to treat the condition.
