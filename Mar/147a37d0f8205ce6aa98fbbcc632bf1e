Two Russian attack planes, escorted by a further two fighter planes, held nuclear weapons, reported TV4. It described this as a “deliberate act with the aim, of intimidating Sweden”. The four planes are understood to have taken off from the Russian airbase in Kaliningrad. TV4 reports the Russian invasion of Ukraine had prompted the Swedish Air Force to increase its preparedness, so the planes were soon spotted heading for Gotland, a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. They are understood to have been present in Sweden’s airspace for around one minute. He added that, given the current situation, the incident was taken “very seriously”. This was before reports emerged today, on Wednesday, that the plans contained nuclear weapons. TV4 said “the Russian pilots were clear about” the transporting of these weapons.

This comes amid reports Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich could have been poisoned with a modified version of a chemical used during the First World War during Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Investigative team Bellingcat said three people who attended the talks in early March, including Mr Abramovich, only consumed chocolate and water. A fourth who did the same did not come down with any suspected poisoning symptoms. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK said the negotiators cannot have been poisoned by Russian operatives, or “they would be dead by now”.
