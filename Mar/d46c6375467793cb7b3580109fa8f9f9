Oleg Fedko, 30, was out on patrol when his loved ones were killed as troops opened fire on two cars on a road near the city of Novaya Kakhovka in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine. His wife Irina, 27, perished with Sofia, baby Ivan and his parents Oleg and Anna, both aged 56. Oleg's brother Denis said he was speaking to his mother on the phone when they were targeted by Vladimir Putin's forces last Thursday. He told local media: "I was talking to my mother. I kept hearing my mother yelling that there were children [in the car] and 'How can you [do that]?'" Describing when the attack began, Denis added: "I heard little Vanya [Ivan] was crying loudly. He was only a month and a half old. "And then I heard shots. Then there was silence after that and then more shots again." "There were two bursts, each two to three shots long. I realised they were finishing them off." Reports say that Oleg Senior had driven to pick up the family because his son was on duty. It was the same day that Russian troops entered their home village of Veseloye, some 40 miles from Kherson city, and the family reportedly decided to flee again. Local media say Oleg "is unable to retrieve the bodies of his relatives killed by the Russian troops".
