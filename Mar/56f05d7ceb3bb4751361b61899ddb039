Prince William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, enjoyed taking in some of the local culture in the Belize village of Hopkins on Sunday, as part of their official royal tour of the Caribbean. The royals indulged in some chocolate before being invited to dance to some traditional music. But it was Kate’s “flirty” dancing with her husband that set tongues wagging as it became clear the pair still only have eyes for each other. The clip – shared online by a royal fan account – shows the Duchess playfully shimmying toward her beaming husband, before the two put their arms around each other side-by-side. Royal fans took to Twitter to share their excitement, with many speculating this could be a sign of another royal baby on its way. One fan wrote: “She wants that fourth baby!” and another added: “Number four and five on the way!”. William, 39 and Kate, 40, have three children: Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, three. Kate has admitted a few times recently that she feels “broody” when meeting other people’s babies.

After meeting with two eight-month-old baby boys and their parents, she joked: “It makes me very broody. “William always worries about me meeting under one-year-olds. I come home saying, 'let's have another one'.” However, the pair might be hesitant to have another child because of the environmental impact. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have previously said they planned to stop at two to minimise their carbon footprint. So what do you think? Will the Cambridges have another baby? Or do you think three is enough for the planet? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comments section below.
