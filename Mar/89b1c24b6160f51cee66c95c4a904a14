Derek Currie told guests a story they will never forget after witnessing his brother Gary marry long-standing partner Kirstie. Speaking at the DoubleTree by Hotel in Dunblane, he remembered an unusual Christmas morning at the groom's parents. He told the crowd how he came downstairs to a slap from his mother as she told him "what have I told you about bring people back here". But it transpired it was actually his brother Gary who had a visitor in his room. Derek told his audience how he flung open the door, and much to the bride's embarassment, found her "with her legs at ten to two". He continued: "She certainly never came doon the chimney in that position anyway." The Daily Record reports that footage taken at the ceremony shows the bride with her head in her hands at her table. Her husband, with his hand over his mouth, stares at his brother.   The video has been viewed a huge 5.2million times since being posted on TikTok just three days ago. Kirstie and Gary had to postpone their big day twice during the pandemic. Speaking yesterday, Kirstie said: "It was our third wedding date and, at that point, anything would do. "I kind of knew something would happen during Derek's speech, but that is just Derek. I can't complain. "I didn't know it (the video) would blow up so much. "The amount of messages I have been getting is crazy. People are asking "have you seen that TikTok?"    Derek's speech has divided opinion online, with some describing it as "hilarious" and others calling it "mortifying". One man posted on Facebook: "That must have been mortifying." Another Facebook user wrote: "This is so bad." But others lauded the cheeky best man. One woman said: "This best mans speech is hilarious." Another person stated: "Funniest I’ve ever seen."
