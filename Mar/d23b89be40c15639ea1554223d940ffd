Maja Bloom made sure to stun at the Fantastic Beasts premiere last night. The actress looked amazing in a completely blue sheer top dress. The blue flowers covered the actresses modesty, with the bottom of the dress meeting in a ruffled floral skirt. She made sure to support Ukraine, wearing a Ukrainian flag pin. Maja wore her brown tresses in a slight wave, and went for a smokey eyed makeup look. She sported a dark lip, adding a more sultry look to the outfit. Maja wore little accessories for the event, but sported elegant silver stiletto heels. The premiere was also attended by Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Mads Mikkelson, Jessica Williams, and Alison Sudol to name a few.
