The Duke and Duchess of Sussex tied the knot at a lavish ceremony in 2018, held at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, had flown from California to attend, making her the only member of Meghan’s family present. Her father, Thomas Markle, was in hospital with serious heart problems, so Prince Charles offered to walk Meghan down the aisle instead. However, her response was "not quite what he was expecting" according to royal author Robert Hardman. In an extract of his new book, Queen Of Our Times: The Life Of Elizabeth II ​​published by Macmillan on March 17, Mr Hardman wrote: “Feeling for his future daughter-in-law, the Prince of Wales offered to step in, saying he would be honoured to escort Meghan up the aisle of St George’s Chapel to the altar. “The reply, according to one friend, was not quite what he was expecting: ‘Can we meet halfway?’ “Here was an indicator that this was no blushing bride, but a confident, independent woman determined to make a grand entrance on her own.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
