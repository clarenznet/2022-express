David Tennant was playing the Prince of Denmark at Stratford upon-Avon, Shakespeare’s home town in 2008. The couple has been married since 2011 and has five children together. Ty, 19, was adopted from David’s previous relationship while they went on to have three daughters, Olive, 10, Doris, six, and Birdie, 23 months, and a son, Wilfred, eight. Georgia told the Daily Mirror: “I'd just learnt to drive, and the only place I knew how to drive to was to drive to Stratford. I'd do it twice a week. Then I'd be forced to go and watch Shakespeare plays. Hamlet on repeat is a bit much. I put the work in - it was like 27 times I saw it. I really liked him.” David’s performance at Courtyard Theatre was lauded by the critics. Georgia also starred opposite David in Doctor Who in the episode The Doctor’s Daughter where she played his on-screen daughter Jenny. Speaking on the National Treasures podcast, where Georgia challenged hosts Laura Lexx and Will Duggan to visit Stratford, she added: “I don’t understand Shakespeare. I’d like to, but for me, it feels like a skill I’ll never have. “I know my limitations. You’ll find me at the tearoom. It’s a bit like a theme park dumped in an Anglo-Saxon market town. I like the juxtaposition of that though. Shakespeare’s house next to a Starbucks. I like history, but I also want a nice soy latte with caramel.”
