Sarah Wilson and her partner Luke Hooker, both 58, went out for a walk near Folkestone, Kent on Sunday evening, along with their two dogs, Alfie and Bear. But what started as a pleasant walk quickly turned into a nightmare when suddenly Bear, while walking in the dark, slipped on his lead and fell down the cliff. The three-year-old dachshund got stranded at the cliff face and trapped at a gorse. Ms Wilson said: “Straight away I just had that horrible sick, sinking feeling in my stomach and just pure panic. “I then heard this loud barking and realised what had happened.” The couple immediately called for help, and rescuers from the Kent Fire and Rescue Service, as well as the HM Coastguard rushed to the scene, at around 6:50pm. To locate the dog within the darkness, rescuers used a drone with a thermal imaging camera. They soon found him stuck in thick gorse on the steep cliff face. After clearing a pathway to the bottom of the cliff, the rescuers managed to save Bear and bring him back to safety, following an operation that lasted nearly five hours. Describing the event, Ms Wilson said: “It had been a really lovely walk and both dogs had been impeccably behaved, so I can only imagine Bear saw or smelt something and ran off, and I hadn’t realised his lead wasn’t fully secure.” She added that, from now on, she will be wearing harnesses on both dogs during walks and double check their collars and leads before setting off. Now, Ms Wilson has urged other dog owners to be very careful during walks. She added: “It all happened so quickly and just goes to show how important it is to take extra precautions, and I’d absolutely urge all other dog owners to do the same. “I dread to think what could’ve happened and I’m just relieved Bear is home and safe. “I’m so grateful to the crews for rescuing him. They were fantastic and helped to keep us all calm. I can’t thank them enough.” KFRS Station Manager Chris Redmond agreed that owners should take extra care.
