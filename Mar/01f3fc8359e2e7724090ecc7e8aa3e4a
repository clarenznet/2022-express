William, 39, and Kate, 40, are attending the St Patrick's Day Parade on Thursday for the first time in two years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were forced to miss last year’s celebration of Ireland’s foremost patron saint after it was called off because of the pandemic. The year before, the couple were also unable to enjoy the parade after it was scrapped due to most of the regiment being deployed overseas. The short video began with the Duke offering his St Patrick's Day wishes in Irish Gaelic. He said: “Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig oraibh”, which means “Happy St Patrick's Day”. Kate then joined in saying: “We are delighted to wish you all a very happy St Patrick's Day.” William then turned to Kate and said: “How come you got the easy bit?” The Duchess smiled at her husband before the Duke continued with his message. The St Patrick's Day Parade comes in a busy week for the couple, who have several other royal engagements also pencilled in. On Monday they will attend the annual Commonwealth Day service with other members of the Royal Family. Two days after the parade, the couple will also set off on their highly-anticipated tour of the Caribbean. It was confirmed last month that the Cambridges would undertake the trip as part of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The festivities commemorate the 70-year reign of Her Majesty, Britain’s longest-serving monarch. William and Kate’s tour kicks off on March 19, with the couple set to visit Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas before it ends on March 26. They will view historic Mayan sites, visit Belize’s Garifuna community, and find out about its biodiversity.
