On Friday night in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, Unionist activist Jamie Bryson made a speech telling Dublin it “should keep their covetous nose out of the internal affairs of our country”. In a speech condemning the Northern Ireland Protocol, Mr Bryson urged Stormont to “take a lesson from 1912, loyalty goes both ways”. He also said: “As for the Irish Government, keep your covetous nose out of the internal affairs of our country. “You are neither wanted nor welcome in this sovereign British territory. "This isn’t your country, and it's about time you realised that.” It comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was the target of a hoax bombing in north Belfast earlier on Friday.
