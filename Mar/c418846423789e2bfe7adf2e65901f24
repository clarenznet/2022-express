The casting of Kit "Game Of Thrones" Harington as the King formerly known as Hal was hotly anticipated and the delay due to Covid only increased anticipation. He does not disappoint. Harington's Henry makes the transition from club-going princeling to cunning royal strategist with elastic ease. His rejection of Falstaff ("I know thee not, old man") is delivered with a callous disregard for human feelings that characterises his performance throughout. The modern-day setting (business suits, combat gear) is hardly original. But it's enhanced by haunting operatic vocal interludes from some of the cast (take a bow, Adam Maxey) and given authenticity by former Royal Marine Tom Leigh whose military movement meshes with Benoit Swan Puffer's choreography to produce illusory battle scenes of unusual impact. A series of stepped platforms backed by a huge video screen supplies just enough theatrical landscape for the court scenes in England and France as well as the field of Agincourt. Max Webster's production sometimes strains too hard for originality (the French characters all speak in French with surtitles above), which distracts from the refreshed vision of the play. But Millicent Wong's young Chorus and the PowerPoint presentation of Henry's complicated family tree and his claims to the French throne are standout inventions. The horror of Bardolph's (Claire-Louise Cordwell) hanging from a gantry chillingly echoes recent headlines while Henry's wooing of French Princess Katherine (Anoushka Lucas) quickly becomes a political transaction as cold as it is calculating. This is not a match made in heaven so much as across a boardroom table. A strong, stalwart production. Donmar Warehouse, London, until April 9. Tickets: 020 3282 3808
