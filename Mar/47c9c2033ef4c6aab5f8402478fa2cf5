Royal correspondent Jennie Bond believes the Duchess of Cambridge, 40, would have been impressed by her husband's uniform. This was after the couple's most recent joint engagement on March 17. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Mons Barracks in Aldershot to greet the Irish Guards - part of their annual St. Patrick's Day parade.

"Kate is always dropping down to her knees to speak to children or older people in wheelchairs, she's very engaging. "They're increasingly skilled and experienced at what they do. "I can't think of a recent engagement where they've looked unhappy or not relaxed. "They have cracked bringing a measure of lightness to the most formal engagement."
