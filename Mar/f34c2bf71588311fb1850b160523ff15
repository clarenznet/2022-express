The tribute by Harry, 37, was first shown in the BBC documentary Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers. Harry says he does not feel safe in the UK without Scotland Yard protection. He is pursuing a legal challenge against the Home Office. But royal author Phil Dampier said: “That sounds like an excuse not to come back and indicates the rift with his blood family is still bad.” Commentator Victoria Arbiter said although the Queen was not one to hold a grudge, it “surely would be better for Prince Harry to make his peace now, as opposed to living with a lifetime filled with potential regret”. Former protection officer Richard Griffin, who spent 14 years guarding Philip, said: “Harry should have been here to honour his grandfather.”
