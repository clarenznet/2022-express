Students must receive more support to report sexual misconduct by staff and universities should never use nondisclosure agreements to keep victims quiet in such cases. These are some of the recommendations in a report from Universities UK, which outlines steps to "protect students from harassment and harm". Education minister Michelle Donelan said: "Universities have a profound responsibility to protect students from sexual misconduct, especially when perpetrated by those in positions of power, so I welcome this timely guidance." Some universities "strongly discourage" staff from pursuing a personal or intimate relationship with a student. But UUK wants them to have clear policies, collect records on reports of incidents and ensure better support and protection for those who speak out. Separately, more than 47 students have filed complaints against 34 universities alleging they mishandled their sexual assault cases, the Daily Express can reveal. Swansea University and Queen Mary University of London each confirmed four formal complaints have been made about the way they dealt with sexual violence in the last five years. There is no indication that these incidents are related to relationships between staff and students. Fifteen universities said they do not record data on sexual misconduct reports, our Freedom of Information request showed. Sara Khan, of the National Union of Students, said: "Our research in 2018 showed at least four in 10 students had experienced sexual misconduct. "This data shows universities need to do much more to tackle this problem. We know the real figures are likely much higher." Swansea University said it took sexual violence reports "very seriously". "Each and every reported incident is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, always with the reporting student as priority at the centre of our support provision," it added, Queen Mary University was contacted for a comment.
