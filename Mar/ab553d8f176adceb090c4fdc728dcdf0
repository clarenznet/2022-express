Paralympic gold medalist Richard Whitehead and Paralympic powerlifter Ali Jawad appeared on Thursday's instalment of Good Morning Britain to have their say on the decision. They told ITV presenters Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard "the right decision has finally been made". Richard went on to deplore the "disgusting behaviour" of some Russian athletes who "don't actually think a war is going on".  Susanna began: "Richard, sorry, can you just elaborate a little? Did you say you had heard about messages being passed from Russian Paralympians to Ukrainians?" Richard replied: "Yeah, I have seen those [with] threats about bombing their families back at home and it's terrible, it's disgusting behaviour and it just shows the Russians and Belarusian athletes don't actually think there is a war going on at home and how that affects not just the athletes but the Ukrainian community. "We need to galvanise as athletes and promote this war needs to stop and sport is only a small part of what we do."

The debate comes in the wake of the International Paralympic Committee reversing its original decision.The committee announced on Wednesday athletes from Belarus and Russia would be allowed to compete in the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Games under a neutral flag but this was met by a threat of a boycott.The decision was overturned on Thursday and means Paralympians from the two countries can no longer compete in the games which open on Friday.Andrew Parsons, the committee's president, said: "At the IPC we are very firm believers that sport and politics should not mix.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last Thursday and a million refugees have now fled to neighbouring countries.Russia has been intensifying its attacks on major Ukrainian cities in recent days, with fighting raging in the south, east and north of the country.On Thursday, Russian forces announced they have taken control of Kherson which is the first major Ukrainian to fall.Good Morning Britain continues weekdays between 6am and 9am on ITV.
