Dementia refers to a cluster of symptoms associated with brain decline. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease, a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. Your physical appearance is said to also change in the early stages of the condition and may be deemed as early warning symptoms. A recent article published in The Washington Post, entitled ‘Well, that was a weird moment’ further explored unusual early warning signs of dementia. The article starts with the story of a father who began exhibiting odd behaviours. At work he stopped following through with clients, quit returning phone calls promptly, and began taking more breaks. At home he started drinking, watching more TV, and was quick to become angry. The article further explored unusual early signs of dementia to spot pertaining to behaviour and appearance which include: As routines are disrupted by memory difficulties caused by the brain degenerative condition, a lack of personal hygiene is often one of the first indications that someone is having major problems. Previously clean and tidy individuals may begin to look unkempt. Problems with poor toileting habits, bathing, and incontinence cause staining and odours. Appearance, previously important, gradually loses meaning. Facial expression in people with dementia may also be affected and may be deemed as first early warning signs.

People with dementia may also reflect feelings of anxiety, depression, agitation, bewilderment or a lack of feelings. Other early warning symptoms could include:
