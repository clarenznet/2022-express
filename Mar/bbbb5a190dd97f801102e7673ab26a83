The heir to the throne went to Winchester to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and to see a statue of Licoricia, a prominent money lender murdered in 1277 during a period of antisemitism that led to the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290. The Ukrainian flags had been handed out by Hampshire County Council, which also flew the besieged country's flag from its headquarters. Charles, 73, praised the work of charity World Jewish Relief, of which he is patron, for its work to ensure humanitarian aid reaches war-torn Ukraine. The Prince said: "They are doing wonderful things." Meanwhile, in a sign of her continuing recovery from Covid, the Queen yesterday welcomed two new High Commissioners to the UK. The 95 year old spoke to the diplomats in Buckingham Palace from her Windsor Castle home via a video link. Last night Downing Street said the Palace had approved a knighthood for former education secretary Gavin Williamson - just months after he was sacked for his handling of the pandemic exams fiasco. Labour's Wes Streeting commented: "Reward for failure. Shameless."
