The plan will see soldiers in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania reach a "brigade strength” of 5,000, up from the current 900 British troops in the Baltics serving alongside Danish and French soldiers. Many are also urging states to switch from a "deterrence" to a "full-scale defence" mission, as Putin's bloody war sees no signs of abating. Discussions over the plans will take place during a video call of defence ministers from NATO's 30 member states next Wednesday. Anthony Blinken, US Secretary of State, has said NATO is considering more permanent troops in the Baltics. His British counterpart, Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: "We have to strengthen NATO, we particularly have to strengthen the eastern flank. We’ve already deployed more troops into Estonia but there’s more to do." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
