A ceasefire will be put in place from 7am GMT in an attempt to open humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy. The new deal comes hours after Russian troops "opened fire" on a family during an evacuation across a bridge. Oleksandr Markushyn, the mayor of Irpin, reported seeing four of those people die: “A family died in front of my eyes. Two small children and two adults died.” At least four other people were killed by Russian forces during the botched evacuation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a fresh warning to Russia on Sunday night, to say his country will “punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war”.
