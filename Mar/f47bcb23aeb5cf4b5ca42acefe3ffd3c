Speaking in Brussels this afternoon, Mr Stoltenberg warned of more suffering despite the previous suggestion that Russia was withdrawing from most areas. Mr Stoltenberg said: "According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning. Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region. At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering." This warning comes just days after Russia's Defence Ministry claimed it would scale back the invasion to concentrate on the "liberation" of the Donbas region. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
