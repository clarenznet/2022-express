It comes just weeks after a man spotted what he said was a “shark fin” in the water in nearby East Sussex. According to The Daily Star, Georgia Tournay-Godfrey came across the creature at 8.50 am.  She said: “My first thought was that the great white had it for breakfast. “Its head was missing. “It was pretty gruesome.” However, there are others who don’t believe the shark killed the dolphin.

He said: “Analysing the photo it is obviously a shark - this can't be disputed. “I've always thought there was a shark there as there have been so many sightings by fishermen, but James has managed to photograph the fin. “It can only be a small, immature great white who was looking for seals or bass to eat as they are more likely to come in close (to land) to feed.”
