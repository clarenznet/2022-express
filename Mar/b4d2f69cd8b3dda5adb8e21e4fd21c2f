  The Birmingham beauty, 27, shared the latest snaps from her holiday in St Lucia with her 19.1 million Instagram followers. Demi lay on a rock with her eyes closed on the dreamy looking beach, before heading out to sea on a boat to watch the sunset. The star’s bikini featured ruffled straps and plunging design that highlighted her impressive cleavage. Demi wore mismatched yellow thong bikini bottoms and styled her hair in beachy waves.  She cheekily captioned the picture: “The art of seduction”. The star could later be seen gazing at the sunset from the water in a sheer bikini with a flower design to protect her modesty. The snaps come after a string of racy photos from Demi’s luxurious holiday that left little to the imagination. The star went braless for a number of pics and even flashed her bare bottom by the poolside in one photo.
