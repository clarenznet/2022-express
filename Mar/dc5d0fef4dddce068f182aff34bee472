By comparing recent observations with 100-year-old eggs in museums, scientists determined about a third of the bird species nesting in Chicago, US, have moved egg-laying up by an average of 25 days. The research, in the Journal of Animal Ecology, says the shift is likely from rising temperatures. Dr John Bates, curator of birds at the Field Museum, said changes in climate can translate to different plants blooming and insects emerging - things that could affect the food that is available for birds. He said: "The majority of the birds we looked at eat insects and insects' seasonal behaviour is also affected by climate. The birds have to move their egg-laying dates to adapt."
