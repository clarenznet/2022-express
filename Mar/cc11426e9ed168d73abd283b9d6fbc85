Komarek lives in Switzerland and regards Florida as his second home. His $5.5billion (£4.2billion) fortune came from oil and gas in the Czech Republic in the 1990s, following the Velvet Revolution and the end of the communist regime. In 2012, he took over Czech lottery firm Sazka, which he used to build a £7billion European lotteries empire. Other business ventures include IT, real estate and bio medicine. Komarek is married to Stepanka and has four children. When not working 12 hours a day, he enjoys golf, cycling and paddle boarding. His foundation sponsors the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC, as well as the Dvorak Prague International Music Festival.
