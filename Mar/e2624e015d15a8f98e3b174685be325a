The rising price of oil and gas, which has a knock-on effect on food prices, saw UK inflation hit 5.5 percent last week, which was a 30-year high. In response, the Bank of England raised interest rates from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, with financial experts warning a series of further hikes are to follow. The Resolution Foundation, a leading think-tank, has warned inflation is set to reach 8.4 percent by the spring, a level not seen since the 1970s.  It was expected to fall quickly after an April peak, but a prolonged conflict in Ukraine is set to keep inflation at a half-century high throughout the year, with the poorest households most affected by food price hikes. Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the foundation, said: "People should expect inflation to be high for the whole of this year, before it falls in 2023." He added wages will continue to fall in real terms, particularly when businesses across the UK have to increase their prices to account for higher operating costs, interest rates and taxes.  Mr Leslie said: "Households are suffering from rising costs but so are businesses. Many are uncertain what the future will bring, which raises questions for them in how they set their prices." He added: "For the average household we are expecting a four percent fall in their income this year, which is about Â£1,000. "For the poorest households the drop will be five or six percent. Mr Leslie's warning comes as a survey conducted for the Office of National Statistics found 55 percent of retired people in their 50s and 31 percent of those in their 60s are considering returning to work to cope with the cost of living." crisis.
