The 2023 rise will reportedly be far larger than 2022’s due to skyrocketing inflation which the increases are usually based on. Treasury ministers have also reported that the state pension triple lock which was temporarily suspended due to the pandemic will be reinstated.  On April 11, most benefit claimants will receive a boost to their payments by 3.1 percent. This was based off of the inflation rate in September last year, which is usually used for the increase amount. However, the Bank of England has warned that inflation might even hit 10 percent before the end of the year, meaning benefit claimants in 2023 could see this reflected in the next rise. Treasury Minister Simon Clarke told the Commons: "If there is high inflation, as is forecast, during the course of 2022 that will be reflected in the uprating figures for April 2023 and the triple lock will be in place to protect families."   The benefits increasing in April include the likes of state pension, Universal Credit and PIP. The new state pension will increase from £179.60 to £185.15 and the standard allowance for Universal Credit for couples under 25 will rise from £403.93 to £416.45 while those over 25 will see their payments increase to £525.72. PIP will also receive the increase in each aspect and weekly rate. The standard mobility rate will rise from £23.70 to £24.45 and the enhanced rate rising to £64.50. The daily living components will rise from £60 to £61.85 for the standard rate and enhanced rates will rise to £92.40.   In total, claimants receiving both enhanced rates will receive a maximum of £627.60, a rise from £608.60. Some other benefits, thresholds and deductions are currently frozen, which could be a good thing for families struggling with the cost of living. However, frozen thresholds paired with rocketing inflation could see some Britons becoming ineligible for benefits or receiving a lower amount due to increased earnings. For the 2022 to 2023 financial year the below will not be increasing by 3.1 percent.  This is the maximum amount of benefit payments that can be received per household, and the threshold will remain the same for both Greater London and the rest of Great Britain. Both the standard and higher rates for bereavement support for deaths occurring on or after April 6, 2017 will remain at the current level. The standard deduction of £8.40 per week will remain the same for the following 12 months. Both the standard and lower weekly rates are frozen.  This add-on with other benefits such as state pension and short-term incapacity benefit higher rate will remain the same. This includes the weekly rate of £11.35 and the rate for the eldest child which also receives Child Benefit. The maximum for one child and the maximum for two or more children will remain at the current rates. The standard monthly deduction will remain at £36.40. The upper limit, amount disregarded, assumed income from capital between capital disregard and upper capital limit will all remain the same.
