Keighley Whyte, 27, was snapped parking on a street near the Bradford area of Manchester, before two females got out of the car, dumped rubbish onto the side of the road. Whyte then drove away but when waste management company Biffa, working on behalf of Manchester City Council, visited the site the next day, they found evidence from the dumped rubbish linking back to the young woman. Further investigation then showed that the Fiat Punto used to fly-tip the rubbish, near the Etihad Stadium, was registered to Whyte. She failed to attend an initial court hearing for the offence and a warrant being issued leading to her arrest in June 2020. But she eventually was detained and appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates Court on Friday. She was ordered to pay a total of £614 for the offence, reports Manchester Evening News. Whyte, from Clayton, Manchester, admitted fly-tipping at the hearing. Manchester City Council, which is a Labour stronghold, warned residents fly-tipping "blights our environment". Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, Manchester City Council's executive member for Neighbourhoods, said: "This is an environmental crime that doesn't make sense on any level. Not only is it an unnecessary cost to the council, and hence the taxpayer, it was an expensive way for this woman to get rid of rubbish when she could have taken it for free to a local tip. "Once again, we want to send a message to anyone who thinks they can get away with blighting our environment, we will not tolerate fly-tipping in the city, and we will continue to bring prosecutions to court to show that this behaviour is not acceptable in our city."
