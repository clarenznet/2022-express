Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has reportedly made signing Eden Hazard a top priority this upcoming summer with contact already made with his representatives. The Belgium international has suffered a torrid time at the Bernabeu since his dream move to the Spanish capital back in 2019.  Fitness issues have played their part, but he's also fallen out of favour under both Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti. He's started just seven La Liga matches this campaign and hasn't featured in their last three league games. Hazard has also been overlooked on the biggest stage in the Champions League, watching on from the bench as Real produced a remarkable turnaround against Paris Saint-Germain last week. The former Chelsea superstar still has two years left on his contract at Real, but it appears as though his time at the club could be coming to an end. Hazard isn't short of admirers though with a return to the Premier League increasingly likely. And Arsenal could bring Hazard back to London, according to Footmercato.
