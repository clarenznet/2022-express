Hick Swinhoe, 52, bought the home next to his own in Caldecote, near Cambridge, just before the war broke out. He had planned to use it as a "project" property. He changed his mind and was connected to the refugee family via social media and Cambridge mum Rend Platings. Eight of the family then flew from Albania to London Luton. Valeriia Starkova, 37, and her father Mykola Starkov, 59, travelled by car and ferry for four days to bring some belongings and their two dogs. Valeriia said of Mick: "They're saving our lives." The group came to the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme and were helped by relative Roman Starkov, 38, who is a British citizen.
