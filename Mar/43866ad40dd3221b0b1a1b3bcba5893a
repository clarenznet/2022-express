The Njord vessel got into difficulties in the North Sea, about 100 miles west of Stavanger. The Norwegian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre (NJRCC) launched a rescue operation after the alarm was raised on Sunday afternoon. Rescuers found the eight crew members standing on the keel of the boat. A search and rescue helicopter airlifted three people to the Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, where one of them subsequently died. The other five people were picked up by the Olympic Challenger, an oil industry offshore vessel, which had responded to the Mayday relay issued by rescue services calling on boats nearby to assist. They were later taken to Stavanger by rescue helicopter.

A spokesman said: "When we were alerted we sent out resources and found eight people standing on the keel of the capsized fishing vessel.  "Three were taken into a search and rescue helicopter and five people were picked up by boat after we issued a Mayday relay." The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it received a distress alert from the boat's EPIRB at 1.49pm on Sunday in the Norwegian search and rescue region. The Norwegian Coastguard confirmed it had also received the alert and a helicopter had been sent.
