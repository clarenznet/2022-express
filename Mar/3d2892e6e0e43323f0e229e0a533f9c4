Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on "enhanced" combat duty. But US NATO ambassador Julianne Smith has warned NATO territories are ready to be defended by any future attacks. Ms Smith told BBC News: "We do not like Russia talking about any sort of escalation in this space as it relates to their nuclear posture. "We find this rhetoric extremely dangerous and it increases the risk of miscalculation. "What we have chosen to do at this moment is not make any major changes. "We are confident in our ability to defend NATO territory and the United States is very confident in its ability to defend the homeland."

"But what we wanted to do in recent months is to give him a choice. "We laid out two very distinct choices for him; one he could de-escalate and work with us through diplomatic channels, through NATO, or two he could choose the path of conflict and we made clear that there would be consequences if he did that.

"But whether or not he is rational or irrational, I think what's clear is we have held up our end of the commitment to ensure that Russia pays a price for its invasion of Ukraine." More to follow...
