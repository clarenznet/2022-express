Lily Allen, 36, made sure all eyes were on her as she turned up to the 20th GEM Awards in New York City on Friday night. The daring singer wore a completely sheer white gown with intricate lace detail and nothing underneath. She opted to go braless for the evening and her bottom half was only covered by a small frill skirt. Lily styled the gown with a pair of chunky black lace-up boots, a gold clutch bag and layered statement gold necklaces. The hitmaker wore her hair in a high bun with some pieces falling loose to frame her face. A whole host of stars including Blake Lively and Jennifer Connelly attended the awards at Cipriani 42nd Street. The GEM Awards are one of the jewellery industryâ€™s most celebrated events as it honours the work of fine jewellers and watchmakers. London-born Lily lives in the States now following her marriage to Stranger Things star, David Harbour, who she wed in a Vegas ceremony in 2020. Lily is mum to two daughters: Ethel, 10, and Marnie, nine, who she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper.
