In video footage, Ukrainians used cars, trucks and piles of tyres to stop Russian troops from accessing the Zaporizhzhia facility. Hundreds of citizens also stood on the main road leading to the town of Enerhodar. Russian troops began approaching the nuclear power plant on Saturday have aimed their rockets at the site, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Radiation levels at Chernobyl have increased but are still low enough not to pose a hazard to the public despite the movement of Russia's military vehicles there, the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA said on Wednesday. The former power plant was captured by Russian forces on Thursday after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said. Experts at Ukraine's state nuclear agency said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air.

"The readings reported by the regulator � of up to 9.46 microSieverts per hour are low and remain within the operational range measured in the Exclusion Zone since it was established," the IAEA said. Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi added it was of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the zone's nuclear facilities should not be affected or disrupted in any way. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Friday that the critical infrastructure of the plant has not been damaged and essential maintenance work was ongoing. Ukraine's neighbour Poland said it had not recorded any increase in radiation levels on its territory. France-based independent nuclear watchdog CRIIRAD said in a statement Friday it was trying to verify and cross-check the information at their laboratory. "If the dose rates recorded correspond to real values, the situation is extremely worrying," CRIIRAD said, adding that further research is needed to interpret the data.

Another possibility was that the readings were inaccurate as a result of interference from cyberattacks, he said. The area has many high-risk installations, including radioactive waste processing and storage facilities, most of them unsecured, CRIIRAD said. Other reactors in Ukraine also pose a safety risk in case of an accident, the watchdog said. While it was possible to reduce the potential risk by shutting down the reactors, Ukraine depends on nuclear power for more than 50 percent of their electricity supply, it said.
