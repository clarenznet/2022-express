Ex-deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean said shelving the 1.25 per cent increase would be "no problem" and claimed the hike was a "political" decision not an economic one. However, the Chancellor faces growing calls to ease the cost of living crisis in his spring statement next week.  But ministers insist the rise which will cost the average worker £250 a year, is the only way to tackle health service waiting lists. A Treasury source said people wanting the increase "postponed or cancelled are also calling for the NHS not to get £12.5billion this year to deal with backlogs". The NI rise coincides with an unprecedented spike in energy costs as the price cap rises and inflation soars. Sir Charlie, who served on Treasury watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the Government should be worried about "sustained" deficits, not short-term measures. He told the BBC: "There is no problem in the UK borrowing several billion pounds for one extra year. What you can't run is sustained large deficits.  "But the pace at which you close a deficit is basically a political judgement." The statement, a week tomorrow, is unlikely to include big changes. More than 30 campaign groups have urged the Government to provide more support for households.
