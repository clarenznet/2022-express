Some 5.8 million people rely on Universal Credit in England, Scotland and Wales. Almost half of claimants are in work but claim the benefit from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to top up their income. As energy bills and the cost of living crisis continue to dominate the headlines, Britons are being urged to check they are receiving all the Government help they need. In Britain, £15billion is lost in unclaimed benefits every year - meaning millions of people are entitled to extra financial support to help them make ends meet. It’s not just Universal Credit that people could be eligible for - one million pensioners are missing out on Pension Credit. Pensioners could be eligible for Pension Credit if they have reached state pension age and earn less than the threshold which is £177.10 for individuals, or £270.30 for couples.

In addition, claimants could save thousands of pounds more by taking advantage of free prescriptions, reduced travel and home improvement grants. Anyone who isn’t working, or who receives a low income, can apply for Universal Credit as long as they have less than £16,000 in savings.

This is separate to the state pension and is for pensioners on a low income. Pension Credit has the potential to lift hundreds of thousands of older people out of poverty. Nearly one million (850,000) pensioners could be losing out on this extra financial help. It could also mean pensioners on low incomes qualify for a free TV licence, help towards healthcare costs and money towards energy bills. In addition to Universal Credit and Pension Credit, Britons could also qualify for Carer’s Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payments (PIP). People can do a quick online check, there’s a handy benefits calculator on the Government website. They can then apply online or by contacting the DWP on 0800 328 5644.
