Paddy McGuinness, 48, looked very different in a throwback picture he shared yesterday on Instagram. The Question of Sport presenter gave his two million followers an insight into what he looked like more than 20 years ago. In the snap, Paddy could be seen wearing a pair of glasses with a black rectangular frame and a matching baseball cap. The fresh-faced TV star looked away from the camera with a brooding look. Paddy’s hair has also changed throughout the years as he sported longer, curly hair that framed his clean-shaven face. He captioned the post: “Monday. #giveusasmile #monday #startoftheweek #ninetiesfashion” Paddy originally rose to fame thanks to a series of appearances on shows including That Peter Kay Thing, Phoenix Nights and Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere.
