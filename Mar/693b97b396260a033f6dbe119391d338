Jayne Adye, Director of grassroots, cross-Party campaign Get Britain Out, warned that many of the deals which have been struck in the wake of Brexit are "rollover" agreements that do not "reflect the interests and priorities of the UK now and in the future". She warned the Prime Minister that he "must not let the EU's failures linger on" when updating past deals, and making new trade deals as this would be a disservice to the British people. Ms Adye said: "Just as our attitude to trends within the global economy must be flexible, the Prime Minister must also make sure he keeps a close eye on the Department for International Trade, and be ready to make a change in the Secretary of State if Anne-Marie Trevelyan does not deliver on promises made. The Prime Minister must make sure this position - which is so important to the future success of the UK on the world stage - is always filled with someone who is fully up to the job. Such an important position cannot be seen as a throwaway to keep allies of the PM satisfied." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
