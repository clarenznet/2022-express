British drivers are being hit with ever increasing costs that have seen the cost of running a car rise by 35 percent in the last five years alone. From the cost of servicing a car to a rise in the average cost of buying a hatchback of £9,000, driving has never been so expensive. Express.co.uk examined the different costs involved in keeping a car going month to month for an average family car and discovered the alarming five year increases. Car tax changes next month will see even more money demanded as Vehicle Excise Duty goes up once more. They’ve increased £25 per category since 2017, so if your car emits between 76 and 90g per km, your standard rate will rise £165. The cost for the same car five years ago was £140 per year.

Back then the average cost of unleaded was 120p per litre. That has risen this week to 151.2p per litre. It adds a shocking £15.50 to the cost of filling up the average car with a 50 litre petrol tank. And increases fuel costs for drivers over a calendar year by a whopping £400.

The average cost of a family hatchback is now £21,964 according to leasefetcher. That’s a rise of almost £9,000 and will add almost £100 per month to most car financing payments. Toll roads in the UK have also seen a marked increase in cost. The Dartford crossing for example cost drivers £1.67 per crossing in 2017 if they were an account holder. That cost now stands at £2.50 per crossing, a rise of more than 30 percent. Across the UK drivers are also being expected to pay money to drive in and out of cities thanks to Clean Air Zones. 22 of them are to be launched in the UK this year, with most charging the majority of cars a fee between £10 and £15 to enter. London’s ULEZ has been expanded every year since launch, and the congestion charge has also been expanded several times. One area where car owners have had some respite is surprisingly from insurers. Although they are currently in the process of raising premiums after Covid reduced the amount of cars on the roads, premiums are actually less now than in 2017. The average fully comprehensive premium in 2017 stood at £589 per year according to Money Supermarket. But the same premium in December last year stood at just £444. All in all the cost of owning and running a car has gone up some 35 percent when taking into account road tax, insurance, servicing and petrol - and it shows no sign of stopping.
