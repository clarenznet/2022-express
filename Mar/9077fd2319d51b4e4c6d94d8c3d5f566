The monarch, who is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, held an audience with Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin at Windsor Castle. The pair are likely to have discussed the situation in Ukraine at yesterday's meeting. The Queen, 95, was not photographed during the official engagement. Lancashire-born Admiral Sir Tony, 56, was promoted from First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff to the role at the end of November. He said on Sunday that the invasion was "not going well" for the Kremlin, with Russia's military might not proving as strong as expected in the face of Ukrainian resistance. The Queen, who has now recovered after catching Covid just over a fortnight ago, has made a private donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help Ukrainian refugees. She met with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, and was pictured in front of a large bouquet of blue and yellow flowers - the colours of the Ukrainian flag - in her sitting room. The gesture was seen as a symbol of the Queen's support for the people of Ukraine.
