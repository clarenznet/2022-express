In 2003, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gordon Brown came under fire over their decision to involve British troops in the war in Iraq, which lasted from 2003 until 2011. The MP was heavily criticised following his appearance on Monday’s Good Morning Britain after he told ITV hosts Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley the Russian President should be punished for his war crimes against Ukrainian civilians. Explaining how this could happen, Brown began: “Set up a prosecutor and he would compile the case and then they would demand the arrest of Putin. “That would lead eventually to a trial if we could get hold of them. Of course, this is not the only thing we could do.   “I have seen in this morning in the newspapers, an 18-month-old child dying. An innocent child of Putin’s crimes.   “I’ve seen these pictures of people trying to get into Kyiv, leaving their home and three…a mother, a teenager and an eight-year-old have been killed. These are crimes that have been committed by Putin’s troops.”    READ MORE: Ozark season 4: Wendy Byrde death 'sealed' as fans spot huge clue?  He continued: “We’ve got the nuclear blackmail that’s been involved, the breach of the ceasefire, the humanitarian corridors that have been closed when they should be open. “All these things add up to not only war crimes but what is the initial crime? And that’s what we try in a tribunal, a crime of aggression. “The crime of invading Ukraine and continuing to be in Ukraine illegally, he should be brought to trial and so should his conspirators.” Brown went on to add: “We’ve got to send out a message that we’re taking action.” Madeley went on to ask Brown about what should happen to Putin and what punishment should he face. Brown explained the Russian President should get life imprisonment. “He should know that he is being held accountable and that every action is being monitored and we are not going to let him off the hook," he stated. “Russia has become a pariah state as a result of his actions and while we have no complaints about the Russian people, President Putin has to be brought to justice and at some point, he has to be removed.” DON'T MISS...NCIS' Pauley Perrette issues passionate plea against Ukrainian war [REACTION]Vera's Jac Williams star opens up on Kenny Doughty 'faking' scene  [INSIGHT]Emmerdale arrest for Liam Cavanagh after Charles teams up with Meena? [SPOILERS]        Brown’s remarks outraged Good Morning Britain viewers, with many branding the former Prime Minister a “hypocrite” following his involvement in the Iraq war. Munro raged: “@GMB Oh the hypocrisy of @GordonBrown talking about the spirit of the #Ukraine️ people. While I do feel and empathise with them. However, Brown has a cheek! He's spent years talking down his own people and country #Scotland Also same with Blair for invading Iraq.” (sic) Darren tweeted: “I guess we should also call for the life imprisonment of the same leaders in the west who lies us into the Iraq war & turned Libya into an open slave market. Hypocrisy from our leaders and previous leaders knows no bounds.” (sic) While Naima added: “Your hypocrisy is disgusting! Tony Blair, Cameron should be on trial 4 invading Iraq, Afghanistan & Libya.”    Phil continued: “Gordon Brown war criminal - everyone from the architect Alastair Campbell to the salesman Blair and the careerists who facilitated Iraq like Andy Burnham should face trial too instead of being rehabilitated as mental health gurus/peace envoy/regional mayor... country #GMB.” “Will Richard and @susannareid100 ask Ex-PM Gordon Brown if he is planning to hand himself in the International War Crimes court?” Jock asked. “He did facilitate the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq? #GMB.” Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.
