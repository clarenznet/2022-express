Police reportedly dashed to a shop in Ballysillan, Belfast, where it is believed a yob used an accelerant to try to damage and take an ATM machine. Their botched attempt caused an explosion, reports say, and it's feared the "abhorrent crime" could have ended tragically. One councillor in the Northern Irish capital called the act "an attack on the local community" as the cashpoint is the only ATM in the Ballysillan area. It happened in the early hours of the morning, Belfast Live reports, and roads have been closed since then. Councillor Brian Kingston said: "I am told by the North Belfast police commander that there was some sort of accelerant used. "The person repsonsible caused an explosion. They were thinking they could damage the machine. It seems that the person failed in this attempt. "This was an entirely reckless attack."  The attack happened in a residential area, which is in the northeast of the city. Cllr Kingston continued: "There [is] a flat about the shop, people living at both sides, so this obviously could have caused damage to local people. "It is also an attack on the local community. The person responsible had no concern that they were damaging the only free ATM in Ballysillan. "This is an abhorrent crime." Councillor Dale Pankhurst, also of Belfast City Council, said: "I totally condemn this abhorrent robbery attempt that could have ended tragically." He said he understood those responsible quickly fled the scene after the small explosion.  Police continue to hunt those responsible. Cllr Pankhurst added: "If anyone has any information regarding this disgraceful robbery attempt, please ensure they contact the PSNI (Police Service Northern Ireland)." Bus routes and tram services were affected this morning but have since returned to usual.
