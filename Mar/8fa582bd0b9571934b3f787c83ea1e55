This Morning host Holly Willoughby was modelling a floral dress on her latest social media post, while giving fans a teaser about what they could look forward to on the next ITV show. However, she delivered a much more embarrassing message than she'd bargained for after falling prey to predictive text. Typing away on her phone, Holly had written: "Morning Tuesday… great line up today, @schofe and @alisonhammond55 talk to Michael Bible and from what I hear it’s fantastic... see you on @thismorning at 10am." She also hashtagged #hwstyle and tagged the brand @nobodyschild, who had produced the crocheted 'Serena' mini dress she wore in the picture. She soon logged back in to correct herself - but only made things worse. "Bl***y predicative t**s!" Holly raged as soon as she realised her blunder.

Fans flooded the post with hysterical laughter emojis when they saw what her phone had written. "T**s, must be a word often used on your phone," joked @deanos82. Meanwhile @hollywillsuk laughed supportively: "I love predicative t**s." @scottwilliams1024 agreed: "Am not moaning about your t**s!" @nicdobson85 shared in the humour, adding with amusement: "Good old autocorrect at its finest!" Holly's mix-ups with words often stem from her dyslexia, something she's lived with since childhood. DON'T MISS...

"At school, reading out loud absolutely terrified me because I’d get all the words wrong and I was convinced everybody thought I was stupid." The 41-year-old added: "It still happens now – most of the mistakes I make on This Morning are because of it." However, the Dancing On Ice host has found a way to master the condition over time.  "It doesn’t do what it did to me back then because I don’t let it have power," she added to Red magazine, confiding that her attitude was all about how she "packaged" it in her mind. She conquered her uncertainty to the point that she was able to begin an Open University course in the field of Psychology and Psychotherapy. The star has also authored several books, the latest memoir called Reflections.
