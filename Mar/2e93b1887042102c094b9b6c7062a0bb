Helen, who doesn't want to disclose her surname, parked her car on Sunday before heading out for a stroll. She left her blue badge on the windscreen but returned to find a note written in block capitals, which said: "Your BB (blue badge) has been taken and reported to the ticket office." Helen, who is from Bury, Greater Manchester, does qualify for her own blue badge as she has a back problems, has had numerous spinal surgeries, and has nerve damage in her legs.

"And I just thought they've got no idea what my circumstances are." The mum had parked at Heaton Park in Manchester for some recreation on Sunday when another driver saw her and left the note. Helen recently lost a friend to cancer and she had a blue badge too, reports Manchester Evening News. "What if I had been her, and I was here to take my last walk ever, and I came back to this message? How rude can some people be."  Helen said strangers stare at her when she parks at supermarkets - and she confronts people when they do. "Someone once said to me 'are you travelling around with a dead relative's blue badge'," the woman continued. But there was no way for Helen to respond to the person who left this note at Heaton Park. Blue badges are important lifelines for many people suffering from disabilities.
