While the exact sum of the Brexit divorce bill has been disputed by the Government, it’s widely reported to have fallen within the ballpark of £40billion. A look at data published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in 2020 shows just how much the UK is expected to pay – and what it will be paying for – with estimates reaching as far into the future as 2064. According to the OBR, there remains about £25billion of the divorce bill to be paid from the UK to the EU between 2021 and 2057, with the biggest chunk of that – around £18billion – to be paid in the first five years. In the early post-Brexit years, these payments will largely go towards commitments agreed when the UK was still an EU member, but had not yet paid for. These include beneficial ventures such as the Euratom nuclear research programme and Copernicus, the Earth monitoring project. But the data also exposes some lesser-known truths about the Withdrawal Agreement signed by Boris Johnson. The UK Government agreed to pay a share of liabilities for pensions of EU civil servants as part of the deal, which was passed by MPs in the House of Commons and came into law on January 31, 2020. READ THE FULL STORY: UK still sending BILLIONS to EU! Brexit betrayal as Britain to be bled dry for decades   Under this clause, the UK must pay almost £12billion towards the pensions of EU civil servants between 2021 and 2064. And these figures won’t immediately taper off: they are expected to peak in 2030 and 2031, each with an annual total of £459million. The Withdrawal Agreement states that, after the UK’s transition period ended in December 2021, it is committed to paying “its fair share” of pension liabilities” for “benefits accrued on or before December 31, 2020”.
