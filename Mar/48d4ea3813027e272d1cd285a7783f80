We want to hear what you want to know from the British businessman and Reform Party leader. The former MEP will then be asked what he thinks on a range of issues. Mr Tice has taken up the baton of the pro-Brexit Reform Party from Nigel Farage since May last year, and has recently been campaigning alongside him for a referendum on the Government’s Net Zero policy. What would you like to ask Richard Tice? Have your say in the comments section below. In the wake of the massive rise in the cost of living spurred on by the coronavirus pandemic, and with the Government’s announcement that it will cut all Russian oil imports, Mr Tice has called for shale gas to be extracted to help meet energy needs. He has said that ways other than the controversial fracking methods are available to extract shale, and that the UK should be “world leader in wonderful new technologies to extract our bounty, that is owned by us all.” The Government ended the use of fracking in 2019 following concerns about earthquakes and risks to local communities.
