Kate Middleton surprised royal fans with her outfit of choice for a boat ride in the Bahamas. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are visiting Montague Beach for the Royal Regatta, and Kate chose beige shorts from J.Crew for £26.17 and a white polo top, alongside her trusty white pumps for the occasion.  The dark brown belt Kate wore is the same as when she visited the archeological site in Belize - her woven leather belt from Brora. The white polo top is from the marine clothing company Gill. It usually retails for £40 but is on sale for £19.99. Royal fans commented on Kate's outfit, one with the Twitter username @LadyParky79 said: "Omg! She's in shorts!"

This account also tweeted: "I have never seen the Duchess of Cambridge in shorts. "It makes her so real! Have a lovely time!" Royal watcher @BRFguards said: "I know the sun is hiding in Bahamas right now, but wow!   "This two are so freaking HOT that I'm burning here on the other side of the world." This account also posted: "Hot couple alert! "Prince William and Catherine are really lush with each other. "Catherine looks like this is her first engagement for the day. Eternal freshness."  The Duchess donned a white cap and jacket for the boat when she boarded the boat on the water. William and Kate are both experienced sailors. They boarded the small boat today to watch the end of a sailing race involving young people from the Royal Nassau Sailing Club. The Duchess styled her beautiful brown locks in a straight style at the back, perfect for the activities.
