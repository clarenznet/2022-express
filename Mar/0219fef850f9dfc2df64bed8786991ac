President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to MEPs in Brussels via video-link, urging them to recognise Ukraine as a member of the bloc. With a 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks bearing down on his country’s capital Kyiv, Mr Zelensky pleaded with EU politicians. He said: “I can no longer say hello or good evening, because every day is the last day. “Lives are being sacrificed for values, for rights, for freedom, to have the same equality that you enjoy. “We will win, I’m sure. I would like to hear you say that Ukraine’s choice to be part of Europe is also your choice. We want to be members of the EU. Without you, Ukraine will be alone.” Mr Zelensky raised his fist in acknowledgement after receiving a standing ovation from EU officials bowled over by his extraordinary heroism in the face of adversity. His inspirational leadership has been highlighted by his insistence on staying, with his family, in Kyiv. He has remained behind despite the full invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the advancing troops. Meanwhile, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the column of heavy Russian armour moving towards Kyiv would bring “more death, more suffering and more civilian casualties”.
