Cancer is a condition caused by malignant cells that run rampant and trigger the formation of tumours. The self-proliferating nature of these cells is what renders the disease so difficult to treat. Caught early, however, cancer is deemed highly survivable. Some persistent signs when going to the toilet should warrant further investigation by a health practitioner. Cancer referral waiting times have reached an all-time high since Covid disruptions threw medical services into disorganisation. And with more than a third of people expected to experience some form of cancer in their lifetime, experts are urging patients with symptoms to act swiftly. The third most common type of cancer for both men and women is bowel - or colon - cancer, which affects more than 43,000 new people in the UK each year. Unsurprisingly, some of the first complications to expect from the disease usually arise in the lower part of the digestive system.

The procedure involves passing a flexible tube with a camera on the end through the anus and up the rectum. The camera can pick up precancerous polyps, which can be removed and sent to a laboratory for testing. Alternatively, patients may be asked to send off small stool samples that can be checked for traces of blood. While some cases of cancer can’t be avoided, some can be prevented through positive dietary changes. Dietary fibre can protect against cancer by increasing the bulk and diluting carcinogens in waste matter. This in turn limits contact between carcinogens and the lining of the colon. Nutritionists in Cambridge have previously suggested that diets risk in starch may also be majorly protective against bowel cancer.
