Janelle Mon√°e, 36, left little to the imagination as she posed in a very daring cut-out dress at the Oscars. The Make Me Feel hitmaker turned heads as she posed on the red carpet. The dress could have easily caused a wardrobe malfunction for the star, as it featured extreme cut-outs along the front of the dress from top to bottom. This left the singer turned actress's cleavage and toned midriff on full display. The dress' splits met in the middle with a white button, adding an element of elegance to the look. Janelle styled the dress with a small black clutch bag and thin strapped black stiletto heels. She continued to stun fans with her hairstyle, which featured two buns on either side of her head. She went for a subtle make-up look, with slicked eyeliner and a touch of blush. Janelle accessorised with opulent pearl earrings and an array of silver rings.
