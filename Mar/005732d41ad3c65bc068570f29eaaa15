Firefighters were called to a mountain in Rhigos in the Cynon Valley on Monday evening. Two fire engines are at the scene battling the blaze. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have confirmed they are at the scene. A spokesman for the service said: "We were called to an incident at the Rhigos mountain at 7.04pm this evening. “The incident remains ongoing. One fire engine is in attendance and another fire engine is on its way to the incident." The cause of the fire is currently unknown. Footage and pictures from Wales Online show the fire was visible from Glynneath, 4.8 miles away. Cait Emma, resident in Rhigos, told the outlet it isn't the first time she's seen this, but says it is strange for this time of year. She said: "It is unusual for this time of year, it normally goes up in summer time. "I don’t think it was the farmers due to it being lambing season and those poor wildlife losing their habitats. “I’ve never seen anything as big as this. "I think it’s because the ferns and grass are so dry." Another resident, Garan Rhys Thomas, said at 9:05pm the fire looked as though it is dying down. He said: "I've been here all my life and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. “It's not very common in this area. It has happened before but only in the summer months." During 2021, Fire and Rescue Services across Wales dealt with 2,089 grass fires. This was a slight decrease on 2020, however the number of accidental fires in 2021 had increased by 24 percent. In a bid to tackle wildfires, Operation Dawns Glaw was set up by Wales’ Fire and Rescue Services to “reduce, and where possible eliminate the impact of grass fires across Wales”. Peter Greenslade, Corporate Head of Prevention and Protection for Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, and Chair of Operation Dawns Glaw, said: “We want to continue to protect our landscapes, green grassland and countryside that we are all so fortunate to have on our doorstep.” MORE TO FOLLOW
