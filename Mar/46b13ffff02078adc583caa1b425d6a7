State pension payments are essential to many people, and getting the right sum is paramount. However, many people missed out due to an oversight which was confirmed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). It is thought some 134,000 pensioners missed out on the full amount to which they were entitled. According to the DWP, most people impacted by this error were women, and it is a historical issue. Certain errors go back as far as 1985, and it is thought around £1billion of state pension entitlements have been underpaid. At the start of 2021, the DWP took measures to rectify the past errors and mistakes.
