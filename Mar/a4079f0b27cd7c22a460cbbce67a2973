Sky is marking the 50th anniversary of The Godfather with a series of new voice commands, which will be available on both Sky Q and Sky Glass. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, set the standard for the gangster film genre, recounts a gritty tale of crime and power set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It was based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. As the movie, which clinched three Academy Awards in 1973 and spawned two sequels, is fast approaching its 50th anniversary. To celebrate the milestone, Sky has added a collection of iconic quotes from the film to both Sky Q and Sky Glass. No need to make a request to the Don himself, just recite your favourites such as “Leave the gun, take the cannoli”, or the infamous, “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse” into your remote to enjoy The Godfather, The Godfather: Part II, and The Godfather: Part III on your TV in seconds. If you have a Sky Q box beneath your telly, you'll need to make sure you're using the Sky Q Voice Remote. Press and hold the microphone button (on the newest model, this is located front-and-centre of the remote ...but if you've owned Sky Q for a few years, you might have an older remote with the microphone button on the right hand-side) and say the command out loud. Sky Glass owners can use the hands-free function to issue a voice command without the need to hold a microphone button. To do this, you'll need to use the wake phrase "Hello, Sky" which triggers the voice command function. The full list of iconic quotes from The Godfather that triggers the new anniversary function are... It's been a busy few days for Sky. The satellite company recently rolled out five new upgrades to its custom-designed 4K TV, including the long-awaited speaker fascias, which refresh the design of the telly with new colours and designs.
