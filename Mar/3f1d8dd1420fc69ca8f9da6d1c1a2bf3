Sally, who plays Sally Metcalfe in the ITV soap, and her skating partner Matt Evers were the sixth pair to be voted off this series. The actress and Matt performed in the show’s skate-off against BMX racer Kye Whyte and professional skater Tippy Packard. After finding out their fate, the actress said: "The competition is so good, I think it's time for me to go." Judges Ashley Banjo, Oti Mabus, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean all opted to save 22-year-old Kye in the skate-off. Sally, 58, said: "I have had the time of my life. I couldn't have got through this without Matt, you've been such a strength to me, I've loved every second with you. We'll stay friends." What is happening where you live?
