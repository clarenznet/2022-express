Formula One champion Max Verstappen will be hoping to make significant gains after the Dutch driver was forced to retire in the opening season of the Bahrain Grand Prix. The Red Bull driver endured a devastating loss after he failed to finish the race earning zero points last weekend. But the 24-year-old has the support of his girlfriend Kelly Piquet who will likely be cheering him on during Sunday's race. Verstappen has been dating the Brazilian model since the end of 2020, with their relationship continuing to blossom ever since. The duo first announced their relationship with an Instagram post at the beginning of 2021. Taking to the picture-sharing site today, Kelly shared a series of photos as she supported her beau in Bahrain. The model's pictures certainly caught the attention of her 871,000 followers, most notably the last snap. After sharing a photo of the Bahrain International circuit, the beauty shared an image of her belongings which included a Chanel bag and a pair of Verstappen's gold racing boots. The Red Bull driver was pictured wearing the special shoes when he took the wheel in Abu Dhabi last year. Fans flooded the comment section, as Just In Vakras penned: "The race shoes in the last pic." Janet commented: "The content we didn't know we needed." Sonia remarked: "And the last picture with the golden shoe," while Gargosky added: "The last picture is really awesome."
