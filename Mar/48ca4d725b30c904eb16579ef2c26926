Billie Piper, 39, has shared a handful of playful pictures of herself and actress pal Lily James after they attended the British Vogue and Tiffany and Co. party together. She took to Instagram on Monday night to share the snaps. Along with Lily, 32, Billie put on a leggy display in knee-high boots as the two posed next to each other. The stars looked glam as they stood on a staircase before the BAFTAs after-party. In full view of her 469,000 followers, Billie captioned the post: “Out in a big way with my love @lilyjamesofficial.” Lily responded to the post, writing: “I love you.” The I Hate Suzie star flaunted her physique in an all-black ensemble with a sleeveless crop top. She matched the top with a belted and layered mini-skirt, and accessorised her outfit with a pair of hoop earrings. Meanwhile, Pam and Tommy actress Lily donned a black strapless mini dress with a green floral print, which she paired with some eye-catching green boots.
