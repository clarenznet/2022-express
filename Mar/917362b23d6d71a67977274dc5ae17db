British households are facing a rapid rise in the cost of heating and lighting their homes with the energy price cap going up to almost £2,000 from April. This, combined with the deepening rift between Russia - the world’s largest gas supplier - and much of the rest of the world, is causing some to call for fracking to be used to release Britain’s unused gas, much of which is in the north of England. A group of Tory backbenchers sent a letter to Downing Street pointing out that UK shale was the key to “50 years of cheap gas”. Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside.
