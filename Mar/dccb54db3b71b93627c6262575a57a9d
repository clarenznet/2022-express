Phillips O’Brien, a professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews University, questioned the effectiveness of the military operation ordered by Putin. Prof O’Brien said: “The Russian army, like the Soviet army before it, has manifested significant logistics problems for decades. “And [it] seems to have fallen prey to one of the great temptations of many militaries created by dictators – lots of flashy weapons but little consideration about how to deliver them.” It looks like “basic” problems which dogged Russia during the Soviet era, such as poor rations and the maintenance of expensive vehicles, had not been fixed and were “worse” still. Prof O’Brien shared an unverified video that seemed to show civilian vehicles being transported to Ukraine from Russia by train for use in the war effort. He commented: “This should terrify the Russians if it means what it could mean. They are already running out of trucks. “Heck, if this continues, Russia might request a Nato no-fly zone to protect their army as it pulls out of Ukraine.” Prof O’Brien added: “If Ukrainian claims are anywhere near the truth, they are destroying some of the most important...as of today, the Ukrainians have claimed to have destroyed 60 Russian fuel carriers, which would be a significant blow.” Matthew Boulegue, of Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Programme, said Putin’s advisers were likely to be giving him an overly upbeat assessment of the situation. He said: “There’s always the tendency to sweep under the rug the bad news that you need to give your leader. When Putin says things are going according to plan, he generally believes it as people have been feeding him information. "They have a lot of problems they’ve tried to hide and can’t really announce but we see because of all the info coming from open sources.”
