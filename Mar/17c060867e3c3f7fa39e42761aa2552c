Ukraine's air defence destroyed three Russian SU-30CM fighters, one SU-34 fighter-bomber, one aircraft of an unknown type, two helicopters and one operational-tactical UAV. In addition, the land forces reported another downed fighter, a Su-34 bomber, and a Ka-52 helicopter in the north and south, respectively. Authorities said fighter pilots continue their fierce defence of Ukraine's skies. The Air Force Command of UA Armed Forces said: “There were applications - launches of guided missiles, we will clarify and check whether the targets were hit.” Soon after that announcement, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that a SU-25 was destroyed, while a SU-35 was also shot down. These takedowns occurred in the sky just over the Kyiv region. Earlier today, Putin's forces bombed a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of Ukrainians, including children, were sheltering.
