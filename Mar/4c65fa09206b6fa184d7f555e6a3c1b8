Covid cases are on the up across swathes of the UK, even with high vaccination levels and natural immunity to the virus. The sharp rise in cases across most of the country is due to the Omicron BA.2 variant, a more transmissible form of Omicron, the Office for National Statistics has said. The UK reported 215,001 Covid cases across Saturday to Monday, with the uptick coming in line with the end of restrictions across most areas. The news comes as England is due to scrap free lateral flow tests for everyone except the most vulnerable from April 1. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has confirmed that 200,000 school pupils in England are not attending due to being either infected or self isolating. More than 600,000 people will be invited for a coronavirus booster jab this week as infection levels climb close to record highs.
