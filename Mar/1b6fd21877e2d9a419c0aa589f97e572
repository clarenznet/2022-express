Award-winning singer Halsey has put on a jaw-dropping display in a barely-there outfit as she attended the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles last night. The star, 27, took to the red carpet where she dazzled alongside a whole host of other celebrities, including Avril Lavigne, Mod Sun, Heidi Klum and John Legend, among others. The You Should Be Sad hitmaker donned a stunning Andres Sarda ensemble, which left very little to the imagination. Posing professionally for snaps, Halsey stunned in the bejewelled garment that only just managed to protect their modesty and showed off their intricate collection of tattoos over their arms and torso. The star donned the cut-out top that looked as if it had been sculpted to fit her petite frame, as it hugged her curves in all the right places. The diamante corset clung to her hips tightly, before snaking up her torso, over her chest and down her shoulders.

However, the bottom of the outfit proved to be just as interesting as the top thanks to the extreme flared design and slit detailing up to the star's knees. Halsey kept her trademark flawless make-up look, which they paired with a striking blue eyeliner and a slicked back ponytail. The Without Me singer wore a tiny pair of earrings and sophisticated black stilettos to complete their look.
