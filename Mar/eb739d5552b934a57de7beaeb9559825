The news come a day after Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor for Russia’s state-run Channel One, crashed the live news broadcast to protest against the war in Ukraine. The woman held a sign that said: “No war - Don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here”, risking her freedom. Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday, where she was issued a fine for inciting people to participate in the anti-war protests in Moscow, in a video she previously posted on social media. Speaking to journalists as she exited the court, she said she was “ashamed” to have worked for the Kremlin. A correspondent of the Russian state television Channel One has confirmed her resignation and said: “I think the reason is obvious”. Zhanna Agalakova told the Latvia-based news website Meduza that she handed her resignation to the management on March 3. She added: "My freedom will come from Friday (March 18). I'm waiting for this moment."
