Players are given just six chances to correctly guess a five-letter word. To figure it out as quickly as possible, you need to pay attention to the colour of the tiles. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. You can share your score on social media for bragging rights, while the app keeps track of your statistics. Indeed, if you've been a fan since the early days of Wordle, chances are you've built up quite the winning streak.
