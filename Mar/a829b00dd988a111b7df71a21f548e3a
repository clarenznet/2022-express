The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge landed in Belize during the afternoon, local time, for the start of the eight-day trip. They will also travel to Jamaica and the Bahamas - all countries where the Queen is head of state. Belize's governor general Froyla Tzalam welcomed the couple as they left the Voyager ministerial jet. The Duchess looked typically elegant in a blue dress, with heels and a clutch bag in a matching shade. The mother-of-three wore her glossy brunette hair in a chic half-up half-down do. After touching down in the country, William and Kate headed to Belize City for an official meeting with Prime Minister Johnny Briceno. During their time in Belize, the couple will visit stunning historical sites. Other highlights of the Caribbean tour will see William and Kate renew their friendly sporting rivalry when they take to the waters for a sailing regatta in the Bahamas. In Jamaica, the Cambridges are due to celebrate the island's musical and sporting heritage amid speculation Usain Bolt may be involved
