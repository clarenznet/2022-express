Meanwhile, Verstappen's team-mate Sergio Perez ranks second, and Aston Martin duo Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll also make the top 10. Teams and drivers must stick to plenty rules and regulations in the world of F1 for both safety and fairness reasons. But drivers accidentally or purposely don't adhere to them from time to time. And considering they compete in one of the world's most expensive sports, the punishments are just as gut-wrenching. Money.co.uk has collected data between the 2011 and 2021 seasons to discover which drivers cost their teams the most money by receiving fines. And despite only racing until 2015, Pastor Maldonado has racked up the most extortionate fine bill worth a staggering £110,200 from three separate offences. Kimi Raikkonen has been the most notorious offender across the last decade, receiving fines on 11 different occasions. However, his 349 race starts, significantly more than any other name on the list, meaning he averaged 32 races per offence. On the contrary, Felipe Massa was most likely to commit an offence in the cockpit, averaging one every eight races.
