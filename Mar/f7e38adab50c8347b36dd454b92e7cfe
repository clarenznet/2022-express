Chay Bowskill, 20, snatched Angel Lynn, then 19, off the street in September 2020. She suffered severe brain injuries after falling from the van and is still receiving round-the-clock care in a rehabilitation centre.  Bowskill's sentence has now been increased from seven-and-a-half years to 12 years after a Court of Appeal hearing yesterday. The Solicitor General argued a sentencing judge had not adequately taken into account the serious injuries Miss Lynn suffered in the fall. Dame Victoria Sharp, President of the Queen's Bench Division, said Angel's kidnapping was "part of and a culmination of a pattern of serious abuse" by  Bowskill and that the original sentence "failed to reflect the seriousness" of the issue. Miss Lynn's family cheered in court as the ruling was announced. Her aunt Jackie Chamberlain said the family was "relieved" by the sentence increase.  Speaking on behalf of the family, she said: "We were told at the time not to appeal, but we felt so strongly that we should have appealed, and we did and we got what we wanted today and Chay's sentence has been increased. "We're relieved because we don't want him to walk away from prison, we want him to get what he deserves." The court heard Miss Lynn fell from the van at about 60mph on the A6 near Loughborough, Leicestershire. Bowskill's accomplice Rocco Sansome, also 20, was sentenced to 21 months and this was left unchanged.   The court heard both were convicted of kidnapping after a trial at Leicester Crown Court in January. Bowskill was also convicted of coercive and controlling behaviour in a relationship and perverting the course of justice after trying to convince his mother to withdraw a statement. He was cleared of causing grievous bodily harm. Sansome admitted driving under the influence of drugs at an earlier hearing.
