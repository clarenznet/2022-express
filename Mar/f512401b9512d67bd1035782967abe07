Zoe Kravitz, 33, stunned on the red carpet in a black plunging gown. The star's racy dress laced-up at the front and clung tightly to her curves. Zoe's lace dress joined together with the star's chest covered with cat shaped faces. She wore her black tresses in a tight small bun, while her bangs were jelled to a curl on her forehead. In order to not take attention away from the dress, Zoe went for a subtle smokey eye makeup look and a nude lip. She styled the outfit with stud diamond earrings and clear sharp acrylic nails. Her dress is a custom made gown by Oscar de la Renta, in homage to a Helmut Lang car ear corset from the 1980s. Her co-star Robert Pattinson meanwhile hit the red carpet in a black ensemble and trench coat. The Twilight star layered the outerwear over a dress shirt, trousers, and a silk tie. He finished off the look with a pair of black leather dress shoes.
