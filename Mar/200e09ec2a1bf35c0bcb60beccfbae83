Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto has insisted that the revolutionary sidepod design of Mercedes' all-new W13 challenger is highly unlikely to be in breach of this year's technical regulations. The Silver Arrows turned plenty of heads when they arrived at Thursday's pre-season test in Bahrain with a highly developed version of the car that was used in last month's three-day shakedown at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. The sidepods of the W13 are now virtually non-existent in an unprecedented innovation that has raised no shortage of eyebrows across the paddock.The new design, which makes it look very different to the cars of their rivals, helps to optimise airflow and ultimately increase its straight-line speed.It was a major talking point on Thursday as Lewis Hamilton took to the track in the morning before George Russell got behind the wheel for the afternoon session.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner was said to have been left frustrated by Mercedes' new development and was quoted by various outlets as having questioned its legality during the early stages of the day's running.He later denied having done so when quizzed on the matter by Sky Sports F1 before Binotto offered his thoughts on the situation by insisting that he sees no evidence of any wrongdoing at this stage. JUST IN: George Russell told how to get under Lewis Hamilton's skin "Looking at the Mercedes cars, no doubt that it’s a great car," said the Ferrari boss."That isn’t a surprise to us. It’s a great car, good concept, quite different to the one we’ve got."As Toto [Wolff] said, they had to go through a set process with the FIA. I would be surprised too if they did anything illegal."Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether any protests will be lodged over the design of the Mercedes W13 before the new season finally gets underway next weekend. Mercedes team principal Wolff was adamant that everything was perfectly legal when asked by reporters if he expects the sidepod debate to evolve into a political matter over the course of the new campaign."The process is very clear," he told a press conference on Thursday."When you go in a specific development direction with your team, having the FIA as part of scrutinising it, you're exchanging CAD data and making them part of the process."It's clear that sometimes when you come with an innovation, it creates the kind of debate that we're having here.

We have the new governance with the super majority that's needed."My opinion is that I would have preferred to stay with the old system, and if a team comes up with an innovation, possibly you can't take it off the car if it's compliant with the regulations."I think the FIA and Formula One will for sure handle that with diligence, in the spirit of the sport."We were keen in not running alone with that, but being in touch with the FIA, that's why I think it will be okay."
