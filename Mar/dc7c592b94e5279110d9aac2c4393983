Nikita Mazepin's Formula One contract at Haas has been torn up - but he will still feature in Drive to Survive when it's released later this week, with the Russian involved in some eye-catching scenes. Mazepin has recently come under fire for his father's links to Russian president Vladimir Putin and as a result will not race in 2022. Mazepin's contract had been renewed to allow him to compete in the 2022 campaign, despite coming last in the Drivers' Championship in his debut 2021 season. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine cast doubt over his future and on Saturday morning he was relieved of his duties. Earlier in the week, the FIA had announced that he would be able to race under a neutral flag despite the conflict. However Haas confirmed he would not race for them this season, much to Mazepin's surprise and anger. Mazepin will still feature in the Netflix series Drive to Survive which is released on Friday.

"F*****g hell, that's why people hate you," Steiner said. Mazepin had been giving his engineers a hard time over the team radio and was later shown to be unco-operative during a team de-brief. Steiner then took the rookie into a private room for a dressing down - all while the Netflix crew picked up the audio from outside the door. "First of all I want to tell you that we really try to help you, but you need to help me as well," Steiner said. "When you speak on the radio, do not be aggressive - you don't achieve anything. "They (the engineers) are afraid of you. You are not a p***y. I'm not saying you need to be loved. I'm just saying to be very neutral. Not being 'Oh this is f*****g s**t'. That doesn't help anyone. "If we are not united as a team then we're all going to s**t. We are getting you closer to Mick [Schumacher]. "I know that is the f*****g frustration, but there is not a magic thing for this car and I think Mick can deal with it better." Schumacher and Mazepin were team-mates throughout the entirety of the 2021 season, although the pair did not register a single point in the driver's standings all season. The highest placing from either of the duo was Schumacher's 12th-placed finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix back in August. And Haas will be hoping that Mazepin's replacement will at least get them a solitary point in the Constructors' Championship standings at some point in the new season. The new season gets underway on March 18-20 in Bahrain.
