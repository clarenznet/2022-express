The unnamed soldier, who was based near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, described Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a "s***show". In a call intercepted by Kyiv's Security Service, the soldier also blasted the onslaught on Ukraine as a "madhouse invasion".  He said: "Basically, it's a s***show here, I'll put it that way. "Even in Chechnya, there was nothing like this. "This 'special operation', damnit… with respect to homes not meant to be destroyed… it's bulls***." The soldier was also dismissive of General-Lieutenant Yakov Rezantsev, who was commanding his unit, after Mr Rezantsev told troops the invasion of Ukraine would be over quickly.  He said: "Do you know what he told us? "It's no secret to anyone that there are only a few hours until this special operation is over. "And now those hours are still going." He also added that Russian officers were dismissive of concerns from troops about the effectiveness of their body armour. He said: "And he just says, 'Son, be strong,' and then he f***s off.

The soldier also revealed Russian troops sometimes carry dead bodies with them using the military jargon 200. He said: "They couldn't even send off the 200s here. They rode with us for five days." The Russian invasion of Ukraine appears to be stalling and turning into a war of attrition.

They have also failed to destroy Ukrainian air defences, which provides cover for any serious advance. Despite the ongoing siege of Mariupol, the Kremlin is yet to capture a major Ukrainian city.
