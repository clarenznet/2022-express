While the climate was noticeably warmer in late 2021 and early in the new year, people have still needed a little extra help. The Covid pandemic left millions of people feeling increasingly vulnerable, and the cost of living crisis only exacerbated this. With costs likely to continue surging for the foreseeable future, some may still hope to find some solace in Government aid. The Government has designed cold weather payments to cover people through some of the most unforgiving conditions. Under the scheme's terms, people receive payments when the average temperature in their area plunges to 1C or below. Should this average stick for seven days, claimants can receive £25 a week, but only for up to four months.

Anyone who believes they can qualify for the payment can still apply. They can put in applications until the end of this month should temperatures plummet low enough. Those unsure as to whether they can claim the payment should check the Government's website. Anyone who successfully qualifies may have to wait a while before they see the sum in their account. The Government's website states it could take up to two weeks to process. People who continue to struggle financially with the benefit boost could also qualify for winter fuel payments. The deadline for these is also approaching at the end of this month. Winter fuel payments are slightly more generous and could see people born on or before September 26, 1955, receive between £100 and £300 to help with their bills. People receive the payment automatically if they qualify and receive State Pension or another social security benefit. The additional cash usually arrives between November and December, ahead of the coldest days. But the application period ends with cold weather payments on March 31 this year.
