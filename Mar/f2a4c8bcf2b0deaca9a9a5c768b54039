The claims, made in diplomatic cables and handed to Nato allies, have prompted Washington to threaten leader Xi Jinping with economic sanctions if he helps Vladimir Putin.

According to the US, China “indicated a willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia”. But diplomatic experts warn China getting involved could risk a Third World War. A senior US administration official said there were “deep concerns” over Beijing’s alignment with Putin.

Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said Russia had no need of Chinese assistance. He added: “Russia has its own potential to continue the operation which is unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full.” The Chinese foreign ministry also denied the reports, describing them as “disinformation”.
