In an initial interview played to jurors, Ali Harbi Ali told officers: "I mean, I guess, yeah, I killed an MP. I done it, so yeah." In a second interview, he likened his words to a script from the hit BBC comedy starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams. He told PC Jody Grogan: "Oh God, I sound stupid there. Nah, I just... the way I worded it." He chuckled and added: "It sounds like a Little Britain episode. I just... yeah, it sounded like what a terrorist act is. "I went into an MP's surgery and I killed him, so with the idea of vengeance." He confirmed it was a "terror attack" and no-one else was involved, the court heard. Yesterday, Old Bailey jurors were played video recordings of Ali, 26, following his arrest for the murder of Sir David last October. The veteran MP for Southend West was stabbed to death at Belfairs Methodist Church, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali allegedly murdered father of-five Sir David, 69, in revenge for supporting air strikes on Syria. He described the fatal blow as a "finisher" during his interview with police. He said: "It was probably on his neck over here - at his jugular because when I pierced it, dark red blood came out."  Afterwards, Ali said he had Sir David's blood on his fingernails and jacket. "That seems a bit, I don't know, satanical almost, it's weird. Obviously I've killed someone. There's no doubt about that but it still doesn't feel like it. "Maybe it's because I feel justified in what I've done. "If I didn't believe it was a good deed I wouldn't do it. "One minute I was sat down at the table talking to him and the next he was, sort of, dead. It's probably one of the strangest days of my life now, y'know?" He posed as a new constituent to trick one of Sir David's aides into giving him an appointment. Ali, from Kentish Town, north London, denies murder and preparing an act of terrorism.
