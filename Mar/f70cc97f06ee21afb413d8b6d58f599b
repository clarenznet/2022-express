The barrister and reality show host is in Poland to try to help the grandparents of Oksana Platero, his professional partner on 2016’s Strictly Come Dancing, safely cross the border. Speaking from Przemysl, southern Poland, the 43-year-old challenged the speed at which the UK Government is processing refugee applications. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain both he and his translator struggled to complete an online form required at the border from those fleeing the conflict. And he compared scenes at the railway station to his Jewish grandparents’ experience fleeing during the Second World War. Rinder said: “People should know what happened in the past or we’re doomed to repeat it. I can tell GMB viewers that it is repeating itself. “It’s hard to believe...that this is 2022. The trains arrive infrequently. When they do it is women, it is children, it is babies in mothers’ arms. “They arrive in wagons cheek to jowl, a sea of humanity with just very often one suitcase or the clothes on their back.” Rinder was made an MBE for services to Holocaust awareness last year, after exploring the stories of Jewish families in a BBC series and speaking in schools alongside survivors. Ukrainian dancer Platero confirmed that her relatives had now arrived safely in Poland.
