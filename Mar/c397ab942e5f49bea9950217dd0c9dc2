Emergency services dashed to St Andrew's Church in Plymouth, Devon, at around 9.20pm yesterday to reports of a fall. The fire service confirmed two crews spent more than five hours conducting a rescue operation and the victim was taken to hospital at around 2.50am today.  They had to use specialist equipment to free the person. Further details about the person, including their gender and age, have yet to be disclosed by the authorities. Photographs, which have since been shared widely on social media, show emergency service vehicles, including a fire engine, with blue lights on, at the church late last night. A Devon & Somerset Fire and Rescue Service statement said: "Two fire engines along with specialist fire crews attended this location to assist ambulance, following reports that a person had fallen from the bell tower sustaining injuries. "Crews used specialist equipment to lower the casualty to the ground floor and left them in the hands of ambulance for ongoing care."  Plymouth Live has contacted South West Ambulance Service and Devon and Cornwall Police for more information about the fall. St Andrews Church, which was built in the 15th century, is in the heart of Plymouth, near the Royal Parade and several shopping areas. The Anglican church is the largest parish church in Devon. It was bombed and badly damaged during the Second World War in 1941. Amid the smoking ruins a headmistress nailed over the door a wooden sign saying simply Resurgam (Latin for I shall rise again), indicating the wartime spirit, a gesture repeated at other devastated European churches. But on November 30, 1957 - St Andrew's Day - the church was re-roofed and restored.
