Speaking in Parliament, Mr Johnson said: "What we have seen already from Vladimir Putin's regime in the use of the munitions that they have already been dropping on innocent civilians, in my view, already fully qualifies as a war crime." Specifically, Mr Johnson accused Putin of "abhorrent" attacks as Ukraine's capital Kyiv braced for a siege and second city Kharkiv suffered relentless bombardment.A statement carried on the website of the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect states: “Even though the prohibition of certain behaviour in the conduct of armed conflict can be traced back many centuries, the concept of war crimes developed particularly at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, when international humanitarian law, also known as the law of armed conflict, was codified.“The Hague Conventions adopted in 1899 and 1907 focus on the prohibition to warring parties to use certain means and methods of warfare. Several other related treaties have been adopted since then.”Additionally, the Geneva Convention of 1864 and subsequent Geneva Conventions, notably the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols, focus on the protection of persons not or no longer taking part in hostilities.The statement adds: “Both Hague Law and Geneva Law identify several of the violations of its norms, though not all, as war crimes.“However there is no one single document in international law that codifies all war crimes.” What is happening where you live?
