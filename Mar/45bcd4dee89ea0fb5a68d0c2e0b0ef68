He explained that people can access this one percent via Virgin’s Money M Plus bank account. He said: “You open the Virgin Money M Plus bank account and then there’s a linked savings account that you can do this in. “Contrast that to the top standard easy access account Cynergy at 0.8 percent, this is a big best buy. “Crucially, you don’t need to switch banks to do it, you just open the Virgin Money bank account, get a quid in there then you have access to the linked savings. “If you did want to use their switching service it will give you a £100 experience voucher if you do it.

The rate will rise from 0.35 percent to one percent on balances up to £25,000. For balances above £25,000, the rate will rise to 0.5 percent. This means a Virgin current account customer with £25,000 stashed away in the linked saver account will earn £250 in interest over the course of one year. It beats the best buy in our independent best buy easy-access tables, with Atom Bank this week launching a 0.75 percent rate. Hugh Chater, chief commercial officer at Virgin Money, said: “Following the Bank of England base rate increase, we want to reward our customers for saving with us and give UK consumers more reasons to bank with Virgin Money. “We recognise the importance of supporting our customers in these challenging financial times, and by boosting our linked savings rates we can give customers better value for their savings.” For anyone with a large sum of cash sitting in their current account earning little or no interest, Virgin Money's offer may be tempting. Those switching to its Money M Plus Account will also benefit from a £100 Virgin Experience Day gift card, as well as interest of 2.02 percent on current account balances up to £1,000. Currently switched can benefit from 5.02 percent on balances up to £1,000 thanks to a three percent bonus rate fixed for 12 months - a £50 return. In terms of the interest on offer, no bank gets close to Virgin Money. Nationwide offer two percent interest up to £1,500 to its FlexDirect customers. Lloyds Bank pays 0.6 percent on balances up to £4,000, and 1.5 percent on £4,000 - £5,000. Santander pays 0.3 percent on balances up to £20,000 on its 123 current account.
