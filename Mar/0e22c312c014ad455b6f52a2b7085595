The 14-year-old boy was detained at an address in Hinckley, Leicestershire, nearly 10 miles from where the incident is alleged to have taken place in Bedworth, Warwickshire between 6.45pm and 7.15pm on Saturday in a residential area near the town centre. Warwickshire Police say the girl had been sitting with a group on the grass at a junction of two residential roads moments before the attack. The suspect is now due to be questioned, reports Coventry Live. A spokesman for the police force said: "We can confirm a 14-year-old boy from Hinckley has been arrested on suspicion of rape in connection with the incident. He remains in police custody at this time." The street in Bedworth has been taped off today as officers continue to probe the sex attack. The victim continues to receive support from specially trained officers. Patrols have also increased locally. "We understand this incident is likely to cause concern among the local community but we would like to reassure them a full and thorough investigation has begun," Detective Inspector Collette O'Keefe at Warwickshire Police said. "We are carrying out extensive enquiries and pursuing a number of lines of enquiry as part of our ongoing work. "Specially trained officers are providing support to the victim at this time and we have cordoned off an area at the bottom of Walter Scott Road where it meets the junction of Coalpit Fields Road as we conduct initial enquiries. "There will be an increased police presence in the area over the coming days while we look to establish exactly what happened."
