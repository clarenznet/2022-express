Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev was named as the Russian commander who personally issued a demand for troops defending the port to surrender, which they bravely rejected. His savage attacks include the bombing of a maternity hospital that killed a heavily pregnant woman and her unborn child, and a theatre where hundreds of children were then buried alive. Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former Austrian ambassador, joined with Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of Ukraine's Centre for Civil Liberties, to demand he face war crimes charges. He is feared to have led Russia's military strategy in Syria. Scherba shared an audio clip that apparently captures the general berating a junior officer for not wearing his uniform properly, saying: "Why is his face not mutilated yet? Why hasn't anyone cut off his ears?" Meanwhile, a teenager has watched his mother burn "while still alive" after driving over a landmine in the latest Russian atrocity. Andriy, 15, who was injured and cannot walk, said his family were forced from their Chernihiv home at gunpoint for deportation.
