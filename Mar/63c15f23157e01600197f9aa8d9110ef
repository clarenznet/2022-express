Two people died at a branch of the fast-food restaurant chain in the northeastern city of Zwolle around 6pm local time after a man, according to witnesses, opened fire on them. As per witness reports published by the Dutch rtv oost, the alleged gunman walked into the venue and ordered some food before sitting down at a table and shooting the guests sitting next to him on Wednesday, March 30. The identity of the victims, who were said to be of a Turkish-Dutch background, is not yet known. Officers inspected the area in bulletproof vests and a police helicopter circled above the area. An air ambulance was also called in but was cancelled shortly afterwards. A McDonald's spokesman called it a "terrible event". They added: "We sympathise with the relatives of the possible victim and offer aftercare to our team. "It made a very deep impression." Police said in a statement on Twitter: "We are investigating in Zwolle and are looking for the perpetrator (s) of the shooting incident. "If you see anything suspicious, call 112 immediately and do not take any action yourself!" A second post by police added: "Two people were killed in the shooting earlier this evening. "The area surrounding the McDonald's in Zwolle-Noord has been closed as a crime scene for investigation. "Have you seen anything but haven't spoken to the police yet? Call 0900-8844." Mayor Peter Snijders of Zwolle said the event has had "a lot of impact on the employees and the visitors present". He told NOS: "My thoughts are with all those affected and the relatives of the victims and with everyone who was an unsolicited eyewitness."
