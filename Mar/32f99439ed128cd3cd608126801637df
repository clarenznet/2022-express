Her Majesty has met Putin a number of times since he first became Russian President in 1999. However, perhaps the most eventful was Putin’s state visit to the UK in 2003 after the Russian President made Buckingham Palace nervous by keeping the Queen waiting for 14 minutes.  It was in fact a dog which gave the first warning signs as it reacted negatively to the Russian leader. This allegedly led the Queen to break protocol where she then took a brutal swipe at Putin. David Blunkett, who was Home Secretary at the time, told the BBC that his dog reacted defensively towards Putin. He said: “The only time I met Vladimir Putin was back in 2003 on an official visit and my then dog barked very loudly.  “I did apologise to the Queen who was obviously hosting. “I don’t think I am giving anything away when I said, ‘Sorry your Majesty about the dog barking. “She said, 'Dogs have interesting instincts, don’t they?’” According to The Mirror this remark would break protocol as The Queen must be “strictly neutral with respect to political matters”.

This was only months after Prince Charles had allegedly compared Putin’s rule to the Nazi regime. The Queen was helped down some steps by then US President Barack Obama and New Zealand's Governor-General Jerry Mateparae. However, Putin who was nearby, did not offer to help the elderly monarch.
