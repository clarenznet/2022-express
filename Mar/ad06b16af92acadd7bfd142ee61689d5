Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other big names in the Tory party will attend the Spring Conference, starting Friday, March 18. This year, the key event is being hosted at Blackpool Winter Gardens in Lancashire. It is the first major political event to take place in Blackpool since 2007. Mr Johnson will give his keynote speech at the end of the conference on Saturday. Over the next two days, other speakers on the agenda include Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday, and ministers Grant Shapps, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Priti Patel. This conference is different from the annual Tory party conference, which will take place in Birmingham later this year.
