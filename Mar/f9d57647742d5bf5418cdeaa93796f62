Prince William, 39, and Kate, 40, will leave on their Platinum Jubilee trip on Saturday. It comes months after Barbados's historic move to sever ties with the monarchy. Speaking days after the ceremony last November, Jamaica's prime minister Andrew Holness said: "There is no question that Jamaica has to become a republic." The royals, whose Caribbean tour also includes Belize and the Bahamas, could meet with Holness, 49, alongside engagements "celebrating Bob Marley" and seeing the Jamaica Defence Force in action. Experts said the success of their tour may determine whether they will reign as king and queen of Jamaica, which gained independence from Britain in 1962. An online petition calling for the postponement of the Cambridges' visit received only 817 signatures. Professor Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, said: "Jamaica is the one to watch." "The political will is strong and the issue of reparations for colonialism and slavery adds moral weight to the republican cause." Referring to the trip, a royal source said: "The focus is on the Platinum Jubilee and the purpose of the tour is to thank the people of each country for the support they have shown the Queen." Her Majesty was said to feel "sadness" at the departure of Barbados, in a ceremony which was watched by the Prince of Wales.
