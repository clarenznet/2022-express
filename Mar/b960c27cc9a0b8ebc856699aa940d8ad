Lewis Hamilton did not appear to be completely happy with the performance of the Mercedes W13 during Thursday's pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit. The 37-year-old was tasked with putting the all-new Silver Arrows challenger through its paces in the morning session in advance of the upcoming season, which is set to get underway at the same circuit next weekend. Mercedes turned plenty of heads when they arrived in Bahrain with a vastly different car to the one that was used in last month's three-day shakedown at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.The biggest changes were made to the sidepods, which are now virtually non-existent in an unprecedented innovation that has raised no shortage of eyebrows across the paddock.The redesign was said to have been highly successful based on simulator tests, with some reports claiming that Mercedes' W13 may now be a whole second per lap quicker as a result of the alterations.However, it seems as though Hamilton is adamant that further improvements will need to be made before the five red lights go out in Bahrain next week.The Brit complained of understeer at the end of his first run of the morning session, according to Auto Motor und Sport. JUST IN: Christian Horner's briefing to Red Bull - 'Wipe smile off Toto's face' It is said that Mercedes also felt the updated car was 'too nervous' and have since been working to improve the setup in order to ease Hamilton's worries.The Silver Arrows also continued to struggle with the 'porpoising' issue that has been causing problems for a number of teams since the first day of testing in Barcelona.It results in cars bouncing up and down on long straights and is a by-product of the ground effect that generates a significant percentage of downforce on the new 2022 cars.It remains to be seen whether Mercedes will be able to iron out their lingering issues before the competitive action begins in just over a week's time. Meanwhile, it has been reported that a handful of teams have been left concerned by the German outfit's unique approach to the new technical regulations.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner is said to be particularly aggrieved by the changes and was quoted by numerous outlets as having questioned the legality of the revamped W13 ahead of Thursday's session.However, the Austrian team quickly moved to deny that Horner had done so with a statement which read: "Horner has not given any interviews regarding Mercedes' car."Any quotes attributed to him this morning are incorrect."
