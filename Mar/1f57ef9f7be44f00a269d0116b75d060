If you've been hoping to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 in 2022, then chances are you haven't had much luck. After regular stock drops in the run up to Christmas, PS5 consoles have been in short supply in the months following. Fortunately, however, it looks like the shortages are coming to an end, at least according to the PS5 Stock UK account. The site claims that the Christmas stock boost - where consoles were delivered in bulk by air - has led to the current stock shortages. These setbacks are coming to an end, meaning we should see bigger and more frequent stock in the coming months. "Last Christmas' shipment boost causing longer patches for Q1 2022 with PS5 restocks should slowly overturn this April onward," reads a PS5 Stock UK tweet. The site adds that the first of these increased stock drops should take place in April, so expect restocks from next week onwards. "We can expect a few large drops this month." The stock drops couldn't have come at a better time, following a strong few months for new releases. Recommended games include PlayStation exclusives Horizon Forbidden West and Gran Turismo 7, as well as third-party hits such as Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a personal favourite, featuring a huge open-world that's brimming with interesting things to do. "A vast world where open fields with a variety of situations and huge dungeons with complex and three-dimensional designs are seamlessly connected. "As you explore, the joy of discovering unknown and overwhelming threats await you, leading to a high sense of accomplishment. "In addition to customizing the appearance of your character, you can freely combine the weapons, armor, and magic that you equip. You can develop your character according to your play style, such as increasing your muscle strength to become a strong warrior, or mastering magic."
