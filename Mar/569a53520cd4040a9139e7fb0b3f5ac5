The Foreign Secretary also said Moscow would have to give guarantees there would be no further acts of aggression towards its neighbour. She told the Sunday Telegraph: "There need to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever. Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. "And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used.” It comes as Dmitry Medvedev, a close Putin ally, appeared to contradict his own generals about Russia's military aims in Ukraine. The deputy head of the Russian Security Council reiterated that Moscow's key war aim was to "de-nazify" Ukraine - the Kremlin's code for regime change.
