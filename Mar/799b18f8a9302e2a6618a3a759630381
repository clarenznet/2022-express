IHG hotels include InterContinental, Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and more. The hotel chain has just announced a brand new offer that’s perfect for all family holidays. IHG has launched the new Grandparents Stay For Free offer, which is inspired by two years lost of family moments because of the pandemic. According to IHG research, 52 percent of grandparents agree that making new memories with the extended family is a key priority for 2022. Available now, guests can book two rooms for two nights and get the cheapest room free on check-in. The offer is valid at select IHG hotels across the UK, Ireland, France and Germany including Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and more. To redeem the offer, book hotels directly here. The offer is available to book from now until 20 April 2022 and is valid on stays from 6 April - 15 July 2021. It’s the perfect opportunity to book a family holiday for Easter or summer getaway. Please note, bookings must be made seven days before check-in date. Bookings must be made under the same family name for two rooms in the same hotel. When booking, guests will see a charge on the second room but the hotel will reduce the cheapest room charge to zero on check-in. This deal is only valid on room only bookings with a maximum of two rooms per booking. View T&Cs here. Karin Sheppard, Managing Director at IHG Hotels & Resorts in Europe, said: “We value the importance of family time and helping our guests to reconnect - that is why we created our Grandparents Stay for Free offer, hopefully making coming together hassle free and enabling these families to focus on spending quality time together again.” According to research conducted by IHG, a third of grandparents felt the loss of not receiving hugs and a fifth of all those surveyed missed making each other laugh.
