Ex-Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski spoke out about the risk the West may be taking in arming Ukrainians as Vladimir Putin could see this as a threat. Putin has been waging war on neighbouring Ukraine claiming his "special operation" is aimed at "denazifying" the country. The ex-Foreign Minister explained that the risk was worth it as he suspects that if Ukraine loses to Russia, repercussions, and consequences for Poland and other NATO countries.
