The West Ham owners have been told how they can convince Declan Rice to stay at the club long term. Rice is being linked with a mega-money move away from the Hammers, with Manchester United long-term admirers of the England international. The midfielder has rejected offers of a new contract at the London Stadium. His current deal expires in 2024 and West Ham are keen to tie him down. The east London club currently sit sixth in the Premier League table and still harbour hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. They are in the last-16 of the Europa League, where they face Sevilla at home this evening trailing 1-0 from the first leg. Former Hammers winger Trevor Sinclair has spoken out on the future of Rice ahead of the match. Sinclair says there are two ways the club can ensure Rice stays for the long term.

Chelsea have also been linked with a move for Rice but the sanctions imposed on owner Roman Abramovich makes a deal seem unlikely this summer. Former Arsenal star Paul Merson claimed in February that he expects Rice to leave at the end of this season, with United his likely destination. "I think Declan Rice will be gone this summer," Merson told Sky Sports. "I think it will be Man Utd, if you're Man Utd you've got to break the bank.  "If you look at their midfield it is not strong enough, they don't dominate football matches and for me, they have to go and get him. I think he is the best in the business, he has improved immensely, he has taken his game up not one or two, I think he has taken it up ten-fold.
