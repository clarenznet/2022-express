Dorset Police is on the hunt to track down the 32-year-old man named Kyle Darren Eglington. The police have made an appeal for any citizen that may see the man to urgently contact 999. Police began searching for the man after they were informed at 11.13am on Saturday morning about his run-off. Eglington was held in custody after being charged with robbery, following an incident in Verney Close in Bournemouth on Thursday, March 24. The man appeared at Poole Magistrates’ Court the next day, and on Saturday, he managed to escape while he was in a court prisoner transport vehicle. When the van was on Hardy Road in Poole, Eglington assaulted one of the security officers and ran off, wearing nothing but his underwear and socks. Officers carried out a search of the area, with help from a police helicopter and the British Transport Police, but without any results. Eglington was described as white, five feet eleven inches tall and of medium build, with dark brown hair and a beard. The police, however, say that he has now probably changed his appearance, by shaving his head and beard. It was reported that he may have been in the West Howe area of Bournemouth in the early hours of Sunday. Chief Inspector Neil Wright, of Dorset Police, said: “I would like to reassure members of the public that we have a number of officers carrying out searches and other enquiries in a bid to locate Kyle Eglington as soon as possible and return him to lawful custody.”
