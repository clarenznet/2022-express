The pile-up happened on the southbound carriageway at around 6am near junction 6 - Spaghetti Junction - for the A38(M) in Birmingham. Queues were back to junction 10 for Wolverhampton, West Midlands and are still several miles long. Travel time on the southbound stretch is approximately 20 minutes longer than usual at this stage. There are also delays on the northbound carriageway as motorists slow down to look, according to travel monitoring system Inrix. Six vehicles, including at least one HGV, were involved in the shunt. Debris, including spilled milk, is on the road, Birmingham Live reports. A West Midlands Ambulance Service statement said: "Upon arrival crews found three patients. “The first, a man who was the driver of a van. He was assessed and had sustained potentially serious injuries that were not believed to be life threatening. He received treatment from ambulance staff at the scene. “The second, a man who was the driver of one of the cars. He had sustained potentially serious injuries that were not believed to be life threatening. He received treatment on scene. “Both men were conveyed to Heartlands Hospital for further treatment. “A third patient was assessed by ambulance staff, they received self care advice and were discharged at the scene. “No further patients required treatment.”  Spaghetti Junction - or the Gravelly Hill Interchange as it's actually called - opened in May 1972 to help navigate the M6, the A38(M), the A38 and local roads in north Birmingham. Problems are exasperated there because part of the M6 was closed overnight for roadworks. It is hoped that a £78 million project will transform a junction for Walsall, West Midlands and improve the traffic situation in the area. A series of bridges along the M6 will get demolished as part of this work. Highways England outlined its plans earlier this week on its social media.
