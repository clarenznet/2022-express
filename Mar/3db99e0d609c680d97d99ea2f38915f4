TalkTalk has launched a new set-top box, dubbed TalkTalk TV 4K Box, for new and existing customers with its fibre broadband plans. The 4K TV Box arrives with access to 70 terrestrial channels as well as 30 on-demand services and streaming apps, including the likes of Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube. Connected via Wi-Fi, the box can be used to pause, rewind and record live television ...but you'll need to connect an external hard-drive to store all of the footage as there's no built-in storage. The TalkTalk TV 4K Box ships with a remote with voice control capabilities, so you can search for your favourite shows, movies and apps with a quick voice command. TalkTalk is relying on Amazon's chatty AI assistant Alexa to power this functionality, so those who already have an Amazon Echo smart speaker or two, you'll be immediately familiar with how this voice-activated helper works. Searching with Alexa will hunt across all streaming services. Just like the latest hardware from Sky and Virgin Media, TalkTalk TV 4K Box supports shows and movies in 4K Ultra High Definition. Some streaming services, like Prime Video and Disney+, include support for 4K Ultra HD as standard as long as your set-top box supports the format. However, Netflix locks this ultra-crisp picture quality behind its priciest subscription tier, dubbed Netflix Premium, which costs £15.99 a month – almost £10 more than the Basic plan (£6.99). TalkTalk TV 4K Box is also the first set-top box that supports TikTok. Until now, the only way to watch your favourite TikTok clips on the big screen was using a Samsung-branded Smart TV. But with the arrival of the TalkTalk TV 4K Box, that all changes. The latest set-top box is designed by Netgem, which works with a number of other broadband providers in the UK to bring on-demand content and live television to broadband plans. Speaking about the launch of the TalkTalk TV 4K Box, Managing Director Of TalkTalk Consumer and Direct Business, Jonathan Kini said: “Our priority is to ensure we provide the best entertainment and fibre packages on the market, at great value. That’s why we’re delighted to partner with Netgem to release the TalkTalk TV 4K Box – bringing next level entertainment to our customers and easy access to TikTok, Netflix and Prime Video.” For those who already subscribe to TalkTalk and want a set-top box with access to Freeview channels, support for Ultra HD streaming, and a wide range of popular streaming services and apps... this isn't a bad option. At £4 a month extra for Fibre 65 customers, it's pretty affordable. However, there are other options on the market. For example, Amazon's critically-acclaimed Fire TV range has access to more streaming services, games, and apps – and can be bought with a one-off payment. Of course, you'll need to rely on apps like BBC iPlayer and ITV hub to watch live channels, and there's no ability to record boxsets. However, with the wide range of on-demand shows and films available at a tap... and with prices for the Fire TV range starting from just £29.99, it could be a much more affordable option. Likewise, Roku offers a number of brilliant set-top boxes with access to the most popular streaming services, including BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All4, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and more, as well as its own exclusive Roku Channel, which is home to boxsets and movies for free.
