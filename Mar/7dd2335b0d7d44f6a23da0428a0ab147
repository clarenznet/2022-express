It means people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying any income tax or National Insurance. The Chancellor said it will benefit 30 million Britons and not just those who are earning below the threshold. There was some good news to come out of this week’s Spring Statement. Despite the fact that the Government is pressing ahead with its National Insurance increase of 1.25 percent, it also announced it was raising the threshold at which National Insurance has to be paid. On Twitter, Mr Sunak said: “From July, people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying any income tax or National Insurance. ""It’s a £6billion personal tax cut for 30 million people in the UK."

Commentators welcomed the move which will also see people who earn above the threshold better off. Laura Suter, the head of personal finance at AJ Bell, said: "The Chancellor went one step further than the leaked plans and extended the National Insurance threshold to £12,570, meaning that anyone earning below this limit will pay no income tax and no National Insurance. "By bringing in the move in July, rather than immediately, taxpayers won’t get a full year of the benefit."

Ms Suter explained: "The Government says that 70 percent of people currently paying National Insurance will see a reduction in their bill, even with pushing ahead with the increased 1.25 percent levy.” Despite this, taxpayers will still see their National Insurance contributions rise by 1.25 percentage points in April. It will mean National Insurance will hit 13.25 percent for people earning between £184 and £967 a week from April. Britons who have reached state pension age will also be expected to pay the 1.25 percent Health and Social Care Levy if they earn more than £184 a week. It has left campaigners worried about how people, especially pensioners, will manage to make ends meet. Many people are already struggling to pay higher energy bills and food prices during the cost of living crisis. The Government says the increase is necessary in order to raise £12billion to fund social care and the NHS. What is happening where you live?
