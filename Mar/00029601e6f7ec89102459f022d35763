Ukrainians in the UK aims to support people from Ukraine who are in the UK. Once you and your family arrive in Britain, there is a lot to do - from finding housing, making sure you have access to healthcare and education, and getting support and financial help. The UK Government's advice reads: "In England, Scotland and Wales, you can get free onward travel by train, bus, coach or light rail from the major airport or port you arrive at. To be eligible, you must travel within 48 hours of arriving in the UK. "You may be able to claim certain benefits immediately, including Universal Credit. You can do this using the stamp in your passport. If you do not have a passport, you can use your BRP or Home Office document. "If you’re applying for Universal Credit you’ll get a National Insurance number if your claim is successful. "If you plan to work or claim other benefits, you can apply for a National Insurance number yourself." You can also get help from charities in the UK, such as the Red Cross, which offers advice on how to set up your life in Britain. You can find a list of other charities to support you during your first weeks in Britain with our full list, or let us know what additional support you might require.
