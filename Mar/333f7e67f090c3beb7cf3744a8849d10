Foo Fighters have come together for their first move, the horror-comedy flick Studio 666. It recounts how the band wrote their 2021 hit album Medicine at Midnight, though with a more supernatural twist than fans might have believed. Despite lead singer and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl being busy shooting the movie, he found time outside of production to collaborate with another major musician on their latest release, Everything’s Electric. That musician is, of course, Liam Gallagher, the former Oasis frontman that has since been finding continued and immense success through his solo career. In February 2022, he released Everything’s Electric, the first single from his album C’MON YOU KNOW which is set to debut on May 27 and features a few notable cameos. Dave Grohl is by far the biggest and most unexpected addition. The pair co-wrote the song together, and Grohl even returned to the drums to perform on the single. In a new interview with NME, the star revealed the origins of the track and how the two legends got together.

It’s like putting a f*****g quarter in a jukebox and just turning it up with that guy. It’s f*****g great. Obviously, he’s an amazing singer and he’s a f*****g rock star. He is one of the few last remaining rock stars.” It appears the collaboration only happened later in the writing of the track, as Gallagher was already well underway with it with producer Greg Kurstin. Grohl was a natural pick to help create the beat, as the two had performed together in the past. Oasis and Foo Fighters last toured together back in 2008 and there have been rumours of a collaboration between Grohl and the Gallagher brother ever since. The Foo Fighters singer added: “He was making a song [Everything’s Electric] with the producer Greg Kurstin and they needed a beat which I think was described as something Sabotage-esque [Beastie Boys] and so I f*****g served it up. I served up the beats. And the f*****g single turned out great. I love that song I honestly do. I was dancing to it the other night.” Grohl’s love for Gallagher is apparent but in a previous interview with GQ Magazine, the Oasis singer took issue with the Foo Fighters frontman. The 49-year-old joked: “He ruined it for all of us. “He broke his leg and still toured. Who does that? “Now if I have a cold I can’t cancel because I’ll look like a wuss. “He asked me to come on and do a song [during Foo Fighters recent Glastonbury appearance]. I said no, cos I need a bit of rehearsal. I know it’s cool and all that, but I need a rehearsal.” DON'T MISS...Dave Grohl ‘didn’t want’ to be drummer after Kurt Cobain death [INSIGHT]The Storyteller: David Grohl's honest and unflinching memoir [EXPLAINER]Dave Grohl health: The Foo Fighters singer collapsed [INSIGHT] It isn’t clear if this is a sign of a bigger collaboration to come, though if something is brewing, it is unlikely to be this year. Foo Fighters are touring in the USA and are set to gig across the UK later this year. For fans looking to get their Foo on, the movie is the quickest way to get a hit. Studio 666 is a love letter to the musical mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap and harkens back to cult-favourites such as Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. Despite Gallagher not making an appearance, there are cameos from Lionel Richie, Slayer guitarist Kerry King and director of Halloween and The Thing, John Carpenter. Studio 666 is available to watch in cinemas now SOURCE
