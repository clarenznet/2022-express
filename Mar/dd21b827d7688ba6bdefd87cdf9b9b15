Buckingham Palace declined to give details about her “private” gift to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. But it comes as aid groups, including Save the Children UK and the Red Cross, appealed for funds to help refugees desperate for food, water and medical assistance. The Daily Express is backing the DEC appeal. Every pound donated will be matched by the Government, up to £20million. Saleh Saeed, chief executive of DEC, said: “Most of the people fleeing are women and children, forced to abandon their homes and loved ones, to find sanctuary in neighbouring countries.”  Mr Saeed said the crisis was “horrific and heartbreaking”, but added: “There’s something we can all do to bring hope. Please donate and help us raise funds and support hundreds of thousands of people who are already fleeing.” More than one million people have already fled Ukraine, but experts expect four million will eventually be displaced.
