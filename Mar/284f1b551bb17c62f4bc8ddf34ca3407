Clair Ablewhite, 47, suffered multiple knife wounds in an attack at her home. A man, 48, was arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released under investigation. Ms Ablewhite's heartbroken son Sam posted a favourite photo of his smiling mother on social media and wrote: "RIP mum, we all miss you so much." "You really were one in a million. Words cannot describe how hard my life will be without seeing that beautiful big smile you had. Rest in peace, sleep tight and remember all the good times we had together." "All three of us brothers will do everything we can to put a proud little smile on your face up there." His brother Dan added: "I love you so much mum. I just want to see that big smile and give you a hug and tell you how much you mean to us all. You really were one in a million." Mother-of-three Ms Ablewhite was found dead at her home in Colston Bassett, Notts, on Saturday. Police believe she was attacked on Friday night or the early hours of Saturday. The suspect was arrested on Sunday morning. Residents of the village - described as one of the "poshest" in Britain - have been left stunned by the tragedy. Detective Inspector Mel Crutchley said: "I understand that in a quiet, close-knit community like this it is shocking for an incident like this to happen and people will be talking." "But I would urge people not to speculate. Please trust the judicial process to find the truth."
