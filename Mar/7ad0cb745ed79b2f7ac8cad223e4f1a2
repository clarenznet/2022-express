In the latest crackdown on freedom of expression by the Russian state, it is moving to ban use of Instagram. Putin also wants Meta, the parent company behind Instagram and Facebook, to be branded an "extremist organisation". Polina Ivanova, the FT's correspondent covering Russia and Ukraine, said of the decision: "It’s huge because this is really a much loved platform in Russia and also the source of income for lots of small businesses across the country. "And for young Moscow elites it’s.. everything." Max Seddon, the FT's Moscow bureau chief, added: "Even in the context of wartime repression, this is astonishing – it basically likens Facebook to al-Qaeda." This follows the blocking of Facebook and Twitter in the country as Russia stamps down on information coming from anywhere other than within the state. There were initially reports that WhatsApp, another of Meta's applications, would also be blocked by the state - but this was later refuted when a source told state-owned agency RIA Novosti that the conversation technology "will not be affected by measures against Meta, since it is a means of communication not posting information.” The new restrictions come shortly after Meta announced that it would be breaking with existing policy and allowing users to call for the death of Russians. Internal emails seen by Reuters revealed Meta's decision yesterday. They are also allowing some posts that call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to internal emails to its content moderators. A spokesperson for Meta said: "As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders. We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians."
