In its daily defence intelligence update, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said Russia is increasingly seeking to generate additional troops to bolster its personnel losses. To which political journalist Andrew Neil replied: "Very important update. The Russian offensive is in real trouble."

The update continued: "As a result of these losses it is likely Russia is struggling to conduct offensive operations in the face of sustained Ukrainian resistance.
