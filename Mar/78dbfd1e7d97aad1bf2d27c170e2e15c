This came after a source told the Sun: “Obviously they’d be a huge coup this year, and could use their appearance to make an impassioned speech of their choosing, most likely Ukraine. Show producers Will Packer and Shayla Cowan have lined up some amazing A-list names to take to the stage and Harry and Meghan would be the icing on the cake.” Responding to the claims on Twitter, one user Linda Lavigne wrote: "If they present an award I’m done with the Oscars!" A second user, Philip, agreed, writing: "Oscars credibility down the toilet. "Will suggest a 'red button' and an audience, sponsorship and advertising crash. "Any product advertised and/or company sponsorship of the Oscars to be boycotted." Meanwhile, Melissa Gregoire wrote: "I will really be disappointed if these two are presenters at the Academy Awards. "Why? Because they will see it as a sign that they have been truly embraced by A-listers. "Their most favourite people who espouse their ideals, & who will finally allow them into their intimate circles." Ginger Jones added: "I don’t believe this for a second. "Previous presenters have been Rita Moreno, Jame Fonda, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Michelle Obama, Sean Connery, Sidney Poitier, Al Pacino. No way are they in the same league."
