Everton and Boreham Wood's fifth-round FA Cup tie was called to a halt with 40 minutes on the clock after the players alerted the referee to a medical emergency in the crowd. It's an all too familiar sight at football matches this season following a string of concerning high-profile incidents.Â However, on this occasion, there was seemingly good news at Goodison Park... Just five minutes from the interval, both sets of players could be heard shouting to get the attention of the officials and medical staff on the far side. Below the gantry, there appeared to be a distressing scene unfolding as Everton's medical staff sprinted across the pitch to be of assistance. But just a few minutes later, the game was given the green light to continue, which immediately seemed like positive news. Commentator Clive Tyldesley then issued a small update, confirming the affected supporter was able to walk away from the scene.

Salomon Rondon marked a rare start with a brace as he opened the scoring by prodding home at the near post from Jonjo Kenny's low cross. The Venezuelan target man then added a second when he nodded him Andros Townsend's cross at the back post. Lampard's men will now face a trip to Selhurst Park for a place in the semi-finals at Wembley.
