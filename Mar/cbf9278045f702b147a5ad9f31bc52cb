Croydon-born Vertue was working in a shipping office when former school friends, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, asked her to join Associated London Scripts (ALS), where they were working on scripts for Hancock's Half Hour. As well as making tea, typing and answering mail, Vertue found she had a natural way with gifted comics such as Eric Sykes, Tony Hancock and Spike Milligan.  Alongside typing scripts for The Goon Show, she negotiated contracts with TV companies. She helped writer Johnny Speight sell Till Death Us Do Part and worked closely to develop the business acumen of Terry Nation, who created Doctor Who's Daleks. Seeing the commercial potential of Dalek toys, she altered his contract giving him merchandising rights.   She moved into the marketing of programme format rights and sold the Steptoe And Son format to NBC network in the US. But she never lost her ability to push talent. Frankie Howerd wanted to quit showbusiness when she persuaded him to try cabaret. He regained his confidence and soon became a household name.  Showbusiness impresario Robert Stigwood made her ALS's deputy chair and she found herself flying to the US on Concorde to settle deals. She also persuaded maniacal Ike Turner to allow Tina Turner to star in 1975 film Tommy. She left Stigwood to set up Hartswood Films and in 1989 made Men Behaving Badly a hit sitcom. She married her childhood sweetheart Clem Vertue, but divorced in 1984. Beryl Vertue born April 8, 1931 died February 12, 2022
