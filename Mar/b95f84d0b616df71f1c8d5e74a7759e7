He asked British ports to refuse access to ferry services paying below the existing minimum wage – saying the government would legislate soon to protect them in doing so. The Emirati owners of P&O Ferries must understand that the UK “takes employment law seriously” if it is to continue to trade in the country, Mr Shapps suggested. The company prompted outrage on March 17 when it announced it would be replacing staff immediately with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. It led to protests by workers and unions at ports across Britain. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged 23 and over is £8.91 per hour. Mr Shapps said: “P&O Ferries’ failure to see reason, to recognise the public anger, and to do the right thing by their staff has left the Government with no choice. “I am today announcing a package of nine measures that will force them to fundamentally rethink their decision." “This will send a clear message to the maritime industry: we will not allow this to happen again.” Shapps also urged a government regulator to disqualify P&O Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite on the basis he is “unfit to lead a British company.” The Transport Secretary wrote to the Insolvency Service “conveying my firm belief” that the firm’s boss should longer be in charge of the ferry operator. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “P&O’s use of aggressive employment tactics has been completely unacceptable, and we are clamping down on employers who flagrantly fall foul in protecting the rights of their workers." “By ensuring ferry staff working in and out of British ports and in UK waters are paid the National Minimum Wage, this new package will protect UK workers from being ruthlessly exploited by employers, while making sure they receive a fair day’s pay.”
