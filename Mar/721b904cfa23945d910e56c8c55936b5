In 2018, edible insects were ruled a novel food by the bloc - meaning they needed new safety checks. However, when the UK left the EU in 2020, no transition had been agreed for the edible insect industry, meaning traders were no longer able to continue selling their products. The Woven Network, a trade body representing edible insect businesses, is looking ahead to a Food Standards Agency decision in June. It is hoped this will approve trading of insects across the UK. Aaron Thomas, who runs meal kit delivery company Yum Bug, told PA: "There is always a risk that we will be shut down. "We've only just had an inspection from our local environmental health officer [EHO] but... they might have a conversation with a different EHO or someone more senior in their office, that maybe has a different opinion on insects in general, maybe they haven't had as much experience and they tell them 'Actually no, I think you should be shutting the company down'."
