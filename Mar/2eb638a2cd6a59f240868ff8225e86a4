It comes after Russia reportedly disconnected Chernobyl from the power grid, according to Ukrainian forces. Ukrenergo, the Ukrainian state-owned grid operator, claimed there wass “no possibility” of restoring the lines because of Russia's military build-up. But Lukashenko appears to have other ideas. Ukrenergo wrote: “Because of military actions of Russian occupiers the nuclear power plant in Chornobyl was fully disconnected from the power grid. The nuclear station has no power supply. “The military actions are in progress, so there is no possibility to restore the lines.” Now, Belarus, traditionally Russia's ally, has stepped in to restore the power, according to reports. Russian forces took control of the Chernobyl plant, which sits on the Belarusian border, during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine said on Wednesday there was a risk of a radiation leak at Chernobyl after Russia cut off the electricity. It even said the country was 48 hours away from venting radioactive material into the atmosphere. Ukraine's Foreign Minister minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted: ”Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP. After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent.” But the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, saw "no critical impact on security". Russia has in return hit Ukrainian forces with accusations of attacking power lines and a substation feeding the power plant.
