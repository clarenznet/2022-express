Manchester United legend Roy Keane has disputed Ralf Rangnick's explanation for Cristiano Ronaldo's absence against bitter rivals Manchester City. The Portugal star was left out of the squad due to a hip flexor problem but Keane believes something 'doesn't add up,' claiming that Ronaldo is 'a machine' who doesn't get injured very often. Ronaldo made his first appearance in a Manchester derby for 13 years back in November as the Red Devils lost 2-0 to their local rivals. United were limited to just one shot on target at Old Trafford in a performance that many called their 'worst performance in years'. Ronaldo has established himself as the man for the big occasion over his career but will not get the chance to help United today. Rangnick explained that Ronaldo was left out of the match-day squad due to an injury. And Keane aired his shock at Ronaldo's absence and questioned whether an injury was the true reason behind the forward's omission. "The surprise is Ronaldo with the problem with his hip flexor, but United have a bit of pace," Keane said on Sky Sports. "They still have to come out and play with pride and quality. Elanga is a good player, positive and is an intelligent player. "There seems to be something more with the Ronaldo situation, the manager coming out talking about something about his hip flexor but the man is a machine and is rarely injured. "Every now and again he comes out with that about his hip flexor, doesnâ€™t add up to me."  Ronaldo has scored nine goals in 23 Premier League games this season, his worst return for any club since he left United for Real Madrid in 2009.   Elsewhere, United are without Raphael Varane and Luke Shaw, who both tested positive for COVID-19 in midweek. Furthermore, Edinson Cavani misses out with a groin injury, despite training well over the last three days. United will look to leapfrog Arsenal into fourth with a win after the Gunners won 3-2 at Watford earlier on Sunday.
