Jamie Redknapp, 48, recently welcomed his first child with wife Frida Redknapp, 37. Speaking on The One Show tonight, Jamie opened up a bit about fatherhood and his new son Raphael. Jamie admitted he’d just been talking to fellow guest James Bay about fatherhood. He said: “We’ve just been talking about it, it’s the most incredible experience. “To do it 17 years ago with my oldest Charlie and Bo, 13 and now Rafael, five months. “It’s amazing! You know what it’s like Alex [Jones].  “It’s been a joy, it really has.” Jamie’s first two children were with his ex-wife Louise Redknapp. The couple were married from 1998 until 2017. However, they announced their split after 19 years of marriage.  Jamie remarried earlier this year to model Frida in a ceremony in Chelsea. The couple’s family were in attendance and Frida was pregnant at the time. Jamie announced his son’s birth back on November 24 with an adorable Instagram post of the pair. He wrote: “Meet Raphael Anders Redknapp, we’re so in love, mum is doing so well too.  DON'T MISS...
