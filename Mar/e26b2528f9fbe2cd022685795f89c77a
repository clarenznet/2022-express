Every year certain people receive a cold weather payment when the temperature drops, or is predicted to fall below zero, for seven consecutive days. With the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) scheme due to end on March 31, now is the time to check eligibility. Britons receiving six state benefits usually qualify for additional help in the form of a cold weather payment. Millions of people on pension credit, income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, support for mortgage interest and Universal Credit rely on these extra payments to help them pay their energy bills. So far this year, at least 22 areas of the UK have been cold enough to trigger cold weather payments. However, not everyone who receives Universal Credit will automatically qualify.
