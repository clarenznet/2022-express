The Russian Defense Ministry’s TV channel, Zvezda, has shared footage of Syrian combatants ready to fight in Ukraine. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia knew of “more than 16,000 applications” from countries in the Middle East. Putin approved bringing in “volunteer” fighters and told his defence minister to help them “move to the combat zone.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, reacted to the Russian plan to recruit Syrian volunteers: “Russia is hiring ISIS,” he says. The recruitment of Syrians has stoked fears that the Syria playbook could be rolled out, which includes the use of chemical weapons. The video shows soldiers brandishing the Russian flag, along with posters of Putin and his ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hussam Hammoud, a Syrian journalist, pointed out on Twitter that Syrian Arab Army soldiers are fighting "due to the official military orders of the Assad regime. It's not volunteering." This comes as a senior US defence official said on Thursday that the Russian forces moved three miles closer to the capital, Kyiv, in the past 24 hours and are just nine miles from the city centre.
