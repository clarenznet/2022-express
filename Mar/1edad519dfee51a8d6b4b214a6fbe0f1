Andrew Gillon passed away during surgery on January 7. The 59-year-old, from Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, had fallen down the stairs and broken his neck at a friend’s house on New Year’s Day. Andrew’s heartbroken daughter Lisa Thomas, 33, was then shocked to find out her father had been selected as a winner of Scotland’s biggest single Postcode Lottery jackpot, despite her stopping his payments the month before. The Scottish Water worker had been playing the competition for several years and was sent a golden envelope along with the rest of the players on his street. Lisa, from Hamilton, and Andrew’s grandchildren Connor, Farrah and Aspen, collected his share of the £7.9million prize at an event in Glasgow last weekend and were delighted to find out he had won £8,092. The family said it was the last gift from Andrew. Lisa added: “We’re all delighted. Farrah was crying her eyes out for hours after she found out how much dad had won. “We haven’t really spoken about what we’re going to do with all the money yet, but probably a holiday to Florida. “That’s where we got married and I have loads of amazing memories there with my dad. “I’ve been five times and never without my dad being there so it will be a sore one, but I know that’s where he would want to go.” Lisa admitted collecting the prize in Andrew’s honour was bitter sweet. She said: “It’s hard to say I’m excited as my biggest emotion about it is sadness that he’s not here to enjoy the excitement of the day with us, but we will be there thinking of him and thanking him.” Lisa said she and her father had a laugh at Christmas as the first card he received was from the Postcode Lottery. She added: “I was laughing at him for his first Christmas card being from them. “All I remember him saying is, ‘Well you won’t be laughing when I win!’ and he was right I wasn’t laughing, I was crying.”
