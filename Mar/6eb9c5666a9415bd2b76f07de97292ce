Britt Ekland, 79, showed off her physical prowess in an unearthed dance-inspired photoshoot. The model put her endless legs on display in colourful leotards and leg warmers. She made sure to showcase her athletic build as she contorted while posing for the camera. One of the photographs shows the actress fleeing her muscles in front of a mirror as she flaunted a big smile. The blonde bombshell wore various different sets of leotards and matching leg warmers for the photoshoot. She opted to keep her medium-length blonde tresses down as she exercised in front of a mirror in the ballet studio. True to the 1980s style, Britt wore bright blue eye makeup that she complemented with a nude lip.
