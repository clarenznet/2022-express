Last weekend marked the conclusion of the couple’s eight-day tour, billed as a charm offensive, which saw them visit Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas. William and Kate faced disruption right from the offset as they were forced to cancel their first engagement at a sustainable cocoa farm in Indian Creek following uproar among locals about indigenous people’s rights and colonialism. Indian Creek chairman Sebastian Shol told the Daily Mail one day before the pair arrived “We don’t want them to land on our land, that’s the message that we want to send”, and then called the tour a “slap in the face”. The tour was also marred by protests calling for reparations from the Royal Family over their links to the slave trade and renewed calls for the nations to remove the Queen as head of state and become a republic, much like Barbados did in November. A source claimed that the couple “were looking forward” to the trip, but added that it was more “challenging” than anticipated. The source told US Weekly: “It was certainly more challenging than expected given the protests. They obviously know the history, but being there during the protests was a real eye-opener.” They added that William and Kate are "overwhelmed by remorse". FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
