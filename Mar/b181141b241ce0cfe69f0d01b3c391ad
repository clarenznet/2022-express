Bradford South MP Judith Cummins wants to stop irresponsible drivers of quad bikes putting lives at risk in towns and cities. She says the four-wheeled vehicles cause a “massive noise nuisance” and their “reckless, dangerous and illegal use” is a threat to pedestrians and other road users. The Labour MP claims that more than 1,000 quad bikes are stolen from farms every year and many that are not safe for use on roads end up being ridden on streets. Last month NFU Mutual urged farmers to strengthen their security because of a “surge in quad thefts”, warning that thieves are “slicker, more determined and more prolific than before”. This week Ms Cummins will introduce new legislation to crack down on the misuse of quad bikes and give new powers to the police. She said: “The police work hard to deal with problem quads, but once seized, there’s no guarantee that they won’t end up back on the roads plaguing the very same neighbourhoods time and time again. This is a cycle that must be broken. What is happening where you live?

My bill will propose giving police the powers they need to dispose of these quads once seized so they can never be used illegally on our streets again. “I am also calling for consistency in the law for wearing helmets – we must make helmets a legal requirement for quad users on public roads, just as they are for motorbikes and mopeds. The evidence is clear that helmets help prevent serious injury. Legislation needs to catch up with the reality of the growing number of quads on our roads. “Finally, I want immobilisers to be mandatory on quads. This adds another layer of protection for legitimate owners like farmers and deters thefts, reducing the number of stolen vehicles getting onto the roads in the first place.”
