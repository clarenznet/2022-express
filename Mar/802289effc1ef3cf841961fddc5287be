To celebrate Sir Paul McCartney's 80th birthday and the 60th anniversary of the Fab Four's debut single, the trust will host musical events at Sir Paul's childhood home in south Liverpool at 20 Forthlin Road. The semi-detached childhood home of John Lennon is on the magical mystery tour of the city's musical past and has also been preserved in all its 1950s glory by the trust. Director general Hilary McGrady said: "This year we'll be exploring the incredible story of an ordinary home in Liverpool, where four working-class lads transformed the world of music forever." Its 2022 programme also includes a pledge to connect people to the "restorative power of nature". Seventy tree-planting projects - including new avenues and orchards - will cele- brate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Other properties with significant collections will host exhibitions, including Upton House in Warwickshire, Plas Newydd on Anglesey and Mount Stewart in County Down. An annual lecture series - named after trust founder Octavia Hill - will be launched, starting with historian Neil MacGregor. Ms McGrady, below, said: "Octavia Hill spoke about 'the healing gift of space'. Nature helps us to reconnect, to breathe and to escape. The pandemic reminded us of its importance. "But it showed those benefits aren't available to all - too many children are growing up without experiencing the joy of nature." That is why the conservation charity is turning the Castlefield Viaduct in central Manchester into an elevated urban park, she added.
