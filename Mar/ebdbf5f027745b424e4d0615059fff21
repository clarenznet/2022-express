On the first day of fundraising £55 million was raised by the joint effort between the UK Government and Disasters Emergency Committee as people dug into their pockets to help. The amount was only surpassed by the tsunami fund in 2004 after a series of countries were devastated by one of the biggest natural disasters in recent history. Speaking to the Sunday Express, Ms Truss said: “I think you have seen in the public response just how concerned people are. The appeal we launched together with DEC (the Disasters Emergency Committee) has already raised £55 million in a day. A record since the Tsunami disaster in 2004. “People want to know what they can do to help.” She added: “There has been a huge response across Parliament. There is tremendous unity because we all understand what we are fighting for. “The idea that a dictator can win is so abhorrent and so worrying for European security that we are determined to do what we can to stop it.”  But the Foreign Secretary also warned that the British people will need to make sacrifices at home and pay more for goods and energy as a result of the sanctions. She vowed that there is now a roadmap in place to significantly reduce the amount of oil and gas purchased by Russia. While the UK only gets 3 percent of its supply from Russia some EU countries get as much as 100 percent with Germany getting more than half its supply from Russia. “People might have to pay more but it is nothing like the cost that the Ukrainian people were suffering, and it is nothing like the cost of not stopping Putin. “The cost of not stopping him now would be disastrous.” She warned that there would be international consequences for failing to tackle Putin now. “It is not just about European security. What will the message be to the rest of the world? If Putin doesn’t lose, that will embolden other aggressors around the world.”
