The Prime Minister’s spokesperson said Mr Johnson and Charle Michel, European Council president, spoke over the phone on Monday. However, in the readout of the call, no invitation was issued to Mr Johnson for the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday about Ukraine. Government sources previously said it was “looking unlikely” Mr Johnson will be invited to Brussels after his remarks comparing Ukraine’s desire for freedom with the UK’s Brexit vote. Reports suggested there is “anger” in Brussels “about what the PM did/ didn't mean by his remarks in Blackpool”.

"Macron, Scholz et al saw this as an insult and so an opportunity to highlight West unity and serious UK contribution lost. Miserable.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
