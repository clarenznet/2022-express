Mark replied: "To be fair to them, Jeopardy doesn’t encourage that." Bill tweeted: "I don't know why they wouldn't want you back. It's always a nice surprise when you're announced as the chaser. As for Brooke, I really wish they'd make her the host of @Jeopardy! She's perfect for that!" Michael Tartaglia remarked: "Sad that @MarkLabbett won't be returning - forever the greatest Chaser - got me in love with this show on GSN with Brooke Burns. Hope he gets invited back next season." Frank L added: "Given that I'm waiting to hear back on being on the show... this is the worst news I have heard all day."
