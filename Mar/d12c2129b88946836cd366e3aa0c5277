The albino frog was snapped in Victoria Park, which sits to the north-west of the city near the River Clyde. Adam Bienkowski, who spotted the amazing amphibian, said it “really stood out against the others”.  Albino animals are a rarity, and their condition is caused by a mutation of certain genes which affect the amount of melanin, or skin pigment, produced in the body. While albinos can sometimes be photo-sensitive, the carrot-coloured frog in Glasgow was more than happy to have its picture taken. Mr Bienkowski, 38, explained that he had spotted the “super rare Irn Bru frog” surrounded by “hundreds” of normal coloured ones in the park’s pond.

Irn Bru - which has been described as Scotland’s second national drink after whisky - has been made in Scotland for over 120 years. It is known for its distinctive bright orange colour. He said: “Irn Bru was the first thing I thought of when I saw the orange colour.”  However, Mr Bienkowski fears that the unique creature may not be destined for survival, believing that its bright colour will make it more obvious to prey. He said: “I don’t imagine it will last long in nature - it’s bound to get eaten very quickly with that stark colour.”
