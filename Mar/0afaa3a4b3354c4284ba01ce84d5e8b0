On Saturday, Musk had said that the Starlink system was already “active” in Ukraine and more equipment to use it was on the way. Mykhailo Fedorov, Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, thanked Mr Musk on Twitter after receiving the consignment.  Mr Musk replied with: “You are most welcome”. Mr Fedorov also shared an image of the Starlink dishes on the back of a truck. The vice prime minister had earlier asked Mr Musk for use of the service. Starlink is the low-Earth orbit internet service that SpaceX has been building out for the past several years.   It is a constellation of connected satellites that, in theory, will be able to provide high-speed internet to large swaths of the world. So far, SpaceX has launched more than 2,000 of these satellites and put nearly 100 satellites into orbit this week alone on two separate launches. The entire constellation is planned to have more than 4,000 satellites when complete. Starlink differs from other satellite internet services because they are in low-Earth orbit rather than geostationary orbit, which allows them to provide faster internet speeds (because the signal doesn’t have to go as far).

Captain refuses to fuel Russian ship  The terminals look like home satellite television dishes and can provide relatively fast internet service, by residential standards, by connecting to a fleet of satellites in low orbit. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab project, has warned the terminals could become Russian targets. He tweeted: “Re: @elonmusk's starlink donation. Good to see. But remember: if #Putin controls the air above Ukraine, users' uplink transmissions become beacons ... for airstrikes."
