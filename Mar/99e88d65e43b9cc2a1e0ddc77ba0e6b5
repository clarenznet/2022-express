Wordle puzzles have become a daily highlight for millions of people across the world. But ever since The New York Times purchased exclusive rights to Wordle, there's a sense that the daily puzzles are getting harder. If you've been struggling to solve those Wordle teasers, then Express Online will be posting daily tips for each puzzle, beginning with Wordle 256. We won't be giving away the answer, but continue to the bottom of the page if you want a little help solving the daily Wordle, courtesy of three clues. If you're reading this article then you probably already know how to play Wordle, but just in case you're not familiar, here's a refresher. Players are given six chances to guess a five-letter word, by process of elimination. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Read on for the Wordle 256 hints... General Wordle tips... • Don't use the same letter twice in your opening guess. • Try to use a couple of vowels in your first guess, particularly 'A' and 'E'. • Avoid letters such as 'X', 'Z' and 'Q' until later on, when you have a better idea what the answer is. • 'CRANE' is a good word to start with, while 'GHOUL' is a decent second guess. Wordle 256 tips and hints... 1. Wordle 256 isn't the hardest puzzle to solve, even if it is a rather unpleasant word. 2. Today's Wordle puzzle only has one vowel in it. 3. If you really want a helping hand, Wordle 256 starts with the letter 'N' and ends with the letter 'Y'.
