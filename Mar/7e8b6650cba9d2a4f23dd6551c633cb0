Cristiano Ronaldo and his fellow Manchester United attackers have been called out by Liverpool hero John Barnes, who believes Harry Maguire isn’t given enough protection by the Red Devils’ frontline. Maguire has come in for heavy criticism due to a string of poor performances this season and was booed during England’s friendly with Ivory Coast on Tuesday. Unlike Manchester City and Liverpool, Ralf Rangnick’s side aren’t used to playing an intensive pressing style of football, with their attackers being more dilatory in their attempts to close down opposition defenders. Ronaldo has already come under fire this season due to his perceived lack of defensive effort. And Barnes thinks that is part of the reason Maguire has struggled this camnpaign and has dismissed any suggestions that United’s preferred formation of playing with a back four is to blame. “Harry Maguire will not be leaving Manchester United to go to a club that plays a back three like Tottenham,” Barnes told BonusCodeBets. “That’s a nonstarter. “Maguire has played in back fours for the majority of his career and including for England. I don’t believe he plays better in a back three than a back four. When England played with a back four, he played well.

It is all to do with the protection he gets from the hard-working England players in front of him, whereas at United the front four don’t work hard enough to protect the defence. He’s just more comfortable playing for England.” Maguire has made 31 appearances for United this season but has been unable to prevent the Red Devils dropping to sixth in the Premier League table. He also couldn’t make the difference when his side were dispatched by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 after they had already exited the FA Cup in the fourth round at the hands of Middlesbrough.

And England boss Gareth Southgate has defended the player after the reception he received during his latest international appearance. “I thought the reception was a joke - an absolute joke,” Southgate hissed after his team defeated Ivory Coast 3-0. “What he's done for us and the way he has performed for England has been phenomenal. I don't get it. We're either all in this together or we're not. “He's in an England shirt and not only should you support someone in an England shirt regardless but when he's played at the level he has, it should be total commitment behind him."
