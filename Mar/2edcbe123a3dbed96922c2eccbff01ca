Mercedes may be behind rivals Red Bull and Ferrari in terms of the development of their W13, but Christian Horner is refusing to "write off" the seven-time world champion in Bahrain. Ever since testing in Barcelona, it was clear that Ferrari had put together a competitive car. Less clear was how Red Bull and Mercedes would fair until official pre-season testing in Bahrain last week. Mercedes unveiled a bold new design with minimal sidepods while Red Bull had also changed their car around. It was the latter who appeared to be on top of things though while both Hamilton and George Russell complained of several issues. Heading into the first race of the season, both Mercedes drivers were downplaying their chances of battling at the front. And that was evident in qualifying on Saturday with Ferrari and Red Bull far out in front. Max Verstappen lines up just behind Charles Leclerc on the front row with Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez primed in third and fourth respectively. JUST IN:Â Christian Horner makes prediction about Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes   Hamilton did enough to secure fifth on the grid, but it proved to be a disappointing Q3 for Russell as he could only manage ninth. Mercedes have admitted that they're likely to be more focussed on keeping those behind them at bay as opposed to battling with the Ferraris and Red Bull. Horner appears hopeful that Verstappen and Perez can take on the challenge that Ferrari posses. But the Red Bull team principal is still cautious of a determined Hamilton sitting just behind them. DON'T MISS  "We know both Charles and Carlos, they're very strong drivers," he told Sky Sports. "Look, lets not write off Lewis, who's starting just behind us. "He's gonna be pumped up coming into this race so the first lap's gonna be crucial."
