Economic sanctions imposed by a unified group of western nations have done little to deter Mr Putin so far, as he continues to push for Kyiv. A renewed push on the country's capital has seen dangerous new missile raids land on residential areas, with the Russian premier seeming undeterred. Data from the Bank of Russia and compiled by Statista shows that, over the last few years, he has cultivated a significant war chest of reserves that may have helped cushion the blow on Russian society. In the four years from 2018, the country has focussed on its foreign exchange reserves and gold supplies. Between 2018 and 2022, the combined value of both has increased by nearly $200 billion (£149 billion). In 2018, the total sat at $447.7 billion (£333 billion), split between approximately $380 billion of foreign exchange reserves and $67.7 billion (£49 billion) of gold. The following year saw a modest increase, as the total rose to around £470 billion (£350 billion), Statista's graphs show.

Gold reserves approached $100 billion (£74 billion), while the foreign exchange reserves settled around $440 billion (£328 billion), a realm in which they remained in 2021. By January 31 of 2021 gold reserves had increased again, pushing past the $100 billion (£74 billion) mark. Together, gold and foreign exchange reserves at that point had neared £600 billion in total. But this time, sanctions have had an unprecedented effect on the Russian economy. The reserves Mr Putin built have failed to weather the blow delivered by the west. The Central Bank of Russia filled out the reserves with foreign currencies to sustain the ruble through tough times. Analysis of the recent sanctions suggests they could drain the $630 billion stockpile almost completely. At present, there is little evidence that the reserves managed to blunt the sanctions blow on the ruble. As of March 2, the ruble is worth 110 to the US dollar in Moscow, putting the Russian financial system on the brink. The value, an all-time low, was 7.3 percent weaker compared to March 1, when it bottomed out at 108.60 to the dollar. Since the start of 2022, that marks an overall decline of one third compared to USD.
