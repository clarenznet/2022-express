Gardeners' World star Monty Don, 66, has taken to social media to warn fans about a fake account that has been messaging Monty’s followers. The Gardeners' World presenter explained that fans shouldn’t engage with anyone claiming to be him who messages them. The star stated that he “never messages anyone” so it’s definitely not him. He uploaded a photo and included the message in the caption to the post. The post was shared with Monty’s 1 million followers.

The fan said he was incensed at the fact that Monty had promoted burying plastics on Gardeners’ World. The Twitter user then took the initiative to recommend an alternative to Monty. OrganicBishop said: “@TheMontyDon we love following you and seeing you at talks. “However I cannot believe you promoted burying plastics on Gardeners' World. “Especially when Hereford has such a good “heat from waste” regeneration plant - micro plastics are killing the planet.”
