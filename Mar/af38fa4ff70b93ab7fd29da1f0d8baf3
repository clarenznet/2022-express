Max Verstappen put in a stunning performance to secure his first win of the 2022 Formula 1 season at Sunday’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The reigning world champion completed a spectacular overtake on Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to close the gap on his rival at the top of the Drivers’ Championship standings. The Dutchman showed off his cunning racecraft by intelligently waiting to avoid passing Leclerc prior to the DRS zone, which proved to be the best time to make an overtake stick. It was the perfect response from Verstappen and Red Bull after he failed to finish in Bahrain last weekend. Verstappen’s teammate Sergio Perez took a brilliant pole position but his race progress was cruelly undone by an ill-timed safety car soon after he pitted. It basically gifted Leclerc, Verstappen and Carlos Sainz a free pit stop, and they all passed the Mexican. Sainz went on to finish in third and complete a double podium for Ferrari after the Italian motorsport giants won the Bahrain Grand Prix with a one-two. Perez - who also broke down prior to finishing the race the week before - earned the first points of his season with a fourth-place finish, while George Russell rounded out the top five.
