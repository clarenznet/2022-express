  Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has shared the news that her daughter Lexi is joining Kate Moss’ modelling agency after they saw some snaps of the teen online. Storm, who has helped launch the careers of fashion icons including Cara Delevingne, 29, and Cindy Crawford, 56, reportedly “came after” Amanda’s 16-year-old daughter before her eighteenth birthday.      In a new interview, Amanda, 51, joked that she would love to become a “momager” like Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kris Jenner, 66. However, it was her daughter Lexi’s decision alone to sign with the agency, despite some interest from other competitors. Amanda said: “Lexi has just signed with Storm Management this week. “They came after her and they're very lovely and nurturing and it will be a soft, slow thing and she won't do anything until she's 18 but they want her and that's what she wants to do.
