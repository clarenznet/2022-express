Football Focus presenter Alex Scott stunned this evening as she attended the BAFTAs at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The sports presenter, 37, sent jaws dropping as she donned a glitzy floor-length gown that revealed she had opted to go underwear-free, thanks to the daring, thigh-high split up the side. Taking to the red carpet at the star studded event, Alex looked the epitome of glamorous in the dazzling soft pink gown. Featuring a high neck and long sleeves, the sports presenter put on a daring display as she jutted one leg saucily out the side of the garment. The exquisite gown also featured an intricately ruched panel over the star's bust, flashing sections of her toned midriff. The BBC host paired the gown with a matching pair of sequined stilettos and ear jewellery.
