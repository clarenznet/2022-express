The Unboxed: Creativity, previously called the Festival of Brexit, is meant to showcase the best of the country's creativity following its withdrawal from the bloc. However a new scathing report from the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has called it a "recipe for failure" and an "irresponsible use of public money", sparking reaction from Britons. One remainer, Mr Oluwole, voiced his outrage at spending £120 million on the festival, "during a cost-of-living crisis while increasing national insurance." He then slammed those who voted to leave the EU: "Meanwhile, the true believers in Brexit have been battered to insanity by reality." The event's organisers have rejected the “festival of Brexit” label and said it is "a UK-wide groundbreaking celebration of creativity taking place in 2022", but Theresa May said in 2018 she wanted to "showcase what makes our country great” as Britain left the EU. It is still unknown whether the festival will go ahead or not. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
