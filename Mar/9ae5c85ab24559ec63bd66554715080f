Charles Leclerc will be looking to pip Max Verstappen to pole position for tomorrow's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix by setting the fastest time in this evening's qualifying session. The Ferrari driver, who took the chequered flag at last weekend's season-opening race in Bahrain, topped the timesheets at the end of all three practice sessions and will be hoping for another impressive showing on the streets of Jeddah against the clock. It was decided ahead of FP3 that the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will go ahead as planned despite a missile attack on a nearby oil facility that filled the sky with black smoke on Friday afternoon. A four-hour meeting between drivers, officials and team representatives was held in the early hours of this morning before all parties unanimously decided to race in Jeddah after receiving safety assurances from the Saudi government. Leclerc will go into this evening's qualifying session as the favourite to claim pole position ahead of Verstappen after setting the quickest lap in the final practice session by a margin of just 0.033 seconds. The Monegasque driver will also be forced to contend with the likes of Ferrari team-mate Carlos Sainz and Red Bull's Sergio Perez as he looks to start tomorrow's race ahead of the chasing pack for the second time in as many weeks.
