Lord Dannatt also explained the way to end the invasion was by negotiating around a table instead of a battlefield.  Lord Dannatt said: "Russia fears China, because of China's burgeoning economic growth. "But at the same time, Russia needs a friend, and because of that linkage, which has got stronger in recent days.
