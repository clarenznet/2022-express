 Reports emerged earlier in the week that conflicts had arisen in the Mercedes garage following Russell's move from Williams earlier this season. Having finished 15th last season, Russell showed enough promise to be called up to the side following Valtteri Bottas' move to Alfa Romeo earlier this year. However, the King's Lynn-born star was rumoured to have caused tension with Hamilton as a direct rival for podium positions in the upcoming season. Despite this, the pair are said to be on good terms, with competition always being successful at Mercedes - as proved by Hamilton's 'rivalry' with former team-mate Nico Rosberg. And Russell has told of how Hamilton has nothing to prove ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. “You know, Lewis has nothing to prove," Russell said to Sky.  "The Mercedes philosophy is if you’re at Mercedes, you’re there for a reason. They’re not there to test you,” he continued. “They are there because they believe in you. That goes beyond me as a driver and it goes for everyone in the team. They believe me, I believe in myself, and I believe over time I will get there. So if you look at it like that, there’s no pressure.” Hamilton will look to claim his fourth straight win at the Bahrain Grand Prix despite finishing fifth in qualifying. Charles Leclerc took pole position, whilst Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz made up the top three.  Elsewhere, Hamilton is in fifth whilst Russell takes up ninth in a relatively impressive first outing in the new Mercedes vehicle. The British veteran won the 2019, 2020 and 2021 editions of the race with relative ease. The Bahrain Grand Prix suffered a huge shock in 2020 when Romain Grosjean's car caught on fire, escaping with second degree burns on hands.
