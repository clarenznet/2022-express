Setting out his vision in a speech at the Royal College of Physicians in London, the Health Secretary vowed to put the "full power of the NHS behind prevention" to stop long-term conditions like heart disease. Patients who have been waiting more than 18 months for NHS treatment will be contacted by the end of the year with options to choose an alternative provider - either NHS or private. And there will be a push to utilise digital tools and increase use of the NHS app. Mr Javid said: "It needs to be as easy for doctors and patients to order a blood test as it is to order a burger on the phone."
