There were more deaths than usual from the disorders early in the pandemic but fewer in recent months, according to Office for National Statistics figures. From March to December 2020, fatalities were 9.7 percent higher than usual, with a total of 4,990 excess deaths. But in 2021, deaths due to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were 4,417 below average, a 6.7 percent decrease. The ONS said the figures offer “cautious evidence that the indirect effects of the pandemic may have accelerated mortality in certain causes of death, thereby causing deaths to be below average later in the pandemic”.
