It may be a Monday, but at least there's a new Wordle puzzle to solve. Wordle 275 is live for March 21, meaning you have just 24-hours to solve the new puzzle and keep that winning streak alive. If you're struggling with Wordle 275 for March 21, then you've come to the right place, because Express Online has put together a selection of three spoiler-free clues to help you figure out the answer. Good luck, and remember to check back tomorrow for the next batch of Wordle clues. If you like the look of Wordle but aren't quite sure how to play it, here's how the popular puzzle game works. Players are given just six chances to guess a different five-letter word each day. You'll need to use the process of elimination to get the correct answer, so use your guesses wisely. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, your success rate as a percentage, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Check out the latest hints for Wordle 275 below...
