It proposes cutting ticket prices by half – from £2 to £1 – and having two draws on one night. Allwyn is owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komarek, who has made an estimated £4.2billion fortune in oil ­and gas. And the entrepreneur got his birthday wish yesterday when he won the rights to operate the National Lottery for 10 years. He turned 53 in style by scooping the top prize following months of robust competition. Taking to professional networking site LinkedIn, he called it “the best birthday present ever”. Allwyn is one of Europe’s largest lottery firms, operating in the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and Austria. It will take over the National Lottery in 2024 after being named ­as the Gambling Commission’s “preferred bidder”. Due to the secretive bidding process for the lottery, Allwyn has yet to ­give much away about its planned changes. But reports say it pledged to donate £38billion to good causes over the next decade, and slash ticket prices to £1. The decision is a blow to Camelot, whose CEO Nigel Railton said: “We’re carefully reviewing the Gambling Com-mission’s evaluation before deciding on our next steps.” One of Mr Komarek’s subsidiary companies has previously been involved in joint ventures with the German arm of Gazprom, which is majority owned by the Russian state and has ­been targeted in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The Gambling Commission says that it is “satisfied that no application is impacted by sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine”.
