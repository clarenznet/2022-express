EuroMillions is back tonight with a £14 million jackpot up for grabs. The life changing amount of money could be yours for just £2.50 per play, and by tomorrow you could be a multimillionaire. Nine European countries take part in the EuroMillions every Tuesday and Friday, including the UK, Ireland, Spain, France, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland. But luckily, you don’t need to travel far to play as you can easily select your numbers from the comfort of your own home online via the National Lottery’s website or app. Or, you can buy your ticket at your local newsagents, petrol stations, post offices and supermarkets. All you need to do is choose five numbers from one to 50, and two Lucky Stars from one to 12. Tickets can only be bought between 6am and 11pm online and in store: on draw days, tickets need to be bought before 7.30pm for it to count towards that day’s draw. If you’re feeling lazy, you can opt for a Lucky Dip, which will randomly generate the numbers on your behalf. You must be 18 or older to play any National Lottery game. Tonight’s winning Thunderball numbers are: 23, 28, 34, 35, 37 and the Thunderball is 1. The winning EuroMillions numbers tonight are: 7, 17, 21, 29, 40 and the lucky stars are 8 and 11. With EuroMillions, there's another way to win, with each ticket having a unique code for the Millionaire Maker. If your code is selected, you would become a millionaire overnight. When it comes to the Thunderball, the jackpot is smaller at £500,000, but the draw takes place every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. To bag the jackpot you'll need to match five main numbers, plus the Thunderball. There are also a range of prizes for those who match some of the numbers drawn. Just five numbers and one lucky star will be enough to claim £130,554.30, while five main draw numbers alone are worth £13,561.20. Should a winning ticket not be found, then the total sum will roll over to the next draw, and so on until a winner is found.
