Premium Bonds must be held for one full calendar month before their numbers are entered into the monthly draw. Now, three winners have earned themselves £10,000 despite only having bought their bonds in January this year.  The three £10,000 winning bond numbers that were only bought in January were: 484PD184260 484WM029442 487RW393172. The first winner, who is based overseas, bought their winning bond in January for £10,000, holding a total of £15,010 in Premium Bonds.   Another winner from Cambridgeshire got a huge sum in their very first prize draw, with only £10,355 in total holdings, they scooped £10,000 in their winning bond. A third winner from Fife, having only bought their bonds in January 2022, held a total of the threshold £50,000 with the winning bond holding worth £20,000. As they have only held their winning bonds for one month, these three lucky bond holders have essentially seen an interest rate of between 50 and 100 percent. The automated system for choosing Premium Bond numbers for high value prizes has been reported time and again to be completely impartial to both how much one has in their bond holdings and when the bond was bought.  This has once again been proven by some of the £10,000 winners, three of which won with only having bought their bonds not even two months ago while another winner bought their winning £500 bond in January 1996. The March prize draw conducted earlier this week saw two Premium Bonds millionaires announced and thousands of others snapping up high value prizes. Premium Bond holders are able to check if they are part of this month's winning numbers through the prize checker app or the NS&I website. Customers should have their NS&I number and Bond number to hand as they will need this to use the app or website.  Each Premium Bond holder stands the chance every month to win between £25 and £1million in the prize draws. The prize draws are generally made on the first of each month. Premium Bonds customers are also advised of a quicker way to claim their prizes by getting them paid directly to their bank account or automatically reinvested into more Premium Bonds. This has been done in the hopes that it will reduce the number of prizes that go unclaimed.  As of November 2021 there were 2,079,568 Premium Bond prizes of varying amounts left unclaimed. These are classed as prizes that have not been claimed within 18 months of being announced. Undoubtedly the total number is much higher as those that have been announced more recently will not count towards this tally just yet. As there is no time limit on claiming Premium Bonds winnings, customers are urged to check all of their own numbers as well as any they may inherit as there could very well be unclaimed gold.
