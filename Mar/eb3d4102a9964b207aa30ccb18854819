Nile Gardiner reacted with fury to the suggestion that the US Vice President could be sent to Poland and Romania. The trip is to show US solidarity with those countries after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The Telegraph journalist said Ms Harris was "the last" US official that should be sent to Europe during a time of crisis. Writing on Twitter Mr Gardiner slammed the Vice President as a "catastrophe". He said: "Kamala Harris has been a disastrous vice president at home. "Her handling of the southern border crisis has been a catastrophe.  "She is the last US official that should be sent over to Europe as it faces its biggest threat since World War Two." According to The Hill, White House sources have indicated Ms Harris could be sent to meet US troops stationed in Romania. She could also potentially visit the border with Ukraine during the visit which is expected in the coming weeks. It comes as the US has sent 3,000 additional troops to NATO members Poland and Romania.
