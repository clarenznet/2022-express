A life-changing £25 million is up for grabs during tonight's EuroMillions if someone can lay claim to a winning ticket. All will be revealed at 8.45pm tonight. So, do you have the winning entry? The EuroMillions describes itself as the “game with jackpots so enormous you can probably see them from space”. A transnational lottery, the EuroMillions requires seven correct numbers to win the jackpot. Originally, it was launched on February 7, 2004 by France's Française des Jeux, Spain's Loterías y Apuestas del Estado and the United Kingdom's Camelot.
