President Volodymyr Zelensky urged EU leaders to sanction the emergency move to enable his country to become part of the 27-nation bloc.Â The joining process usually takes years and all member nations have to unanimously agree on the move.  However it could be rushed through after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen appeared to signal the green light for membership, saying: "They belong to us. They are one of us and we want them in." Yesterday afternoon President Zelensky signed the official application for EU membership. Irish premier Michael Martin gave the move his backing. He said: "I don't know whether it can be done immediately. But I certainly would be a proponent and supporter of accelerating it and making it very clear that they can become members of the European Union."
