It was only a few days ago that a new record completion time for Elden Ring was revealed, with YouTuber niko belic beating Elden Ring without dying in around two and a half hours. At the time this was the fastest anyone had ever completed Elden Ring, but already this record has been broken twice in swift succession. First up was streamer LilAggy who posted the first ever sub one hour time for Elden Ring. Sharing a video of his playthrough on Twitter the streamer wrote: "First person in the world to complete Elden Ring in under one hour". But this record didn't stand for long, with another streamer - Distortion2 - revealing not long afterwards that he had managed to beat Elden Ring in under 50 minutes. On Twitter @Distortion_2 shared: "FIRST TO FINISH ELDEN RING IN UNDER 50 MINUTES. This game is going to probably go under 40 minutes." Posting a link to the YouTube speed run the streamer added: "Video incase anyone wants to watch. This was also my first run attempt".  For most players, they would probably spend around an hour crafting their character just the way they like it and then taking their first steps into the Lands Between. So to manage to complete Elden Ring in the same amount of time that plenty of people would only begin their journey...well, it's something else isn't it? The amount of time it's taking speed runners to complete Elden Ring keeps on tumbling, so we'll have to wait and see whether someone soon ends up posting a sub 40 minute completion time.
