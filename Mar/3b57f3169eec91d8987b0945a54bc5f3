Former hairdresser Louise Reeves, 35, battled brother Bill, 47, after their rags-to-riches former orphan father Kevin died, leaving her 80 per cent of his Southampton-based cash and property empire. He had previously intended to split the 80 per cent equally between Bill, Louise and their half-sister Lisa Murray, with each share worth about £27million. The remaining 20 per cent was to go to his estranged son Mark's two children. But Kevin's final will in 2014 left Bill with just a collection of personal possessions worth about £200,000. High Court judge Mr Justice Michael Green ruled last month that the will was invalid, since Louise could not prove that Kevin "knew and approved" of its contents. He also found that "very materialistic" Louise probably "engineered" the document. It means that Louise and Bill will get £27million each, with the rest split between Lisa and other relatives.  This week the judge ordered Louise to pick up 70 per cent of her brother's bill for the bitter legal fight, during which each side accused the other of lying. It is likely to be more than £1million, lawyers said, on top of her own £1million costs. Mr Justice Green rejected the claim that Louise had bullied her dad, but said "she is capable of being ruthless and manipulative, using her intelligence and willingness to take risks to act deviously for her own personal interests". Kevin, who died aged 71 in 2019, grew up as an orphan in a convent and left school when he was 12 before building up his vast empire.
