April is a month of change, introducing the start of the new tax year, and sadly rising bills. However, there are also important state pension changes to bear in mind. Making note will ensure pensioners are not surprised when these alterations occur. Firstly, the full new state pension will be increasing from £179.60 to £185.15 per week. To get the full new state pension, Britons typically need 35 years of qualifying National Insurance contributions. At least 10 years are required to get any of the new state pension at all.

Eligible pensioners are men born on or after April 6, 1951 and women born on or after April 6, 1953. Men born before April 6, 1951 and women born before April 6, 1953 will be entitled to this pension. The full basic state pension will also increase from April onwards, from £137.60 to £141.85 per week. The full basic state pension is available to those with a total of 30 qualifying years of National Insurance contributions or credits.

In some cases, women will get their qualifying years from the National Insurance record of their spouse or civil partner. The Married Woman’s Pension, for the basic state pension, also known as the Category B pension will rise. April will bring an increase to the sum from its current level of £82.45 to £85. In a similar sense, there is an over 80 pension for those aged 80 or over - currently providing £82.45 per week. To be eligible, individuals must get either a basic state pension of less than £82.45 a week, or no basic state pension at all. The Government states: “The maximum amount of Additional state pension you can get is £180.31 per week. “The limit does not include state pension top up.” This is going to rise from £180.31 to £185.90 from April onwards. The state pension triple lock has been temporarily suspended for one year due to perceived lack of affordability. Pensioners were hopeful of an eight percent rise, but this did not come to fruition. The Government decided instead to temporarily scrap the earnings component, implementing a double lock instead. It means state pensioners will observe a 3.1 percent increase this year.
