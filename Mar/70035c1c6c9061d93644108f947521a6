Between them, Help Ukraine Emergency Appeal and British-Ukrainian Aid have raked in more than £1million in online donations to buy food, medicine and shelter for civilians. The Help Ukraine bid has raised £940,000, thanks to 7,200 donors. And British-Ukrainian Aid has raised more than £131,000 towards a £200,000 target after more than 2,400 people reached out to ease the humanitarian crisis after five days of attacks by Kremlin troops.  Victims, including children, the elderly and vulnerable, are in dire need of help after losing their homes to bombing raids. Anna Dezyk, a finance official who set up Help Ukraine Emergency Appeal, said: “They are in urgent need of medical supplies and relief as they face the prospect of renewed conflict.” Anna says £70 will buy a food and hygiene pack to serve a family of four for a month, and £8 provides a couple of blankets for evacuees in shelters. A basic three-month emergency medicine pack for 1,000 people costs £1,500, while £3,700 will buy medicine for 10,000 victims. Aid partners in Ukraine have opened distribution warehouses at four locations, including Odessa. British-Ukraine Aid says 14,000 have been killed – a quarter of them civilians – since the Russian warmongering began in 2014. Another 30,000 have been wounded and more than 3.5 million need help and protection. You can donate at gofundme.com/f/helpukraine
