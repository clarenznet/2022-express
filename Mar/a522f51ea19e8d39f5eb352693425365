Several listeners raised the issue in response to Labour Party plans to change the law so that trans people can self identify their gender. Miss Rowling, an opponent of the proposal, wrote on Twitter afterwards: "Someone please send the Shadow Minister for Equalities a dictionary and a backbone.” The Harry Potter author and Labour Party supporter has been an outspoken campaigner for protecting women-only spaces such as refuges. During a discussion to mark International Women's Day, Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett asked Ms Dodds to set out "Labour's definition of a woman". Miss Dodds replied: "I have to say there are different definitions legally around what a woman actually is. You look at the definition within the Equality Act and I think it just says someone who is adult and female but then it doesn't say how you would define either of those things. You have got the biological definition, legal definition" Miss Barnett said: "With respect, I didn't ask for that. What's the Labour definition?” Miss Dodds replied: "With respect Emma, I think it does depend what the context is, surely? I mean surely that is important here. "There are people who have decided that they have to make that transition...Understandably because they live as a woman, they want to be defined as a woman; that's what the Gender Recognition Act has brought into place.” Miss Barnett interjected: "Context is all, but trans women are women from your perspective, is that right? I am just trying to clarify because the Government has been very clear, it is not going ahead in England with the process of self-identification. That is why I am asking you.” Miss Dodds is not the first senior Labour figure to have been involved in awkward exchanges over the issue. Last autumn, when quizzed on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed it was "not right" to say that only a woman can have a cervix.
