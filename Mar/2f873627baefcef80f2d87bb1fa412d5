It tweeted: "The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects." Thermobaric weapons are also called vacuum bombs because, after the initial explosion, a low-pressure zone sucks oxygen back towards the blast site from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion up to 3,000 kelvins (4,940F). Delivered by rocket or missile, they contain multiple submunitions which open mid-air and explode on impact. Hundreds can be delivered in one go. They can cause lung embolisms in humans and even vaporise entire bodies if they are too close to the bomb site. In a city, the bombs can cause huge death rates and massive destruction.
