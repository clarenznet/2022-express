Syrian refugee Mohammed Al-Aaraj, 19, and three friends had gathered in a flat block stairwell. Retired Royal Engineer Frank Fishwick, 86, who was "frustrated with the youth of today" went to confront them only to be taunted by Al-Aaraj as an "old man with no teeth". Frank responded with two racist barbs which sparked Al-Aaraj to punch him in the face - causing an internal brain haemorrhage. He died the following day in hospital. Al-Aaraj, who came to the UK aged 15, admitted manslaughter at Preston Crown Court heard and was sentenced to four years in a Young Offenders' Institution for the attack in the town on September 10. He had a previous conviction for assault and criminal damage over a road rage incident in which he had shown "sustained anger". Judge Robert Altham said Frank, who spoke to police after the attack, had regretted making the racial slurs. The judge added: "Such comments cannot begin to excuse this teenage defendant punching an 86-year-old man in the face and causing his death. "Mr Fishwick had served his country and his family speak of the good he had done throughout his life." Police bodycam footage played to the court showed Frank holding his bleeding nose. He ignored his injury at first but at 7.40pm called an ambulance as the flow would not stop. Doctors found bleeding on the brain and he died the next morning. The court heard a victim impact statement from Frank's son-in-law David Taylor-Fishwick, who lives in Virginia, US. He said: "He was an octogenarian who was cruelly intimidated and assaulted. You want the death of people you love to be dignified and peaceful and that has been taken away. "He gave 86 years of good with service to his country and his community and all of this ended for bravado." The victim's daughter Judith Taylor- Fishwick said her father had been taken from the family in "an inhuman and cruel act of violence".
