Amid the cost of living crisis, rising energy bills and skyrocketing inflation, Britons could be in for more financial turmoil than they realise. Households are urged to keep an eye on tax changes happening this year to avoid being caught out with fines or penalties for disobeying rules they weren’t aware of. Last years’ Autumn Budget saw the announcement of the CGT reporting extension affecting everyone who makes a capital gain after selling property. Previously, the deadline was just 30 days for property sellers to report the gains made on a sale and pay the taxes owed. This has been increased to 60 days, meaning anyone who sells a second home or buy-to-let property has two months to submit a residential property return to HMRC and make the necessary tax payments. This extension will only affect properties sold on or after October 27, 2021, with those who have sold a property between April 6, 2020 and October 26, 2021 still held liable to the 30 day rule.  On April 6, National Insurance rates are set to rise by 1.25 percent to help fund the Government’s plans for health and social care. This is a temporary rise which will be replaced in April 2023 by the health and social care levy which will be imposed on working pensioners too. The lower earnings limits for National Insurance contributions will also be rising by 3.1 percent with the upper earnings threshold being frozen for the time being at £50,270. Currently, class one rates are imposed on those earning between £9,568 and £50,270 per year, which will change to £9,880 and £50,270 per year. Class one contributions are currently 12 percent but will rise to 13.25 percent but for those earning over the upper threshold will see a rise from two percent to 3.25 percent.    These rates are also due to rise by 1.25 percent in April, meaning investors that earn money from company shares above the unchanging threshold of £2,000 will need to pay tax depending on their income tax band. Those on the basic rate tax band will pay 8.75 percent instead of 7.5 percent, and higher rate earnings will pay 33.75 percent instead of the current 32.5 percent. Additional rate taxpayers will also see their rates climb from 38.1 percent to 39.35 percent. The Scottish parliament announced its draft budget in December 2021 which proposed an increased income tax threshold to take effect in April 2022. The personal allowance will remain at £12,570 with workers earning less than this paying no income tax. The upper threshold for starter rates will rise from £14,667 to £14,732 with workers earning between the personal allowance threshold and this amount paying 19 percent income tax. Similarly, the basic rate will change from between £14,667 - £25,297 to £14,732 - £25,689 and the intermediate rate will follow suit, going from £25,297 - £43,663 to £25,689 to £43,663. The higher rate and top rate thresholds will remain unchanged. The new rule for inheritance tax (IHT) reporting came into effect at the beginning of 2022, concerning a change in how ‘excepted estates’ are classed. The rule change now means that excepted estates will not require heirs to report the estate’s value as long as no IHT is due and there is no other reason for it to be reported. For an estate to count as excepted after January 1, 2022, it must:
