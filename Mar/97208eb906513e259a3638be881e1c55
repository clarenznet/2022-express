The Duke of Cambridge, 39, was out on royal duties this week as he visited Wales with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, 40. The couple showed off their baking skills at a youth centre during the trip, which was to celebrate St David's Day. William rolled out some dough and cut it out in the kitchen at The Hwb Torfaen in Blaenavon. The Duke quipped to the group of youngsters watching him cook: “I'm under a lot of pressure here. Dr Robert Morris from University College London’s Constitution Unit discussed the Queen’s succession with Express.co.uk. When asked if William will simply take over as Prince of Wales when Charles accedes to the throne, he said: “Yes, but that’s not automatic. “But we expect that Prince Charles would make that change very quickly. “Of course, he’s not a minor as Charles had been. Charles was made Prince of Wales in 1969 when he reached his maturity. “I imagine that will all be done pretty quickly.” Charles’ Duchy of Cornwall – which is inherited by the monarch’s eldest son – will be transferred to William. The Duchy was established by Edward III in 1337 to give his son and heir an independent source of income. Dr Morris explained how Charles will instead take on the Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate belonging to the sovereign. He said: “There is all sorts of money involved in all this because Charles would give up the Duchy of Cornwall and that would pass to William. “But Charles would take an exchange as it were. He would take on the Duchy of Lancaster revenues, which are part of the Privy Purse. “It’s the resource from which the Queen pays other members of the Royal Family who are active on royal duties. “Both sources of revenue bring in about £20million a year each.”
