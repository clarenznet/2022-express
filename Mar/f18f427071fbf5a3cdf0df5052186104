Manchester United are reportedly one of several clubs with a desire to land Napoli forward Victor Osimhen before the end of the season. The Red Devils are said to be weighing up a move for a new first-choice striker to replace Edinson Cavani at Old Trafford upon the expiry of his contract in the summer. The Uruguayan marksman will be a free agent in the summer as things stand and is not expected to sign a new deal between now and the end of the season.Meanwhile, there are also questions over the immediate future of Cristiano Ronaldo, who is said to be open to the idea of leaving United if they miss out on a top-four finish in the Premier League over the coming months.The 37-year-old was visibly frustrated after United's home draw with Watford on Saturday and is said to have doubts over the ability of Ralf Rangnick as he looks to secure Champions League qualification ahead of next season.It seems as though United will be looking to recruit at least one new forward in the summer window if Cavani is allowed to leave as expected or Ronaldo opts to seek a fresh challenge elsewhere.A number of high-profile names have been linked with the Red Devils as of late, including the likes of England skipper Harry Kane and Borussia Dortmund talisman Erling Haaland. JUST IN: Man Utd boss Ralf Rangnick 'has made mind up' about Cristiano Ronaldo Osimhen has also been mentioned in connection with United after turning plenty of heads with a string of impressive performances in Serie A for Napoli.The Nigeria international has chipped in with 11 goals in all competitions since the beginning of the campaign and looks set to be in high demand when the transfer window re-opens in the summer.He was initially named in the Nigeria squad for this year's Africa Cup of Nations after scoring five times in six matches to help the Super Eagles book their place at the tournament.However, he failed to play a single minute at the tournament after suffering a cheekbone injury prior to his side's first match. It seems as though United could benefit from keeping Ronaldo in their efforts to land Osimhen, who previously spoke of his admiration for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner before his move to Juventus back in 2018."Playing against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo is something one can eagerly await, so I'm looking forward to facing him soon," he told CAF Online.It remains to be seen whether Osimhen will eventually link up with Ronaldo at Old Trafford if United manage to secure his services at the end of the season.Recent reports have suggested that Napoli could decide to cash in for a fee in the region of £70million if a suitable offer is tabled over the summer months.
