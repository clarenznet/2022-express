Kristen Stewart, 31, wore a long sheer black and white gown to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival as she accepted her award. The revealing gown featured monochrome feathering and black sequins. Her toned stomach was exposed in the number, as well as her leg, due to the daring thigh split in the dress. She wore her brunette tresses in a high ponytail, making sure not to take attention away from her dress. Kristen showed off her glamorous side with a full face of make-up, featuring a rose lip and peach toned cheeks. The Oscar-nominated star was the recipient of the prestigious American Riviera Award at the 37th annual event. The award recognises talent for outstanding achievement in American Film. At the star-studded event, Kristen posed with executive director Roger Durling and fellow actress Charlize Theron. Last week, Kristen also accepted the Best Actress gong for her spot-on portrayal of Princess Diana in Pablo Larraín's Spencer at the annual Hollywood Critics Association (HCA) Film Awards. She told the audience: "I took more joy into my body doing this than anything…. It’s been a long run, I f*****g appreciate this, seriously."
