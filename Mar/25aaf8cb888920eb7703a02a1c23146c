The United Kingdom is a welcoming and friendly place to live, and a great place to brush up on your English language skills too. Every Ukrainian arriving in the UK will be given access to free language classes, whether you're a total beginner or you already speak some English to an intermediate level. If you already know some English, just being around English speaking people will help you to develop your skills. Why not go for a coffee or for a drink with your host to practice your conversational skills? Or watch the television or listen to the radio in order to develop your listening skills? You could also join your local library and take out some books to brush up on your reading. Lil Bremermann-Richard, Group Chief Executive Officer of Oxford International, said: “Yes, we’ve developed an entirely online process that means people who have some working proficiency with English can get free access to a virtual learning campus where they can meet and see their tutor and access their English language results online. “Learning any language can be challenging at first, but we’ve found our students can find it just as easy to learn online as in person. "During the pandemic we adapted our teaching so students can access it from wherever they are located. All content and classes of our free course for refugees will be easily available online through any smartphone, tablet, or laptop. It’s the same academic rigour but with more flexibility. “We already work with 42 different partners in including most UK universities and it’s a proven and tested model we use with our usual students seeking places in higher education.”
