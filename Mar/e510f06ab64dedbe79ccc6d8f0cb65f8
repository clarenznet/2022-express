If you're trying and failing to log into your NatWest bank account this morning then you are not alone. The firm's app appears to be down with customers reporting that they can't access their accounts via their smartphones. The issue began at around 8:45 am with the problems still ongoing. Images posted online show customers are being met with a message that reads, "Sorry, some kind of error has occurred when trying to establish a connection between your device and ourselves." The bug seems to be pretty widespread with online outage monitor, Down Detector, is currently showing over 1,000 reports and Twitter is also alive with users complaining about the banking outage. Speaking on social media, one user named Jenny tweeted, "@NatWest_Help are there issues with mobile banking app can't connect even on WiFi." Whilst another called Amber added: "@NatWest_Help Bit of a nightmare with the app this morning...any updates on when you expect this to be resolved? Thanks." There's no word on what is causing the issues or when things will be back online but the bank has responded to customers saying that they are aware of the online problems. In a post on Twitter NatWest said: "This is a recent incident that has just occurred, rest assured we will get the issue resolved ASAP so please try again in a little while or use our telephony service to manage your finances."
