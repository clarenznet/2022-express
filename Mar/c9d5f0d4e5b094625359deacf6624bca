The former Brexit minister and Mayor of Manchester engaged in a Twitter spat over Net Zero aims which would end all carbon emissions by 2050. The war in Ukraine has reopened the debate over whether the UK should allow fracking again to use natural gas to heat people’s homes. Currently, 3 percent of Britain’s gas supplies come from Russia and the Government wants to reduce that to zero. But Mr Burnham took to Twitter opposing the idea. He said: “Don’t listen to them. Fracking is not the future. It delays it.” It provoked a furious response from Lord Frost who hit back: “I guess it depends what you think the future is. “If you think it is expensive and unreliable power supplies plus rationing, then I agree that UK shale gas certainly delays that.” Lord Frost resigned from the Government over his anger with Boris Johnson capitulsating to the Net Zero lobby which will see householders have to fork out as much as £20,000 on new heating systems which do not use gas by 2035. Fracking for natural gas has been fiercely opposed but the green lobby in Britain but was supported by David Cameron’s government. There have also been concerns about UK geology not supporting it but natural gas is seen as a plentiful cheap supply for energy. What is happening where you live?

Wading into the debate, fellow Tory peer Baroness Foster replied on Twitter to Mr Burnham: “I take it you can afford the huge increase in your energy bills & you’re not too fussed about ‘energy security’ !!! Fracking delays nothing .. It can provide a huge amount of our energy supply in the future along with nuclear - oil & gas & renewables ! Simple !!”
