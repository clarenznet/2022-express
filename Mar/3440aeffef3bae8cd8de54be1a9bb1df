Many British people decide to move abroad as expats. Relocating can be expensive but what if countries paid people to move? Spain is one of the UK’s most popular holiday destinations and many Britons dream of a life in the sun. The beautiful town of Ponga in Asturias will pay people 3,000 euros (£2,517) to settle there and another £2,517 for every baby born in the town. In recent years, Ponga and other rural towns have suffered an exodus as people decide to relocate to Spain’s cities. This means that several towns are willing to pay people to move there and rejuvenate the area.

The town will supplement a new resident’s income with an extra 100-150 euros (£83-£125) per month. Offering some of Europe’s best beaches, countryside and cuisine, Italy is a fantastic destination for British expats. Much like Spain, some towns and villages have lost residents to cities in recent years and are willing to pay people to entice them to relocate. Britons could opt to move to stunning Candela in Italy’s Apulia region where single people receive 800 euros (£671) and couples 1,200 euros (£1,006). Expats must apply for formal residency in Candela to qualify for the attractive scheme and payments. Calabria, the toe of Italy’s boot, has recently joined the scheme. Expats must be under 40 to apply but the scheme is extremely attractive. New residents will be given 800 to 1,000 euros (£671-£839) per month for two to three years. That adds up to a whopping £23,502-£27,689 over three years. Switzerland’s scheme is a little more complicated as expats will have to be Swiss residents to apply. However, the beautiful remote village of Albinen will offer people $25,200 (£19,111) to move there. Residents will need to stay for a minimum of 10 years but that won’t be hard once they’ve experienced the fresh Alpine air. Switzerland has some of the highest expat salaries in the world and plenty of opportunities in the finance sector. Dreaming of getting back to nature? Alaska will pay people to relocate to its rugged landscape. Alaska will pay people around $1,600 (£1,213) a year as part of the Permanent Fund Dividend for residents. Newton, in the US state of Iowa, will offer anyone who buys a home worth over $190,000 (£144,095), $10,000 (£7,583) as a welcome. Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Kansas and Tennessee also offer financial bonuses for new residents.
