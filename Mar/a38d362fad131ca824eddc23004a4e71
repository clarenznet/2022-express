FA Cup action is back underway this week as teams big and small vie for a spot in the quarter-finals. With three places in the last eight already decided, more clashes are set for Wednesday and Thursday with quarter-final ties scheduled to take place between March 18 and March 21. On Tuesday evening, Manchester City battled past Peterborough United 2-0 at the Weston Homes Stadium, while Crystal Palace edged out Stoke City 2-1 at home. The big shock was dished out by Middlesbrough, who built on their sensational win over Manchester United at Old Trafford with an extra-time triumph over Tottenham at the Riverside. Chelsea and Liverpool, both among the tournament favourites, are still in with a shout of making the quarters, while Boreham Wood fans are gearing up for a blockbuster trip to face Everton at Goodison Park. With no FA Cup replays in force, matches will go straight to extra-time and penalties if still level after 90 minutes.
