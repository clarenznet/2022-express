The Queen renewed the pledge she made to the UK and the Commonwealth aged only 21 in a newly-released message to the 54-strong union. At the time, the monarch vowed to dedicate her whole life to service. In her new message, shared by Buckingham Palace just minutes before the beginning of the Commonwealth Day service, the Queen said: "In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in 1947, that my life will always be devoted in service." The Queen continued: "Today, it is rewarding to observe a modem, vibrant and connected Commonwealth that combines a wealth of history and tradition with the great social, cultural and technological advances of our time. "That the Commonwealth stands ever taller is a credit to all who have been involved. "We are nourished and sustained by our relationships and, throughout my life, I have enjoyed the privilege of hearing what the relationships built across the great reach and diversity of the Commonwealth have meant to people and communities.

"It is a place to come together to pursue common goals and the common good, providing everyone with the opportunity to serve and benefit. "In these testing times, it is my hope that you can draw strength and inspiration from what we share, as we work together towards a healthy, sustainable and prosperous future for all. "And on this special day for our family — in a year that will include the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the Commonwealth Games — I hope we can deepen our resolve to support and serve one another, and endeavour to ensure the Commonwealth remains an influential force for good in our world for many generations to come."
