Scott Kitching, from West Lothain, visited Dobbies, a garden centre in Livingston, with his partner and their dog on Saturday. While visiting, Mr Kitching decided to buy a meal for him, “his good lady” and their dog but was left outraged after the tiny portion. Mr Kitching ordered a chicken nuggets kids meal from the café at the popular garden centre which was supposed to include a portion of chips or mash with some garden peas. When he looked at his receipt, he found he had been charged £5.20 for just five chicken nuggets with no chips or peas. The West Lothian man said Dobbies is usually good value, but the price felt like a rip off. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Mr Kitching said: “I went to Dobbies with my good lady and wanted to get a wee chicken nuggets kids meal for the dog. “But when the order came all I got was a bowl of five nuggets, with no chips or peas. “My plan was to eat the chips and peas whilst the dog had the nuggets. “I did not realise the price until I looked at the receipt later. I was expecting maybe £2-3 as their mains tend to be around £7 for an adult but could not believe they charged me £5.20 for just five nuggets.

It was not a meal that they gave me, even though they advertised it as such. “We understand they have to put a mark up on things but you can go out and get 30 chicken nuggets for about £1.50 from Aldi. “At McDonald’s you can get a pocket of chips and juice for less than what Dobbies charged. “Folk are struggling for money at the moment and £5.20 for a kids meal is just madness.” A spokesperson for Dobbies said: “We’re sorry to hear Mr Kitching wasn’t happy with his children’s meal. ‘Our children’s meals are normally served with peas, chips or mash and a drink. “We’d be delighted to welcome Mr Kitching back into the store to enjoy the full meal on us.”
