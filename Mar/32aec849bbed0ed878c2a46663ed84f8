In the 31st day of Russia’s war against Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s troops continue to conduct a full-scale aggression in the Eastern European country. On Saturday, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence released a photo of a Holocaust Memorial in Drobitsky Yar, a ravine on the outskirts of Kharkiv. In the photo, the Memorial looks damaged, with broken and missing parts laying on the ground. The Ministry commented: “Russian invaders fired on and damaged the Holocaust Memorial.” And added: “The Nazis have returned. Exactly 80 years later.” At the end of the post by the official Twitter account of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Naftali Bennett, the Prime Minister of Israel is tagged. The Prime Minister of Israel hasn’t publicly responded so far. The Drobitsky Yar is one of the numerous massacre sites of the Second World War. The Drobitsky Memorial was built in remembrance of approximately 16,000 people, mainly Jews, who were killed there in December 1941 by Nazi troops invading the Soviet Union. Children were thrown into pits alive, to save bullets, in the expectation that they would quickly freeze to death since the temperature was at -15°C. One month later, Putin’s troops have been continuously shelling residential areas, targeting hospitals, and killing innocent civilians, including children. More than 10 million Ukrainian people have been displaced, according to the UN, in what amounts to a huge humanitarian catastrophe. More than 3.7 million people have left their homes and are seeking shelter outside of their country, as refugees in other countries including Poland and Romania. Finally, the UN reported that more than 1,000 innocent civilians, including children, have lost their lives so far in this war.
