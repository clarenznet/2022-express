British Airways said “operational issues” at the airport on Saturday were behind the cancellation of more than 25 flights as well as many delays. Some customers hit by cancellations then had trouble getting hold of the airline yesterday. Steve Regis tweeted: “The home of BA, where they leave you stranded after missing a flight connection, where the only BA rep says ‘not my problem, I’m going home, call this number’, but they won’t answer because it’s closed.” BA said they were offering full refunds to some passengers, while Heathrow apologised that Border Force had experienced “delays processing passengers”. Last month more than 500 BA flights were cancelled or delayed due to a major IT issue.
