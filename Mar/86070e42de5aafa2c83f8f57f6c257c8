The royal couple shared incredible images of the daring dive during their eight-day Caribbean tour before heading to Jamaica. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got up close and personal with the sea creatures at South Water Caye and uploaded a stunning underwater video on social media. It showed them leaping into crystal clear blue waters in their diving gear before exploring the second-largest reef in the world. William, 39, is seen gesturing an "OK" sign to Kate, 40, before she comes within touching distance of a 3ft nurse shark. They said their experience was a "privilege" and alongside the clip, they wrote: "While the effects of climate change are evident, the government of Belize and communities across the country deserve huge recognition for their efforts to restore this incredible marine environment - with a commitment to protect 30 per cent of it by 2030. It was a privilege to see for ourselves the world-leading ocean conservation work being done here." Meanwhile, the duchess dazzled as she arrived in Jamaica on the next leg of their trip, wearing a bright shade of yellow that features in their host's flag. A beaming Kate struggled to control her Roksanda dress in the wind as William took the salute from a guard of honour. The couple later met Jamaicanborn Manchester City footballer Raheem Sterling and other sporting stars.
