Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick has suggested that Thomas Tuchel is unlikely to become the club's next permanent manager amid the current uncertainty at Chelsea. The Blues boss has been linked with the upcoming vacancy at Old Trafford in recent days after Roman Abramovich, who has owned the European champions since 2003, was hit with a number of government sanctions on Thursday. Chelsea are now unable to sell match-day tickets, merchandise or renegotiate contracts under the new measures.Tuchel played under Rangnick's management at German club Ulm and also worked under the United boss during his time as a youth team coach at Stuttgart.However, Rangnick was adamant that any rumours about Tuchel joining United in the summer were unfounded when quizzed on the topic in Friday's press conference."It doesn’t make sense at all to even think or speculate about that," he said."Yes, Thomas Tuchel is a top manager, yes, I know him well, yes he was a player of mine in Ulm, yes, he took his first job as a football coach in Stuttgart when I was the head coach.

United will seemingly be forced to look elsewhere in their search for a new manager, with Mauricio Pochettino and Erik Ten Hag said to be among the most likely candidates in the frame to replace Rangnick in the summer.However, Jamie Carragher recently insisted that Tuchel would be the ideal man to take charge at Old Trafford if he can be tempted to walk away from Chelsea over the coming months."Given the events at Chelsea, United’s decision to wait until the end of the season presents them with a choice no one could have foreseen," wrote Carragher in his column for The Telegraph."One of the best managers in the world, the current Fifa coach of the year, must be top of their list.

If he gets the chance to leave for a club of United’s stature, he must take it."United can offer him the security and backing every top coach craves. Yes, it will seem a predatory move taking advantage of Chelsea’s crisis."But from United and Tuchel’s perspective, the more you consider it, the more of a no-brainer it is."Every chief executive in the world looking for a new coach will be, or at least should be, monitoring Tuchel’s mood and public comments between now and the end of the season."Only clubs of a certain calibre could attract him. It would be negligent of United to fail to sound him out. As a coach, he is exactly what they need." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport?
