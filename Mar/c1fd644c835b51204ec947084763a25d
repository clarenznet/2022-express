The Rolling Stones legend Ronnie Wood, 74, couldn't keep his hands off his wife Sally Wood, 44, who is 30 years his junior. The couple looked loved-up as they led the celebrity arrivals at the charity event. Ronnie was pictured planting a kiss on his wife's cheek as the pair posed for pictures ahead of the event. The rocker looked dapper as he sported a metallic leopard print jacket, which he wore over a white shirt. Ronnie teamed his look with a pair of black trousers and cream trainers. The musician wrapped his arm affectionately around the waist of his other half as the couple beamed at the cameras. Sally looked chic in a pretty ivory ruffled mini dress, with floaty cropped sleeves and glitzy detailing all over. She accessorised her look with a pair of jewelled wedges, which elongated her petite frame, and a red locket pendant necklace. Ronnie's wife opted for bold makeup, including a grey smokey eye, bright red lipstick, as her brunette tresses cascaded down past her shoulders. Other celebrities who attended the event included actress Sadie Frost and singer Andrea Corr, the lead singer of the popular group The Corrs. Later in the evening, Ronnie took to the stage where he performed a duet with the Irish-born crooner.
