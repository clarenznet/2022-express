Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta was keen to cast an eye over six of the club's brightest young academy stars as the Gunners romped to a 4-1 win over Brentford B at London Colney. The discreet fixture was arranged with the view of bolstering the squad's fitness levels ahead of club football's return this weekend. The majority of Arsenal's first-team squad are currently away on international duty with their countries. Others stayed behind in north London recharging the batteries before returning to training this week. Arteta was keen to use some of the time wisely to take a closer look at some of his other options ahead of the run-in. Young guns Zak Swanson, Mazeed Ogungbo, Miguel Azeez, Charlie Patino, Charles Sagoe Jr and Bradley Ibrahim were all handed starts alongside a number of first-team players.
