The Queen and Prince Philip welcomed their fourth and final child, Prince Edward, on March 10, 1964. Prince Edward is known to have had a close relationship with both his parents, having been entrusted by his late father to continue his legacy with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. Edward is also thought to be a great support to the Queen following Philip's death last year, as he lives only a short drive from Windsor Castle at his Bagshot Park residence.
