Mr Zelensky will address UK MPs on the 13th day of Russian attacks on his country via video link from Kyiv at 5pm, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle confirmed as he called the appointment a "historic moment". Sir Lindsay said: "Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president, who will be speaking to us live from Ukraine, so this is an important opportunity for the House. "Thanks again to our incredible staff for working at pace to make this historic address possible." Formal business in the Commons will be suspended so MPs can listen to the president's speech with the help of simultaneous translation provided over headsets. The announcement of the address, which it is thought Mr Zelensky will use to ask for more arms and to insist on the instigation of a no-fly zone, comes amid Prime Minister Boris Johnson's participation in talks with leaders on Monday about the ongoing war in Ukraine.

According to the White House, the four leaders "affirmed their determination to continue raising the costs on Russia for its unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine" and stressed "their commitment to continue providing security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine". The Prime Minister also posted a video on Twitter alongside Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau and Dutch leader Mark Rutte in which they shared a message of unity. He said: "We stand together with the people of Ukraine in the face of the aggression that they are suffering at the hands of Vladimir Putin and Russia." At a Downing Street news conference following this, the three leaders discussed new sanctions against Moscow and aid for Kyiv. Mr Johnson said a boycott of Russian oil and gas was "very much on the table" – echoing claims by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken over the weekend that Washington was in "very active discussions" with European nations over the matter. While emphasising the Government was not abandoning its commitment to cut carbon emissions, the Prime Minister said he would set out a new energy supply strategy in the coming days. While the UK receives less than five percent of its gas from Russia, he said the possibility of using even more of its own fossil fuels was being explored. Mr Johnson also announced another £175million of UK support for Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky said in a video address shared on social media on Sunday: "We repeat every day: close the sky over Ukraine. Close for all Russian missiles, for Russian combat aircraft, for all their terrorists. "If you don't, if you don't give us at least planes so we can protect ourselves, there's only one thing to conclude; you want us to be killed very slowly." According to Ukrainian sources, calling for a no-fly air zone is Mr Zelensky's priority in Tuesday's address. An official said: "This is the No 1 issue for us. Crucial and vital." Imposing a no-fly zone was ruled out by the UK and NATO due to fears it could lead to an escalation between Russia and the West. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News on Sunday: "We're not going to get ourselves into a direct military conflict with Putin because that would be a massive escalation, but also that feeds Putin’s narrative." Mr Johnson did however promise the Ukrainian leader in a phone call to secure more "defensive equipment" — including anti-tank and anti-air missiles — for the country's army. No 10 said: "The Prime Minister and President Zelensky also discussed the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, precipitated by Russia's indiscriminate attacks and ceasefire breaches."
