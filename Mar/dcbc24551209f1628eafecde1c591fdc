Manchester United might have managed to tie Bruno Fernandes down to a new contract but his wages still mean he is not even in the top five earners at Old Trafford. The Portugal international has penned a five-year deal that will be announced after the international break. Fernandes remains some way behind being the top earner at the club despite a new five-year contract being agreed. There is no doubting the importance to the squad that the playmaker brings to the team. However, despite this being a more difficult season, the former Sporting Lisbon player will have to make do with being the seventh-highest earner at Old Trafford. That is because the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, David de Gea, Paul Pogba, Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho and Edinson Cavani are all ahead of him. Cristiano Ronaldo has the largest contract at United - and indeed the Premier League - taking home a cool £500,000-a-week in a staggering two-year deal that has an option for a third. While De Gea is the best-paid goalkeeper on the planet on £375,000-a-week. Fernandes will hardly be scraping for pennies with his new deal but it might come as a surprise to hear that he will not be included in the upper echelons of United's pay structure. His new five-year contract has effectively doubled his money. Whereas before the 27-year-old was making £120,000-a-week - the same as Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic - he has now doubled his money to £240,000-a-week, report the Telegraph. This puts the Portuguese star seventh in the list of highest earners at the club, behind Cavani who lands £250,000-a-week. Despite the refusal to make him one of their biggest earners, United have been desperate to tie Fernandes down to a new contract. And the midfielder was also keen to stay at Old Trafford, who had a blistering start to his career with the Red Devils. After signing in January 2020, his eight goals in 14 Premier League appearances ultimately shot United into a Champions League spot while the following year he netted 28 in all competitions. It has been a tougher ask this year round, though, with just nine in 37 matches, but his importance to the team cannot be understated. And United wanted to make a point of showing him that they still regard him as an integral part of their future. Whoever comes in as manager this summer will have the extra task of getting the best out of a player that can be a vital cog in the team. Several candidates have been tipped to take the job. Ajax coach Erik ten Hag was interviewed earlier this week while Mauricio Pochettino remains the favourite to succeed. Other managers linked include Julen Lopetegui, Luis Enrique and Thomas Tuchel.
