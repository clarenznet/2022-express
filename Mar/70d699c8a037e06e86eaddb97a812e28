The actor and dad of three, 45, also thanked “a bunch of reprobates” – friends who he said would “love to be here to take the p*** out of me”. He said: “I’m British so part of me is finding this incredibly painful. The other part of me is quite enjoying this massive ego stroke.” Turning to his wife, theatre director Sophie Hunter, he continued: “Your support, your honesty, searing at times as it is, your style, your grace, your beauty, your generosity and your love are extraordinary. “I’m really enjoying this but it wouldn’t be half the ride if I was on my own without you as it is with you.” He added that they had created an “amazing family of three extraordinary human beings” and also thanked his sons for keeping him grounded by calling him a “stupid fart-face”. “One day, in disguises, maybe we’ll sneak out here and have a little photograph all together on daddy’s star,” he said. “But you’re my little stars and I adore you.” The London-born Sherlock star was presented with the accolade by Star Wars director JJ Abrams and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige on Monday. His co-star in his new Netflix film, The Power Of The Dog, Kodi Smit McPhee, also attended the ceremony. Cumberbatch is tipped to win best actor gongs at both the Oscars and the Baftas for his role as rancher Phil Burbank in Jane Campion’s dark Western. The star was also nominated at Sunday’s Screen Actors Guild awards but lost out to Will Smith. Cumberbatch will also be back on the big screen in May after reprising his role as superhero wizard Doctor Stephen Strange in Marvel blockbuster The Multiverse Of Madness. The actor’s star is the 2,714th on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
