Universal Credit is a payment to help with living costs for those on a low income, out of work, or unable to work. PIP, however, assists with living costs for people living with a health condition or disability. As both payments are important, understanding when they will be issued is key. There is an important change taking place next month which could impact the payment dates of many claimants. The alteration is as a result of the upcoming Easter bank holiday which will potentially have an impact on when a person gets paid. This year, Good Friday falls on April 15, and Easter Monday the following week on April 18.

The Government has said individuals “might be paid earlier if your normal payment day is a bank holiday”. The last working day before the Easter weekend is Thursday, April 14. As such, Britons expecting payment on Good Friday or Easter Monday can expect to be paid then. The rates for both Universal Credit and PIP will also be increasing next month, as it is the start of a new tax year.
