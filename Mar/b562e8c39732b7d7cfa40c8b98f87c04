Show chiefs yesterday said the daytime drama - a staple on UK TV for more than 30 years - will end after it lost its British broadcaster and failed to find alternative funding. The programme helped launch the careers of many stars, including Minogue's when she joined in 1986 playing Charlene Mitchell. Kylie, now 53, paid tribute to the soap on Twitter, writing: "I'll be forever grateful for the experience & the friends I made on @neighbours. "We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart. Pure love! I can still hear Madge calling ... CHARLENE!!!!" The show about the residents of Ramsay Street also helped actors such as Jason Donovan, Natalie Imbruglia, Margot Robbie and even Russell Crowe find fame. The future of Australia's longest running drama series became in doubt after Channel 5 last month said it would stop airing it. And yesterday, the soap's Twitter account said: "We are so sorry to say that after nearly 37 years and almost 9,000 episodes broadcast we have to confirm that Neighbours will cease production in June." Channel 5 said the funding will be diverted to original UK dramas.
