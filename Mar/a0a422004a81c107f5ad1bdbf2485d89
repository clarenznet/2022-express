National Highways has warned drivers to expect delays as two lanes had to close for recovery work, following the collision. The severe delays of up to two hours are seen on the M25 anti-clockwise in Surrey. According to National Highways, the collision occurred in closing lane 1 (of 4) between J8, at Reigate and J7 (M23). Apart from a collision, two vehicles also broke down on M25 on Wednesday evening. Emergency services including Surrey Police, Fire & Rescue and Ambulance Service have rushed on the spot to assist. Resources of National Highways are also on the spot, assisting with traffic management. The incidents are causing approximately eight miles of congestion from J9, at Leatherhead, adding at least two hours to normal journey times. Only one lane remains closed at the moment, however it is not known when the delays are expected to improve. National Highways said: "Delays are severe due to the initial response of the emergency services requiring multiple lanes to be closed to traffic." They added: "Please allow plenty of extra journey time for journeys along the M25 anti-clockwise in Surrey or in the local area. "You may wish to consider alternative routes or to delay your journey."
