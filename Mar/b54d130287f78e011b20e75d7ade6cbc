The event is backed by politicians, including Boris Johnson, and celebrities, including Downton Abbey star Jim Carter. And it will hit home for YouTube star Danny Malin who lost his long-term partner Carrie in February last year. The Rate My Takeaway frontman, 42, said: "When Carrie passed away I found the grief unbearable. It left me lost. Not a day goes by I don't shed a tear. "But I believe talking about Carrie and what has happened helps me keep focused on my children and building our future. "We need more love. We cannot help everyone - but everyone can help someone." More than 350 organisations are taking part today, including emergency services, charities, businesses, community groups, schools, faith leaders and bereaved families. There will be a minute's silence at midday and walls of reflection acting as community spaces where people can share thoughts about loved ones who have died. End-of-life charity Marie Curie is leading events. Chief Nurse Julie Pearce said: "Several million people are still living with the trauma of loss and not being able to grieve properly. "Let's take time to connect and show support for the millions of people who are grieving, and remember the family, friends, neighbours and colleagues we have lost over the last two years."
