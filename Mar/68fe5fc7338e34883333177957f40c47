Crufts 2022, also known as The World's Greatest Dog Show, has entered its third day - with a range of competition, display and general dog based fun.

The finale, and most anticipated prize of Best in Show, will take place on Sunday. Dogs compete in a range of contests including dog agility, obedience, flyball and heelwork to music.

This year's competition will feel even more exciting for competitors, as Crufts was cancelled last year due to the Covid pandemic. The Kennel Club announced the cancellation on its website writing: "It is with deep regret that The Kennel Club has decided to cancel Crufts 2021, which was due to take place from 15 – 18 July. "This is owing to ongoing uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic and in consideration for the health and safety of all its volunteers, judges, exhibitors, sponsors, trade stand holders, visitors and staff." However, now the show is back, with more than 20,000 competitors alongside hundreds of thousands of visitors. 8:45am - Crufts international invitation large jumping 9:30am - Scruffts semi-final 10:30am - Hearing dogs 40th anniversary 10:50am - Lowland search and rescue 11:20am - Southern Golden Retriever display team 11:40am - Medical detection dogs display 12:00pm - BREAK 12:30pm - Heelwork to music freestyle international competition 1:55pm - West Midlands police display 2:25pm - Agility international invitation large (agility) 3:10pm - Young Kennel Club agility dog of the year finals 3:55pm - Flyball team semi-finals (including Young Kennel Club flyball) 4:45pm - BREAK 5:15pm - Agility international invitation large agility finals 6:00pm - Heelwork to music freestyle international winner 6:05pm - Scruffts final 6:20pm - Obedience champion (dog) and reserve (dog) display 6:45pm - Group judging (utility) and presentation 7:35pm - Group judging (toy) and presentation 8:25pm - Programme ends
