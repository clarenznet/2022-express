Damage to overhead wires means no trains are arriving at or leaving from Birmingham New Street station for the forseeable future. Delays could affect scores of passengers who were expecting to use services to get to Resorts World Birmingham for the concert for Ukraine - starring Ed Sheeran and Camilla Cabello - which is still expected to go ahead tonight. Train tickets are being accepted on bus routes in the city, operated by National Express West Midlands, Birmingham Live reports. But the station in the heart of the city is crowded with confused commuters scrambling to get home. Birmingham New Street tweeted: "Major disruption at Birmingham New Street. "Damage to the overhead wires means that no trains will be able to run into or out of the station." It encourages passengers to follow updates on the Twitter page @NetworkRailBHM.  Services frequently leave Birmingham, and go through the hub, to London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and other major cities. Avanti West Coast, which runs many of these services, has advised passengers to follow updates on its website. But commuters shared their anger on social media. "No trains at all? That's mad," wrote one man. "How am I meant to get home?" reads another comment. It comes days after authorities in Birmingham suspended its tram network indefinitely due to "bodywork cracks".
