Although overall the UK is a safer place to drive than in previous years, new figures suggest that men are far more likely to be responsible for causing an accident than female drivers and especially in the 24-32 age group. That’s according to a study by drivers education company Zutobi who analysed the road statistics for 2020, the latest year numbers were made available. Although the number of casualties from road incidents has decreased, the likelihood of the most at-risk groups being involved in a crash has increased. In 2019 men made up 59.6 percent of all road casualties and in 2020 the figure rose to 62.6 percent. And in 2019 those aged 25-34 accounted for 21.4 percent of all road casualties, while in 2020 the number rose to 22.6 percent.

Elsewhere in the study, Kingston upon Hull was named the most dangerous driving area in the country. The Yorkshire city is home to the highest number of road accidents out of all areas in the UK. There were a total of 603 accidents in Hull in 2020, which is 232.1 accidents per 100,000 people. Portsmouth was second in the list with 198.7 accidents per 100,000 people and Surrey was third with 195.1. All the data was sourced from the Department for Transport’s road traffic statistics. The figures relate solely to incidents where at least one person was injured. With national lockdowns resulting in fewer people on the roads, there was an overall decrease in accidents and fatal injuries in 2020. There were 37,574 fewer people in the UK injured in road traffic collisions than in 2019. However, the statistics confirm that of the 603 crashes reported in Hull during 2020, only 107 were classed as serious, which is when at least one person is seriously injured but no person is killed. Overall there were 116 casualties in the 603 collisions which fell into the classification of killed or seriously injured. This classification covers anyone that requires medical treatment following a collision and is the metric council's use to judge road safety. Incidents rated as 'slight', which make up the majority of the collisions, do not result in anyone requiring medical help. Hull Councillor Dean Kirk, portfolio holder for transportation, roads and highways said: "Hull, like all other local authorities nationally concentrate on serious KSI's (where someone has been killed or seriously injured), and not 'slights'. "Slights makeup 86 percent of incidents - so the table does not represent the reality in Hull. “Hull City Council has been investing heavily in road infrastructure in Hull to maintain and improve the safety for all users. "By working in partnership with the local Humber authorities and Safer Roads Humber, the amount of KSIs in Hull have been decreasing and we are working hard to ensure this continues.”
