Dame Judi, 87, loved the chance to take part in French and Saunders's skit on the BBC One show for tonight's charity fund-raising event – and even brought in two items for mending. The Oscar-winning icon posed for a selfie with Dawn French, 64, and Jennifer Saunders, 67, and was snapped with her actress daughter Finty Williams, 49. French and Saunders said they are such huge fans of The Repair Shop, hosted by Jay Blades, that it took them just "two seconds" to write the sketch. But they reckon Judi is an even bigger fan of Jay Blades. Speaking on set, Dawn said: "You're going to have to rescue Jay Blades at the end of the day from Judi's clutches - then we'll be next in line!" Jay, 52, later tweeted: "Look who I had the pleasure of working with. Still can't believe it." • Red Nose Day is on BBC One, from 7pm, tonight.
