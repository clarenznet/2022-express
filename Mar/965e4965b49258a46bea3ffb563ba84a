Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is set to speak at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington DC on Thursday where she will urge world leaders to be “tough” on aggressors. This comes as the brutal invasion of Ukraine enters its 15th day.   Ms Truss, who has been in the US since Wednesday when she met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, is expected to say: “How we respond today will set the pattern for this new era. “We must start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strength, and we must start by working together to stop Putin's offensive in Ukraine. “We must rise to this moment. We must pledge that never again will we allow such aggression to grow unchecked. “That means acting now. It means being tough - because we know that the costs will only rise if we don't.

This comes as Boris Johnson vowed to impose further sanctions on Russia, causing “maximum economic cost” following a military strike on a maternity hospital in Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol.
