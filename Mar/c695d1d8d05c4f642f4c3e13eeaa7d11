The poor animals’ enclosure was repeatedly targeted by the Russian army before they were rescued by a volunteer. In the video, some ten kangaroos appear patiently waiting in a van as they are transported, while the volunteer drives the car. Among the animals are seen what look like two small Albino Wallabies, an extremely rare kind of species of the macropod family. One of the adorable creatures is seen to be curiously looking out of the van window, as they cross the destroyed from the shelling area of Kharkiv. The animals lived in the Feldman Ecopark, located in the outskirts of Kharkiv, at the north of the city. Russian forces have conducted numerous attacks in the city of Kharkiv since the invasion of Ukraine, more than a month ago. Thankfully, the volunteer managed to remove the kangaroos from the shelled zoo and transport them to safety on Thursday, March 24. They are now kept in a place where they are thought to be safe and protected. Animals are being evacuated during the past few weeks from the Ecopark with the help of volunteers and NGOs. Before the war, the Ecopark was home to over 2,000 animals, including llamas, alpacas, tigers, chimpanzees, snakes, and more. The organisation is making an urgent appeal for donations that will help save the remaining animals trapped in the war. In a message to its followers on social media, the Felsman Ecopark said: “Rescue of animals from the territory of the Ecopark continues! “These kangaroos were taken out the day before yesterday, that is, now they are already safe.
