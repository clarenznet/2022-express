The sixth season of Married at First Sight UK gave fans plenty of drama to feast on back in 2021 and with a new series on the way, fans can indulge in seasons one to six on All4. Morag Crichton, 31, who had been partnered up with Luke Dawson, 36, has since opened up about her challenging time on the programme during Wednesday’s episode of Steph’s Packed Lunch. While the reality star prepared a prawn linguine in the Channel 4 kitchen for hosts Steph McGovern and Gareth Thomas, Morag revealed the initial wedding vows aren’t real. Speaking about her ceremony, she explained: “You dress up and you say, ‘I do’. "And you’re supposed to treat it as though you are 100 per cent married and committed to each other. “But then, it’s very testing, very testing,” the Essex star added.

The former BBC Breakfast host exclaimed: “Yeah! It’s really good fun.”      Steph then asked the reality star: “Have you stayed in touch with Luke though?” “I mean, do you stay in touch with your exes?” Morag hit back before Steph replied: “No.” The Married At First Sight star giggled: “There you go.” As the studio began to fill with laughter, Gareth playfully swiped at Steph: “Back at you!”     After weeks of getting to know each other, Morag shared her doubts over Luke with her mum and close pals, who didn’t hold back over their concerns he wasn’t her usual type when meeting Luke for the first time. Hoping to bring their relationship forward, Luke was often seen sharing his concerns with the other lads on the reality show, who felt Morag wasn't being reasonable about her doubts. The pair had to decide whether to stick with their marriage or to split at the final altar and in a shocking twist, the couple chose to continue their relationship as newlyweds. Since the programme, the lovebirds announced they have since separated. Married At First Sight UK seasons 1-6 are available to stream on All 4
