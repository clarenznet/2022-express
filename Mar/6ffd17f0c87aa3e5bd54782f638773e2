The German, 54, is accused of hiding, or failing to hand over assets before and after he was declared bankrupt in June 2017. It came after he borrowed around £3.5million from private bank Arbuthnot Latham for a property in Mallorca. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley told Southwark Crown Court in London that the assets include trophies for the 1985 and 1989 Wimbledon men’s singles titles and his 1992 Olympic gold medal. Becker is accused of concealing £950,000 from the sale of a car dealership, failure to declare two German properties, his interest in a flat in Chelsea, and hiding a £700,000 bank loan. Judge Deborah Taylor told the jury: “You must ignore this defendant’s celebrity.” Becker denies all 24 charges under the Insolvency Act. The trial continues.
