Since the conflict began in February, Russian advancement has displaced approximately two million Ukrainians. Neighbouring countries have shouldered much of the caring responsibility, with Poland taking on approximately 1.3 million people. But the UK is among nations that have accepted the least, having taken on only a few hundred more than Belarus, which has joined Vladimir Putin in hammering their home. The Home Office has approved roughly 1,000 applications from Ukrainians hoping to relocate to the UK via its family reunion route. Britons have called on the department to do more, with many urging officials to waive entry requirements as they have in other nations. Should the Government follow these demands, the question remains as to whether UK residents would follow in the footsteps of their neighbours on the continent and house them.
