Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has explained why Mohamed Salah was only fit enough to be named among the substitutes for their clash against Arsenal on Wednesday night. Salah has been Liverpool's main source of goals once again this campaign with an incredible 28 strikes in all competitions so far.  He found the back of the net once again at the weekend against Brighton after scoring from the spot. But there was genuine concern just moments after his goal when Salah appeared in serious pain with a foot injury. The Egypt international was subbed off and immediately headed down the tunnel for treatment. He was nowhere to be seen at training on Monday, sparking doubt in his potential involvement against Arsenal. But Salah was present at team training on Tuesday, suggesting he had shaken off the foot problem. However, Klopp choce not to start Salah against Arsenal, going with a front three of Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota.

"He made it, it was just yesterday we only had this one training session," Klopp said. "For Mo it was a session to test if everything was fine. It was fine. "So no, he doesn't start but we have him in the backhand and he can come on."  For Liverpool, a win against Arsenal will see them move to just one point behind league leaders Manchester City. All eyes will then be on the title-deciding fixture at the Etihad on April 10, and Klopp is more than up for the challenge. "That's the plan [to push City]," said Klopp. "The plan is to be as annoying as possible. We have to win our games. "It's final after final after final that we play. We're not ten points ahead with 10 to go. It's in front of us - attack it, chase it, go for it. It's the only chance we have."
