To cast the focus large and wide over sport and the crucial role played by women on a daily basis, the #SheCan movement is soon to be launched. Express Sport is proud to announce the first offering will drop on Wednesday, March 9, with BT Sport presenter Jules Breach in the hotseat. Breach's journey in sports journalism started back on local radio in Brighton with a supportive boss who was “keen to have a female voice” on their sports show and gave her the chance to step in as cover. The presence of women in the world of sports reporting is a growing area, and Breach is happy to see that solidarity and support networks are emerging all the time. “It’s really lovely to have that support from the other girls,” she says. “We’re constantly looking out for each other and making sure if someone has been affected by something at a match, on social media or something we’re all there for each other.” It is however a sad reality of the role that Breach knows she will sometimes be judged differently to her male counterparts, and receive and unwanted type of attention as a result.  But instead of seeing that as an added pressure, she recognises the opportunity it provides for her and others to be role models to young girls with the same dream she once had many years ago. "I wouldn’t say I feel pressure, because I never really took on this job imagining that anyone would ever look up to me. “I think more than anything, it’s just important to show young girls that are interested in sport and interested in working in it that they can be respected," Breach says. "It is a place where they can be welcomed, they can be comfortable and they can be successful as well. I think that’s really important."  Make sure to tune in for the show which begins at 1pm over on the Daily Express Sport Facebook page, which can be found by clicking here.
