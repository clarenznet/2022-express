The charity said: “In an ever-changing world, nature will always be a source of comfort for many of us. This spring, explore some of the best places to spot blossom. “We care for hundreds of trees that blossom in the spring, many of which are historical varieties. This includes the tree said to inspire Newton's theory of gravity and the orchard that Thomas Hardy loved to play in as a child.”
