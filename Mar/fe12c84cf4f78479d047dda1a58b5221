The Russian strike in Ukraine's Ivano-Frankivsk region on Friday is believed to have been carried out using Kinzhal missiles, which have previously been claimed to have a range of around 2,000 km. PUTIN'S army has used hypersonic weapons, for the first time ever, to destroy a Ukrainian underground depot, Russia's defence military claims.  Hypersonic weapons' speed makes them harder to track by defence systems. Russia has never before admitted to using hypersonic missiles in combat. Major General Igor Yevgenyevich Konashenkov claimed the targeted warehouse had been housing missiles and "aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops". According to the Interfax news agency, the ministry said it had also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port city of Odesa using a coastal missile system.
