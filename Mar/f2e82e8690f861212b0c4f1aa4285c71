She was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after being hit in her upper body while waiting at a bus stop in Toxteth, Liverpool, at 5.10pm on Tuesday. The girl is recovering in a serious but stable condition. Two people have been arrested. Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Kameen described the attack as "callous and cowardly" yesterday. He added: "It is an absolute miracle - and credit to the NHS - that this young woman has survived." Det Ch Sup Kameen said police are looking for a number of people riding up to four bikes, possibly electric ones. The suspects were all wearing dark clothing and face masks or balaclavas.  Shots were fired by "one or more" people on the bikes before they fled, police believe. Det Ch Sup Kameen added: "When the ambulance crew arrived ...they found a young girl who had suffered a gunshot wound to her upper body and some devastating injuries." Shortly after the shooting a 21-year-old man arrived at hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm, which police say could be linked. Despite his 29 years of service, Det Ch Sup Kameen said that he still found the shooting "utterly appalling and shocking". A 21-year-old man was arrested later on Tuesday on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.A 60-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.
