Max Verstappen is set to join Lewis Hamilton as F1's joint-highest earner by putting pen to paper on a new multi-year contract with Red Bull Racing this week. Express Sport explores the 10 highest-earning drivers on the grid ahead of the 2022 season's curtain-raiser in Bahrain on March 20. Verstappen has agreed a new deal with the Milton Keynes-based team worth just over £40million a year, the same salary as Hamilton currently earns on his two-year Mercedes contract. An official announcement is expected by the end of the week as the 24-year-old commits his long-term future. The agreement will provide Red Bull and Verstappen with a mighty boost before they pursue a first Constructors' Championship since 2013 this year. And it's a special campaign in itself for the Dutchman, who enters with a number one on his new car, symbolising his status as a first-time-ever world champion after pipping Hamilton to the post in December.

Whilst Verstappen's new deal will almost take him up to his 30s, Hamilton's £40m-per-year package expires at the end of the 2023 season. Lando Norris is the third-highest earner on the grid, recently also penning a new four-year contract with McLaren worth £42m (£10.5m a year). Ferrari star Charles Leclerc and Norris' McLaren teammate Daniel Ricciardo are level in terms of earnings, currently pocketing £10.19m annually.

Back-to-back world champion in 2005 and 2006, Fernando Alonso, is the eighth-highest earner, garnering £6.55m a year at Alpine. And, somewhat surprisingly, Verstappen's Red Bull teammate, who helped him win his maiden crown, earns the ninth-highest annual salary at £4.5m. Alonso's Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon rounds off the top 10 with a contract worth £4m a year. =1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) - £40m =1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - £40m 3.
