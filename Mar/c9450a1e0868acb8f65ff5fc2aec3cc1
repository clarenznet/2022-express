GSL Installations says Elsina Khayrova owes it Â£241,000 for fountains and garden lights at her "extremely large house" in Virginia Water, Surrey. Ms Khayrova said, to be the daughter of a Russian politician, disputed GSL's claim at a High Court trial. Alastair Panton, for the London firm, said she paid for earlier GSL work rather than her diamond-dealer husband Dmitry Tsvetkov. Mr Panton said her reason was that "her husband is on the Kremlin's most-wanted list. Apparently, his life is in danger." Ms Khayrova, who is divorcing, was not at the trial and was said to be ill. The judge will deliver a ruling soon.
