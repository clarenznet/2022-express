The Scottish First Minister has come under renewed pressure following comments from her party’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford. He said: “Russia is financing the war in Ukraine from the receipts of fossil fuel sales. If we turn off demand from the west, we bring the maximum pressure to be felt by Putin and his regime.” Ms Sturgeon has always been emphatically against drilling in the Cambo oilfield, off the Shetland Islands, but in light of Russian belligerence and widespread sanctions from the west, the First Minister could be forced to renew her policy stance. It has been argued keeping sources of gas and oil within the UK’s domestic remit could reduce fossil fuels as well as reliance on international sources such as Russia. In 2020, some 48 percent of UK gas was brought in from the North Sea, yet this figure is declining, with Britain now importing gas from Norway, Russia, Qatar and the USA. So, do you think the First Minister should renew her stance on drilling for gas and oil within the UK? Should Russian imports of fuel end completely?
