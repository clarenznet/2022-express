Upon hearing the news of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Queen legend Brian May posted on social media: “To all our dear friends in Ukraine, we are shocked, horrified, saddened that your beautiful country has been invaded and your very lives threatened. We send out love and our prayers. And someday we will rock together again. Bri.” The guitarist and drummer Roger Taylor have performed as Queen with both Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert in the past and now they’re making their 2008 Kharkiv live show available to stream on YouTube today for Ukraine Relief. Both Brian and Roger posted on their Instagram that the recording of Queen and Paul Rodgers Live in Ukraine will be available to watch in the UK on the band’s official YouTube channel at 5pm GMT today. The rock duo shared: “Queen + Paul Rodgers: Live In Ukraine 2008. YouTube Special. Raising funds for Ukraine Relief. In September 2008 Queen + Paul Rodgers answered a call from Ukraine’s Elena Pinchuk’s ANTIAIDS Foundation to reach out to the youth of the country with the message Don’t Let AIDS Ruin Your Life by playing a free Life Must Go On AIDS awareness concert in Kharkiv’s historic Freedom Square to a live audience of more than 350,000 – and a television audience of more than 10 million.” Queen added: “The band recall that event as ‘an unforgettable experience… one of those rare things in life you know you will never forget. A meeting in music, but also a coming together to fight a common enemy…’ Today, with millions of Ukrainian refugees in need of urgent humanitarian relief from a different affliction, Queen is returning to its historic moment with a YouTube special screening aimed at drawing donations for UNHCR’s relief efforts. Queen + Paul Rodgers Live In Ukraine plays on YouTube Saturday, March 19 at 10AM PDT / 1PM EDT / 5PM GMT.
