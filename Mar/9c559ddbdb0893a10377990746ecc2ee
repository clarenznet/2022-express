Care home residents, people aged 75-plus, and those who are immunosuppressed and aged 12 and over are among those eligible for the latest jab.People will be contacted when it is their turn to be vaccinated. They can then secure an appointment through the national booking system, either online or by calling NHS 119. Around 600,000 people are due to be invited to book this week. Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS, said: “The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme has not stopped in its efforts to protect people from coronavirus – around five million of the most vulnerable people will be eligible for a spring dose and, from tomorrow, we will start giving eligible groups their additional top up in protection. We have protected millions of people at speed thanks to the efforts of our staff, aided by volunteers. “They will once again rise to the next challenge.” Ms Pritchard stressed there is “no need to contact the NHS” because “we will be in touch so you can book your appointment at one of hundreds of vaccination sites across the country”. Research suggests that since mid-December around 157,000 hospitalisations have been prevented by booster doses. Vaccines minister Maggie Throup urged people not to delay getting jabbed, saying: “The British public has responded incredibly during the pandemic, with tens of millions of people rolling up their sleeves to do their part by getting vaccinated. We must ensure those at greatest risk of serious illness from Covid are protected and spring boosters will top up people’s immunity. “The NHS will contact you when it’s your turn – please take up the offer as soon as you can.” Since December 2020, when Maggie Keenan received the first Covid-19 jab outside of a clinical trial, NHS staff and volunteers have delivered more than 118 million vaccinations in total – including 32 million top-up jabs since the booster rollout began in September.
