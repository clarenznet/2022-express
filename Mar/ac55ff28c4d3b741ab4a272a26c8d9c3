Major-General Oleg Mityaev, 47, commander of the army's crack 150th motorised rifle division, died in the storming of Mariupol, say the Ukrainians. A picture of the decorated father of two's corpse was released by Kyiv's Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko. He is the fourth Russian general to die in the war. Moscow has only confirmed the death of one general, and has not commented on reports about Mityaev. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the death of another Russian general last night but did not name him. A mourning picture was released in Russia showing the photographs of six elite "maroon beret" special forces fighters from theVityaz Special Purpose Centre of the Dzerzhinsky Division, named after Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. It was later revealed that a seventh had been slain. Only four have been named.  It came after a top Russian airman said his country's forces have suffered losses on a scale that will "horrify" people when the figure, a closely guarded secret, is finally revealed. Captain Alexander Garnaev - a famous test pilot who won the Kremlin's highest honour - denounced the "completely incomprehensible" war. He added: "It is unbearable for me to see how much our men - including those I know personally - suffer. Sooner or later society will know the final number of losses. Society will be horrified."
