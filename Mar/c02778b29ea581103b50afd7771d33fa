The “down to earth” couple, as they describe themselves in their job advertisement, are looking for a “kind and caring dog nanny and housekeeper”. The couple is offering £16 - £22 gross per hour depending on the experience of the potential sitter for their 1.5-year-old French bulldog. The dog-related duties of the role include taking her out for walks and keeping her company during the day. The successful candidate would also have to ensure the French bulldog is fed and that her water bowl is always filled up. The owners expect the “dog nanny” to also clean their two-bedroom, two-bathroom house. As part of the everyday duties, they ask for the nanny to do their laundry, iron their clothes, change their beds, clean their bathrooms and kitchen, vacuum and dust the house. Moreover, the nanny would be responsible to run errands in the local area, as well as deep-clean the couple’s house every other week.
