The actress went braless in a gold cut out gown, with the stars ample assets barely covered by a black adhesive bra styled top. The stars shoulders and arms were covered with a black floral lace, not to take attention away from her gold trailed dress. The dress featured a black sparkle hem line with the waist of the gown full of embellished gems, drawing in the actress's petite waist. She swept her blonde tresses in a neat bun, not taking attention away from her enviable dress. Lady Gaga went for a minimal makeup look with a gold eyeshadow and a subtle pink lip.
