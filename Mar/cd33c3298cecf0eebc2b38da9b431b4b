26-year-old social media celebrity Demi Rose has more than 18 million fans on Instagram waiting to catch a glimpse of her latest looks. However, this time, she seemed to have surpassed herself as she shared photos from a beach-side holiday, receiving more than 220,000 likes in just a few hours. The cover photo displayed Demi in a black dress with a plunging bra-line and a cut-out waist. However, another risqu√© picture in her upload revealed that the back part of the star's mesh dress was totally sheer, giving fans a cheeky glimpse at her equally famous derriere. Male admirers might be disappointed to learn that she is not on a girls-only trip, but on a romantic holiday with a mystery man. Although he did make an appearance this week on her Instagram Stories, she has opted not to name or tag him, instead leaving fans guessing. She showcased another holiday outfit earlier in a black top with a cut-out section over her bust, paired with a black Balenciaga baseball cap - and there will surely be more snaps to come as the holiday action kicks off.
