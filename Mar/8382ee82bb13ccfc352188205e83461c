This is backed up by the reviews, with one person saying they were able to “see a difference in my skin after a week”. The unique formula uses a combination of collagen peptides and vitamin B3 in order to provide results this quickly, as they intensely hydrate the skin for 24 hours, helping to smooth the texture of the skin and restore the skin's protective barrier. You may not even know your skin barrier needs protecting, but if you’re suffering from dryness or stubborn sensitivity, there’s a fair chance your skin could benefit from this powerful serum. Buy: Amazon (£15) As the skin is so deeply hydrating and restorative, many reviewers say it has helped them with wrinkles and uneven skin texture, with one going so far as to say: “I love this serum and maybe, just maybe, using it helps me to lie about my age!”. The serum from the Olay Regenerist range penetrates up to ten layers deep into the skin surface, meaning your skin is getting a deep boost of hydration - and it’s not just the outer layers seeing the benefits. One happy customer said before the serum their skin was looking “weathered and dull”, but with a few applications of the serum “it has been given a lift”.
