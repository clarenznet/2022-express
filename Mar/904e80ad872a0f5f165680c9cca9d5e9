The defence secretary said Britain would remember the lost lives of “young Argentinians who were sent to needlessly in order to save a dictator’s political position” and claimed that today the “deaths of so many young Russian soldiers are the responsibility of the Kremlin”. He described how Margaret Thatcher inspired Britain’s forces with a similar fighting spirit seen today in those resisting the Russian invasion. “Margaret Thatcher stood out for her leadership and determination to stand up for the values and freedoms we all hold so dear,” he said. “By her leadership she equipped the forces with the most important weapon of all – the moral component, that deep sense that what we were fighting for was legal, justified and right. “And today that same moral component is what is arming the men and women of Ukraine.” The defence secretary warned Britain faced a “direct threat to our freedoms and values” but he said he was “proud of what the UK has done to add to that moral fight,” boasting: “Through Boris Johnson’s leadership on sanctions and military aid Britain has led the way.” Drawing a direct comparison with the war for the Falklands, he said: “Just like in 1982, Putin’s arrogant assumptions have directly led to the level of casualties and attrition amongst the Russian army. The Kremlin assumed that Ukraine would not fight – he was wrong. “The Kremlin assumed that his Army was invincible – they were wrong and they assumed that the international community would splinter – and they’ve been proven wrong. “We have never been more united on sanctions, on military aid and in Nato.” He recalled how Margaret Thatcher told those gathered at a party conference in the year of the Falklands conflict that “peace, freedom and justice are only to be found where people are prepared to defend them,” adding: “That remains the case today.”
