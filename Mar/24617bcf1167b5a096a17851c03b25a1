Broker L&C averaged the lowest remortgage rates on offer from major lenders to calculate its findings for a £150,000 loan over 25 years. It found that, back in October 2021 when rates were at a low point, a borrower would have been paying just over £557 per month for a two-year fixed-rate deal. If they were remortgaging now, they could face paying £627 - £70 a month more - adding up to around £840 per year. What is happening where you live?

"Borrowers can lock in at a current rate up to six months ahead, giving the chance to ensure a smooth switchover when their current deal ends."
