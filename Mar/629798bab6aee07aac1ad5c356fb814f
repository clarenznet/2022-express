After sharing some updates on her beloved cats to Twitter, she bonded with one fan over the “heartbreak” of losing a pet.     Naga, 46, took to social media on Tuesday to share some rare insights into her personal life, posting some snaps of the adorable cats she shares with husband James. In view of her 267,100 Twitter followers, she revealed that one of her adorable pets had recently been handed in by a member of the public. Sharing a pic of her calico Missy about to chomp down on some cat food, she wrote: “Tonight's mini adventure…” “Missy gets let out for half an hour (she refuses to use the cat flap and this is a regular evening occurrence).” READ MORE: Craig Revel Horwood speaks on 'falling in love' with Strictly co-star       “I take a shower and get organised. “Next thing a phone call telling me that the cat has been handed in by a member of the public to the vet. “I collect wayward cat,” she continued. “Vet (who I've known for years) says member of public believes Missy is hungry as she's so thin.     “Vet explained that said cat is very old but very well loved. “Member of public not convinced,” she wrote incredulously. “Upshot: Missy is no longer allowed out to roam for her safety. “Cats!” The BBC Radio 5 Live star exclaimed.
