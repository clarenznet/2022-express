   Addressing her 17.7 million Instagram fans Madonna wrote: “Dirty Weekend…” Her first photo featured the singer in a pink snapback to match her lipstick, with a pair of dark sunglasses covering her eyes. She wore a silver choker and a crucifix necklace beneath her black leather bodysuit, which she wore over a pair of fishnets. The star wore a mismatched black glove and bangles on her left arm, and a black leather sleeve with no fabric covering her hand on the right.  In another snap, the singer posed suggestively against the wall in what appeared to be a stripped back version of the outfit. With her mouth wide open, Madonna squatted and showed off her high-heeled wedge boots. The singer then included another snap of herself in the mirror, which showed off her long legs beneath a barely-there leather skirt. Madonna's final snap took things one step further, as she posed for the camera in a skimpy black thong, which she paired with a leather corset. The star recently released a remix of her song Frozen, which has since gone viral on TikTok.
