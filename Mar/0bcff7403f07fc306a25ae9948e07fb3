Screenings are being staged at the Barbican Cinema in London, along with a full digital edition that’s available across the UK and Ireland and also comes with pre-recorded in-depth talks with filmmakers, film participants, activists, and Human Rights Watch advocates.  Issues around freedom of choice, cultural expression, and family trauma, showing individuals and communities standing in solidarity to create change and amplify marginalised voices, are a key focus this year. Despite the global pandemic, the works show communities coming together and making a difference —from journalists in Myanmar, Latinx community members in Texas, and young girls in Bangladesh, to judges in Poland and asylum seekers in the UK. Support from the People’s Postcode Lottery has helped make the festival possible and five films in the programme particularly highlight freedom of expression and threats to democracy. Audiences can watch Journalists in Myanmar (Myanmar Diaries, Official Competition Berlinale 2022), asylum seekers in the UK (Silence Heard Loud), three teenage girls chasing their dreams and waves in Bangladesh (Bangla Surf Girls, Closing Night) and cultural and inter-generational trauma (Dina Amer’s You Resemble Me). “We are living through unprecedented times, and the films in this year’s line-up speak directly to many issues we currently face,” said John Biaggi, the festival’s director. “We are very proud of this year’s film and discussion programme, which highlights the ability to create change through courageous individuals on both sides of the lens, and to experience what happens when, little by little, solidarity turns into a resounding voice that the powers that be can’t ignore. "We look forward to welcoming audiences back into the Barbican’s beautiful Cinema 1 and to inviting mainland UK and Irish audiences to our digital screenings and conversations.” Tickets: https://ff.hrw.org/london https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/series/human-rights-watch-film-festival-2022, and keep in touch #HRWFFLDN @hrwfilmfestival
