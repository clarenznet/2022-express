Since November the Government has forced farmers to house their birds so as to protect animal health. Producers have been allowed to keep free-range status for 16 weeks, a grace period which expired yesterday. Eggs sold in the UK will now be described as "barn eggs" until the mandatory measures are lifted. Labels on boxes will change and supermarkets will have to explain to consumers what is happening. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said: "We are experiencing our largest ever outbreak of avian flu and housing measures remain in force to protect poultry and other birds from this highly infectious and unpleasant disease.  "We continue to provide support for the poultry sector throughout this challenging time." Defra added that with the end of the grace period it has "worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible".
