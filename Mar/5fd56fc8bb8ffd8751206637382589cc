Paris Saint-Germain have offered Kylian Mbappe a new blockbuster contract to ward off transfer interest from Real Madrid. The new deal would see the Frenchman earn double Cristiano Ronaldo’s wages at Manchester United. PSG have made an astronomical offer to Mbappe in a bid to keep hold of him as his contract expires at the end of the season. The eye-watering total of wages on the table would see the France international earn twice as much as Ronaldo at United. Real Madrid are desperate to snap up the striker in the summer when his deal comes to an end. Their interest is long-term, having made offers up to £180million last summer only for PSG to turn them down. The French giants have always been confident that their prized asset would not leave, despite the fact that he had turned down all advances. But their latest offer could turn the World Cup winner’s head after they put some extraordinary money in front of him. According to L’Equipe, PSG have presented Mbappe with a two-year deal that is worth €50m (£42m) a year. And that also includes a jaw-dropping €100m (£84m) signing-on bonus, which would make the striker the best-paid player in the world. For context, United currently pay the most in wages for one player in the Premier League, forking out £500,000 per-week for Ronaldo. If Mbappe was to accept PSG’s new offer, that would see him earn double what the five-time Ballon d’Or is getting at Old Trafford. While the contract would be a huge amount of money for PSG, it would not even totally clear up his future. The deal would last only until 2024, when the issue of Mbappe’s future will come up again with Real Madrid already in contention. The 23-year-old has made no secret of his desire to play at the Bernabeu and counts the likes of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane as his idols. And Los Blancos will not want to see their top target this summer pen his future to PSG but it remains to be seen whether a counter-offer will come from the Spanish capital.
