Britain is accepting migrants from Ukraine who are fleeing the conflict brought upon them by Russia. Schemes are in place to help those arriving in the UK find homes and get settled. But when it comes to finding work, what should you do? As of March 29, more than four million refugees have left Ukraine - most fleeing to nearby countries. For those wanting to head to the UK, there are several schemes in place to help start visa applications and find homes. Leaving everything behind to move can be stressful, and if you have left your job behind the prospect of starting over may seem daunting. However, there are ways Ukrainians arriving in the UK can find work. Read More: Is there a minimum wage for Ukrainians working in the UK? Charity RemoteUkraine.org helps to pair Ukrainians with remote working opportunities.

You can register here to become a candidate and have your profile available to those looking for workers. Jobs are available across a range of sectors including software, industry, marketing, trade and more. Another platform helping Ukrainians find jobs in the UK is Notion. Notion has a range of roles available on its website, as well as advice on a range of topics, from employment rights to CV support. Notion has collaborated with both Ukrainian Institute London and United For Ukraine volunteers to create a list of opportunities, regularly updating job listings. For any companies with available jobs, you can email info@ukrainianinstitute.org.uk with details. For Ukrainian refugees unable to work or not able to find the right job opportunity right away, the UK Government has made benefits immediately accessible. These include Universal Credit, as well as job finding support via the JobCentre. For more information, Express.co.uk has compiled a guide to benefits in the UK for Ukrainians.
