A meeting of the Oireachtas committee took place on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing negotiations on the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, which are still at an impasse. Northern Ireland traders are concerned about the lack of progress and irresolution. Margaret Hearty, the CEO of InterTradeIreland, said there has still been "continued uncertainties" over final agreements on the Protocol, thus causing a "dampening effect on investment" in the country. She also said Northern Ireland has been left in the dark by the bloc since it was removed from the EU’s single market for services — which is also having a "particular impact on firms with an all-island outlook or aspirations." Ireland has also suffered due to the EU's ambiguous approach to the Protocol. The Irish Independent reported that freight volumes between the UK and Dublin port were down 50 percent on this time last year. Italian MEP Annalisa Tardino thinks Brexit has set a "dangerous precedent" in the EU for the gains the UK has made. She told Express.co.uk: "Brexit was not a disaster for the United Kingdom, but rather a success." These comments came as data from Bloomberg showed that Britain's post-Brexit economy grew at the fastest pace since World War II. Britain had the highest economic growth since 1941, in 2021 at 7.5 percent. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
