Moving to a new home can be difficult, especially when that move has been forced due to war or invasion. Moving can be especially difficult for children, who may have left behind friends and family. It's important to make sure children get the best education possible, including those fleeing Ukraine and arriving in Britain. As well as registering your child for a new school place, there are some community schools across the UK that offer weekend classes.
