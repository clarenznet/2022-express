Alexander Zverev has opened up on his disqualification from the Mexico Open after being found guilty of a ‘major offence’. The world No 3 was withdrawn from the tournament when he smashed the umpire’s chair with his racket after losing a doubles match. He has now been handed a suspended eight-week ban and a £19,000 ($25,000) fine after an ATP investigation. Zverev was the defending champion in Acapulco but was withdrawn from the singles draw when he smashed the umpire’s chair with his racket at the conclusion of a doubles match he lost alongside partner Marcelo Melo. It had gone into a decisive first-to-ten-point tiebreak when the German thought there had been an unfair call at 8-6, as he ranted: “Look where the ball bounced. It’s 8-6 in the tie-break, look where the ball bounced. For f*** sake, it’s your line. It’s f****** your line. You f****** idiot.” After losing it 10-6 to Lloyd Glasspool and Harri Heliovaara, Zverev continued his sweary tirade as he hit umpire Alessandro Germani’s chair with his racket, while the official could be seen flinching with each strike. Shortly after the outburst, Zverev was withdrawn from the tournament, fined £30,000 ($40,000) and forced to give up his £24,000 ($31,570) prize money and his ranking points earned in the event as well as pay his hotel costs. JUST IN: Raducanu hints at Murray partnership dream ahead of Indian Wells  The ATP confirmed they were investigating the incident and earlier this week confirmed the world No 3 had been found guilty of a ‘major offence’. He was given a hefty fine and narrowly avoided a ban, with the men’s tour ruling that an eight-week suspension would only be imposed on Zverev if he incurs a further code violation in the next year that results in a fine for verbal or physical abuse on-court or on-site, or unsportsmanlike conduct of a disrespectful or aggressive act. The Olympic champion played his first event at Germany’s Davis Cup tie against Brazil last week but is now competing in his first ATP-sanctioned tournament since the Mexico Open withdrawal in Indian Wells, and has opened up on what he called the “worst moment of his life.” "It still is embarrassing for me now. Walking around the locker room, it's not a nice feeling,” Zverev admitted ahead of his BNP Paribas Open campaign.

I'm also a human being, and I can guarantee you I will never act this way again in my life. It was definitely the worst moment of my life." After promising he would not act in the same way again, the 24-year-old opened up on the changes he’d made in the wake of the incident, saying: “I've been doing work, meditation-wise.” Although he condemned his behaviour, Zverev defended his character and attempted to explain his actions. "I think there are stress situations in everyone's life where stuff like this happens. I'm not the first, I won't be the last for something bad to happen on the court,” he said. "I know who I am as a person and this doesn't reflect on me. I have played until 5am the day before - the same day I went back to play doubles. "I am somebody that gives it his all on the court. I think a lot of top singles players would have maybe come out to the doubles court and if they would have lost the match, they would have been fine with it. I would have never physically harmed anyone." With the possibility of an eight-week ban kicking in for any similar code violations he receives up until February 22 2023, Zverev admitted he would deserve a suspension if he did the same again. He said: "If I do that again, they have every right to ban me - it's as simple as that. "If I do that again, it means I haven't learnt. I think everybody in life deserves a second chance but if you repeatedly do mistakes it means that you haven't learnt."
