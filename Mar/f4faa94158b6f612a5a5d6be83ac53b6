Mr Middleton, who is the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, set off rumours following after sharing a cryptic Instagram post. The rumours were ignited after the 34-year-old posted a sweet snap to mark mother's day.  He captured the image: “Happy Mother's Day to all the mother's (especially my mother), grandmother's, dog mum's and soon to be mother's out there.” The “soon to be” mothers comment had royal fans speculating he was referring to wife Alizée Thevenet. However, the post didn’t include any images of James or Alizée but rather an image of the couple’s four dogs. Royal fans immediately took to the comments, asking Mr Middleton to confirm the news.  One Instagram user wrote: “Ahhhhhh is someone having a baby?” Another said: “Soon to be meaning Alizée?” While a third added: “That's how I interpreted that's too…” “Is Alize pregnant?” asked another.
