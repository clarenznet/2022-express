Here, Reynolds is a cynical, quippy fighter pilot from the year 2050 who flies through a wormhole to 2022 to team up with his quippy and cynical 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell). If you've seen Back To The Future, you'll know the dangers of "parallel contact" but old Adam thinks it's worth the risk. The year 2050 is even more miserable, he says, than the future world of The Terminator. With the help of their action heroine wife (Zoe Saldana), the two Adams must stop their boffin dad (Mark Ruffalo) from inventing time travel and inadvertently ushering in the fascistic rule of his old business partner (Catherine Keener). There are some amusing references to 80s movies, a diverting car chase and lots of bloodless CGI shootouts with silver stormtroopers. I just wish someone would offer Reynolds a way out of his own time loop. He's been playing slight variations on this character since Deadpool hit the big screen in 2016.
