AJ Odudu took to Instagram to share some snaps of her getaway to the Caribbean island of Antigua. The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant stunned in the natural photos as she put her bikini body on full display. The 34-year-old showcased her incredible physique in the leopard print two-piece that showed off her toned legs and sculpted abs. AJ appeared to go make-up free as she confidently posed for the pictures. Stood on a beach, the amateur dancer was all smiles as she flaunted her toned figure. She kept her dark locks in a short-styled bob as the television presenter soaked up the sun on her luxury getaway. In a second photo, AJ protected her eyes from the glare of the sun behind a pair of sunglasses. The Strictly star explained she was taking a break to "recharge" and relax after a busy few months. In view of her 228,000 followers, AJ captioned the post: "No rest for the wicked, so I'm resting! See ya when I've recharged me batteries." She was quickly inundated with messages, as celebrity pals took to the comment section. Stacey Dooley commented: "The f***** abs every time!" Fleur East remarked: "Enjoyyyyy that rest!!!" Strictly dancer Nancy Xuxi added a series of heart and fire emojis.
