Imelda Staunton wrapped up the role of playing the Queen, in fur coat and black hat, inset, to echo photos from the time but the double act did not extend to her footwear, where she opted for posh Hunter short wellies in between takes, rather than the formal black shoes worn by the monarch. The Queen and Prince Phillip made their four-day trip to Moscow in October 1994 - a tour the now 95-year-old is unlikely to repeat, given Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Rather than filming the drama in eastern Europe, Netflix producers of The Crown headed off to West Yorkshire, where they transformed the Little Germany district of Bradford into a doppelg√§nger for Moscow in the 1990s. Imelda, 66 - who has succeeded Olivia Colman, 48, in the role of the Queen - and Jonathan Pryce, 74, playing the Duke of Edinburgh, recreated the historic state visit. The scenes, featuring replica Russian police cars and motorbikes, will form part of the hit show's eagerly anticipated fifth series which is due to be shown in November. Filming has taken place across the UK, with part of London doubling for the village of Lech, Austria with actress Elizabeth Debicki, 31, playing the Princess of Wales on a ski trip. While 16th century Burghley House in Stamford, Lincs took place of royal residence Windsor Castle - including for its devastating blaze in November 1992. The real Russian trip was lauded at the time as a massive change from the vast country's totalitarian past. The Queen viewed Kremlin treasures, attended the ballet Giselle at the Bolshoi Theatre with President Boris Yeltsin and his wife Naina, strolled across Red Square. Her Majesty was driven around in her Rolls-Royce, shipped over from London especially for the occasion.
