Shingles is a viral infection that creates a rash. According to data from the Government: “Around one in five people have had chickenpox develop shingles. Shingles itself is not contagious and can't spread from one person to another. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. The CDC stated: "Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. "The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in seven to 10 days." When the blisters burst and fluid leaks out, anybody in direct contact are at risk of catching the virus. The virus, however, can only infect those who have never had chickenpox before and/or have not had the chickenpox vaccine. An infection will lead to chickenpox, not shingles, but then the infected individual will also be at risk of shingles later on in life. The CDC added: "People with shingles cannot spread the virus before their rash blisters appear or after the rash crusts." About seven to 10 days after the blisters appear on the skin, they will begin to dry up. The leaked fluid will form a crust over the rash and the sores will no longer be open. A person will no longer be contagious after the blisters have crusted over. Shingles can appear in any area of the body, from the most visible to the most private. As well as a tingling sensation in the skin, a headache will start to develop or a patient may start to feel generally unwell.
