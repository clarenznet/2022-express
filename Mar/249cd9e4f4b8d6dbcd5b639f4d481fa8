The RSPCA is desperate to find loving adopters for five-year-old crossbreed Charlie. The pooch recently marked his 400th day at the charity's Newport Animal Centre in Wales. Poor Charlie was too scared to leave the corner of his kennel for weeks after he arrived last year. Since then he has come on in leaps and bounds but he is still patiently waiting for new owners to take him home with them. And he has sadly become the centre's longest-staying resident. Newport Animal Centre manager Nikki Tutton said: “We know there is so much love out there for Charlie who is such a cheeky chappy who really has transformed since he first came to us all those months ago. “We have got to know him so well over the past year and a bit, and he is going to make such a wonderful companion. “If you can help us find his perfect match, please spread the word.”  READ MORE: Special appeal for end-of-life home for elderly rescue dog with cancer  Charlie can find new things scary so he is looking for a patient owner in a quiet home with no children. He would love a garden and could live with another dog if they are introduced and get on.

He has such a beautiful personality and loves a cwtch from his carers. “We do have some requirements for his new home, but we just know there is that loving family out there for him!” Charlie was one of 45 dogs removed from a property in Ceredigion in January 2021 after the owner agreed to work with the RSPCA when the situation got out of control.
