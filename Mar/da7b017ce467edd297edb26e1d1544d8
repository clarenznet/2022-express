The UK could send £6.3million daily, equivalent to £2.3billion this year, to Moscow for the supply. Some four percent of our gas comes from Russia, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found. Its head of analysis Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin said: “Although not at the same level of some other European countries, the UK has been spending billions on Russian gas." “This is another reason why the UK needs to break its dependency on gas by deploying electric heat pumps and shifting from gas power stations to renewables.” Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the NHS must stop using energy supplied by the Russian-owned firm Gazprom. He is in talks with NHS England over ending the contracts, reported to have been worth £16million in 2021. A source said: “He has requested a wider review of any Russian role in supply chains across the health service.” More than a dozen NHS trusts are thought to be supplied by Gazprom, as well as several local councils. The cost of crude yesterday soared to its highest level for 10 years while the average petrol price exceeded £1.52 per litre. The price of diesel rose to a new peak of 155.79p.
