William and Kate were met with protests as they arrived on the Caribbean island on the second leg of an eight-day tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Â Some called for Britain and the Queen to pay reparations for the historic involvement of successive monarchs in the slave trade, going back to Elizabeth I. Mark Golding, Jamaica's leader of the opposition, called for William and Kate to apologise in an interview with the country's newspaper, The Gleaner. He said: "I would hope that I get the opportunity during the events I will be attending to have that dialogue with them and to bring it to their attention in a courteous and respectful way that this is the view held by many Jamaicans. "And that I think it would be helpful both to the Royal Family and Jamaica for them to consider this as a means of starting to move forward to a new future." The tour has been used to stir up calls for the country to become a republic. William is expected to echo his father Prince Charles in condemning slavery as a stain on the world's history during the couple's stay. But he is likely to stop short of a full apology.
