The Princess Royal, 71, is known for quietly carrying out her royal duties without fuss or fanfare. And now her secret may have been revealed by her daughter Zara Tindall. According to royal expert Robert Hardman's Queen Of Our Times book, Anne always carries a kiwi fruit with her wherever she goes. Zara is quoted as saying: "She always has a kiwi fruit." Anne is not a big fan of lunch and often produces a kiwi from her bag instead, the Daily Mail reports. Kiwis are loaded with vitamins and are often described as a superfood. A kiwi contains more Vitamin C than an orange and are rich in fibre. Anne celebrated her milestone 70th birthday in 2020 but is showing no signs of slowing down. She is often named as the hardest-working member of the Royal Family when engagements are tallied up.
