Hilaria Baldwin has confirmed she is pregnant with her seventh baby with actor husband Alec Baldwin. She referred to “uncertain times” and recent “ups and downs”, months on from Alec fatally shooting his colleague Halyna Hutchins. In view of her 935k followers, Hilaria, 38, posted a video with her six other children - daughters María Lucía Victoria, 13 months, and Carmen Gabriela, 8, and sons Rafael Thomas, 6, Leonardo Ángel Charles, 5, Romeo Alejandro David, 3½, and Eduardo Pao Lucas, 18 months. She wrote: “After many ups and downs over the past few years, we have an exciting up and a huge surprise: another Baldwinito is coming this fall. “We were pretty sure our family was complete, and we’re beyond happy with this surprise. “I’m sharing with you the moment we told the kids—as you can see, they are super excited! Our new baby is a very bright spot in our lives. “A blessing and a gift during such uncertain times. “I’ve missed you during my break from social media…I’m back and looking forward to continuing with you this wild journey that we call “life.” “Our love to you and your loved ones,” she concluded the post, which was only accepting approved comments. Three weeks ago, Hilaria announced she was taking some time away from social media, though she didn't explain why.
