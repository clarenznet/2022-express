Crucially, its life-saving effects are in addition to the benefits of other treatments already proven to improve people's chances of surviving. The advantages of baricitnib - a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, which costs £250 for a 10-day course of tablets – were uncovered in the latest study by Oxford University's Recovery Trial. The trial, which has made Britain a world leader in the hunt for Covid treatments, has previously identified three lifesavers: the cheap steroid dexamethasone, another arthritis drug called tocilizumab and the antibody treatment Ronapreve. Its studies showed patients on some of those drugs, who are also given baricitnib, had less risk of dying from severe Covid. Experts concluded that the average risk reduction is around 20 percent. The trial's Professor Sir Martin Landray said: "This opens up the possibility of using combinations of antiinflammatory drugs to further drive down the risk." Health Secretary Sajid Javid thanked everyone involved in the study and said experts will consider the results before decisions are made on next steps. A further 45,656 Covid cases were confirmed yesterday. There were 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - down by almost a fifth on last week. But the UK Health Security Agency said there has been a surge in the winter vomiting bug norovirus.
