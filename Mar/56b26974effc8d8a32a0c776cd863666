Old Trafford chiefs are now beginning to finalise their final decision over their next manager after completing the interview process. It's understood United have spoken to three managers - including Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. The Ajax and Paris Saint-Germain coaches are now thought to be in a straight shootout for the job with Ralf Rangnick set to move upstairs into a consultancy role this summer.

Sky Sports are reporting that sources close to Ten Hag and Ajax suggest talks have already taken place over finances and a potential announcement - something which United deny.

Luis Enrique has also confirmed he will be in charge of Spain for the Qatar World Cup in December.
