A Cathay Pacific representative explained: "We are always running contingency routings for potential events or scenarios within the world of aviation. "We compare flight routes daily, and will plan and fly what is the most efficient routing on the day. "The transatlantic option relies on the facilitation of strong seasonal tailwinds at this time of the year in order for the flight time to be between 16 and 17 hours, thereby making it more favourable than the transpacific route.  "We are monitoring the tailwinds situation on a daily basis as it is already tapering off. "Our Airbus A350-1000 aircraft can comfortably accomplish this in 16 to 17 hours with similar fuel consumption to the transpacific flights." The airline explained they monitor tailwinds every day. However, the current situation is not favourable as jet streams are usually stronger in the winter months. Cathay is currently waiting for overflight permits to operate the service. This is a normal procedure for a new route, the airline explained. Cathay’s current service between New York and Hong Kong stops in Los Angeles, where passengers need to take a connecting flight. The flight continues towards the Pacific and into Asia without entering Russian airspace.
