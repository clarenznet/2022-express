Virgin Media has launched a new deal that's offering customers free Google Nest smart speakers when they sign up for certain broadband bundles. Right now there's the chance to grab a Google Nest hub or bigger Nest Hub Max with certain plans including the Big Bundle or Ultimate Volt bundle. As a quick reminder, the Google Nest Hub features a 7-inch touch screen, full-range speakers and access to the useful Google Assistant. This means you ask questions, set timers, check local weather and see the latest news by simply using your voice. If you fancy something even bigger and better then the Nest Hub Max offers 10-inch screen, Stereo Speakers and peace of mind thanks to the addition of a built-in Nest Cam. This allows you to use your smartphone when you're away from home to check in and make sure everything is safe and secure. The Google Nest Hub Max usually costs over £200 so this is a decent offer from Virgin. If you don't want a smart speaker then you can also opt to have up to £150 credit added you your bill instead. This means you'll get a few months of your contract for free. If any of that sounds enticing then Express.co.uk has rounded up some of the best deals from Virgin that include the Google speaker.
