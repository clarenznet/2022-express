According to GlobalCheck, the broadcaster's availability is 17 percent, which suggests some services have been blocked. While BBC services have been limited in Russia, Radio Liberty and Deutsche Welle websites have also been blocked.  Similarly, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, also appears to be blocked in the country. This comes after the BBC halted all content licensing with its Russian customers.   However, before Russian users reported experiencing issues with BBC services, the corporation confirmed it launched two new shortwave radio frequencies to assure its news was available in parts of Ukraine and Russia. While BBC services have reportedly been blocked, Russia’s most prominent independent television channel, TV Rain, also suspended operations on Thursday.   According to CNN, over the weekend, Russia’s Roskomnadzor, or Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, threatened TV Rain and other Russian news outlets over their coverage of Ukraine's invasion. The official communications and media regulator then blocked Russians from accessing TV Rain and the independent radio station Echo of Moscow. Data reveals most Russians get their news from state media, and observers have expressed alarm that many Russians seem to believe the Kremlin's propaganda that Ukraine and NATO provoked Russia to conduct their so-called “special military operation” as officials have dubbed the attack a “liberation campaign”.
