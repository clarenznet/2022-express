Residents in Hermon, southwest Wales, erected dozens of flags in a show of solidarity with the war-torn nation. They were given to households in exchange for a donation to help families desperately trying to flee Ukraine amid invasion from Russia, but many were torn down over the weekend by cruel thugs, Wales Online reports. Cris Tomos, a councillor for the area who co-ordinated the fundraising, said: "I was truly shocked that someone would hold such strong feelings about our efforts to donate money for medical and humanitarian supplies to people living through the horrors of the war in Ukraine "To then leave a note suggesting that we support Nazi regimes is very disappointing - our fundraising campaign is totally non-political." The shocking vandalism has been reported to police. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said: "Dyfed-Powys Police is appealing for witnesses after a number of Ukrainian flags were stolen from properties in Hermon, Pembrokeshire, in the early hours of Sunday, 27th March 2022. "Three flags are believed to have been stolen, one of which was replaced with a note containing racist language. "Anyone with information that could help officers with their investigation is asked to report it to Dyfed-Powys Police, either online at: https://bit.ly/DPPContactOnline, by emailing 101@dyfed-powys.police.uk, or by calling 101. If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impaired text the non-emergency number on 07811 311 908. Quote reference: DPP/1346/28/03/2022/02/C.

People in Ukraine continue to endure an ongoing conflict brought upon them by Vladimir Putin’s Russia last month. Thousands of Ukrainians are believed to have died in the war so far, with support - financial, political, and emotional - being provided from people in different countries all over Europe and the rest of the world.
