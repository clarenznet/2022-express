The presenter, who left BBC Breakfast in September after 20 years, admitted that the experience had “terrified” her. Ex-soldier Carl Davies, 44, was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison in December last year after posting multiple “intimidating” messages “intended to maximise fear and distress” to the broadcaster and her daughter’s social media accounts over four days between July 14 and 17 2020. Louise explained: “It was very clear from the messages that this person knew exactly where we lived and had stood outside our front door.     “To say I was frightened just doesn’t really touch the surface. You are kind of on this high state of alert all the time. “You don’t know who they are so you don’t know that that person standing next to you isn’t them.” Speaking for the first time about the ordeal, Mia said: “I’m logged into mum’s Instagram account and suddenly loads of messages started coming. “They were all kind of just really offensive, calling us not very nice names and then they got much more graphic. It was the kind of actions that he wanted to do against me and mum which got really personal and they weren’t nice to read at all.” READ MORE... ‘Most reluctant’ Richard Madeley on wife Judy Finnigan’s TV absence [INSIGHT] ‘It’s history repeating’ George Clooney's warning over Meghan Markle [UPDATE] Martin Kemp would get ‘frustrated’ before wife Shirlie noticed warning [INSIGHT]        “I was kind of terrified… shaking.

He had previously been convicted in 2017 of stalking another woman and for biting his father on the arm in 2019, the court heard.

Although progress has been made people totally underestimate the impact stalking has on the victim. It cost me thousands to ‘escape’, I live with a certain amount of fear every day, never taken seriously. Well done for speaking out.” (sic) Andy Morgan added: “Congratulations for raising awareness of this despicable crime.” Louise Minchin: The Truth About Stalking is on ITV tonight at 8:30pm.
