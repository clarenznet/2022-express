The question is put to men before their radiotherapy, X-Rays or MRI scans. Such a bizarre inquiry is the result of a Government move to swap the word "female" for "individual" in laws linked to the procedures. Medics at the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Liverpool have been told they now have to ask "ALL patients under the age of 60, regardless of how you may identify your gender" if they could be expecting a baby.  Supporting the trend among NHS trusts is a leaflet published by the Society of Radiographers in November, which states: "Heath professionals should be aware ofâ€¦ uterine transplants as a potential for pregnancy." Campaign group Sex Not Gender Nurses and Midwives, which advocates "an evidence-based approach to gender and sex", warned the move smacks of "misogyny". They also said it sets a dangerous precedent by prioritising self-identified gender. The group tweeted: "This shows disrespect for the complexity of pregnancy. It isn't simply having a uterus. Why are medical professionals using the language of gender identity, which is a theory? "We practise on evidence. We observe sex. It is not assigned."  In line with NHS guidance, patients can change their name and gender on official documents without taking legal action or having surgery. Nobody who is born male is capable of becoming pregnant - but Ryan Sanderson, 24, was nine weeks into his female-to-male transition when he found out he was pregnant with son Hendrick. He later said: "I think more trans men need to understand that they can get pregnant." A Department of Health spokesman said: "Patient safety is paramount, especially when there is a risk [to] foetuses [so] it's important all biological females of childbearing age are screened for potential pregnancy."
