Medics said that today -World Kidney Day - more than 4,600 patients are on the waiting list. Some 1,100 fewer transplants took place in 2020/21 - 32 percent down on the previous 12 months - including a 60 percent drop in living donations. A healthy person can lead a quite normal life with one functioning kidney. Around 1,000 living donations are made every year.  Alisha Gokani, 23, from Kent, was given one by her mum but her body rejected it. She now needs another and said: "Living donation is... something that shouldn't be taken lightly. I am kindly asking people to read more about organ donation." Anthony Clarkson, a director at NHS Blood and Transplant, urged people "to share your organ donation decision with your family".  AZEEM Ahmad was inspired to donate a kidney to a stranger after finding out that ex-footballer Andy Cole had needed a transplant. The 35-year-old mental health consultant from Newcastle was anxious, but said: "I'm so pleased I went through with the donation. I'm back to health and running again. I've called my remaining kidney 'Kevin' because he is Home Alone!" The recipient later wrote to thank him.
