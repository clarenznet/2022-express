Travel monitors are reporting huge delays and large queues on the stretch of busy motorway that runs between Bristol and Reading. The closure is in place between Junctions 15 and 16.  Traffic site Intrix said that vehicles have been stationary since 1.50pm. Wiltshire Police said just after 2pm that the road had been closed "while officers deal with an incident on an overbridge in Swindon". The force added: "Please avoid the area if possible." It is as yet unclear when the road will be reopened.   The closure not only means there are large queues of stationary traffic on the M4, but it is also having an impact on congestion in the surrounding area. Intrix warned just after 3pm that there was "congestion to routes through Swindon as traffic diverts from the closure".   National Highways has warned of long delays, and said that it had "resources in attendance to assist with traffic management". The stretch of affected motorway sits between Swindon and Reading, on the route between London and Bristol.
