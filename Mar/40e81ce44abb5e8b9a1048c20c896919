Having lost the toss against West Germany, who also wore white, the Three Lions donned their away kit which had white shorts with red socks. And the famous 4-2 Wembley win in red, which saw Geoff Hurst hammer in a hat-trick, has immortalised the Umbro design which has just been hailed as the most iconic sports kit with 36 per cent of the vote from sports fans. Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls jersey, in which he won six NBA championships, came second with 27 per cent while Usain Bolt's golden Puma running shoes he raced in to get triple golds at the 2016 Olympics came third. Other sporting outfits which captured our imaginations included Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean's floating, purple costumes they wore during their spellbinding Bolero to get ice skating gold at the 1984Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The All-Blacks' kit - first worn in 1893 - also made the top 20 with 21 per cent of the vote as did Muhammad Ali's white and black trim Everlast shorts, which he wore to knockout Sonny Liston for the World Heavyweight Championship in 1965.
