Since February 24, the heroic citizens of that sovereign nation have been bombarded by a bully armed to the teeth, and while they show no signs of giving in, they desperately need the world's assistance. One way that we can all help is by boycotting Russia. The Government is playing its part with its sanctions programme but some companies persist in trading with Putin's vile regime. This is why The Daily Express is today launching its Take A Stand Against Russia campaign, urging those firms still doing business with Russia to desist. While many have already divested in Russia, some are still trading, McDonald's, KFC and Est√©e Lauder among them. They should stop doing so with immediate effect. Along with several other MPs, ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has also urged firms to suspend their operations in Russia, following the examples of companies including H&M, Nike, Ikea and Apple.
