United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has said it now expects the global economy to grow by 2.6 percent, having previously expected to see an expansion of 3.6 percent.

Recent reports of empty shelves in Spanish supermarkets have caused some Brexit supporters to question why Brexit was ever blamed for shortages on British shelves when there may have been other issues at play. Twitter user, @jfwduffield, responded to one report about Spanish supermarket shortages by writing: "Brexit strikes again." @ItsonlymeClara said: "Must be because of Brexit. Oh hang on…" @notayesmansecon wrote: "It is amazing what Brexit has done!"
