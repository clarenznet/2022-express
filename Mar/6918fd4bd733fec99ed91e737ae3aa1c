Social media images and video show passengers being rushed out of the airport, and fire engines and fighters at the scene. Twitter users have claimed security is escorting passengers out of the airpot over reports of a fire. Manchester Airport provided a statement to Express.co.uk saying the evacuation occurred because of a fire alarm. They said: "The T1 departure lounge was briefly evacuated due to a fire alarm at one of the food outlets. “Around 200 passengers had to be re-screened and flights were held for them. “The incident was stood down at around 6.15pm.” Greater Manchester Combined Authority also told Express.co.uk a fire engine from Wythenshawe attended the scene, but “there was no support needed from GMFRS and firefighters soon left”. DJ Hattie Pearson uploaded a video to Twitter where you can hear an alarm going off in the background. A tannoy announcer can also be heard stating that "an incident has arisen" which requires the "immediate evacuation" of the terminal. Hattie tweeted: "Just been evacuated from an area of T1 at Manchester airport because of an incident. Hope everyone/everything is alright."
