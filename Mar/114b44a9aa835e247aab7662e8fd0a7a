Michael Caine, 89, was snapped on a date night with his beloved wife Shakira Caine, 74, earlier this week. The pair headed out for dinner on Tuesday night as Michael was spotted holding onto his walking stick. The glamorous couple went out in Mayfair, attending the glitzy Scotts restaurant. Michael donned a dark blue suit and a light blue shirt for the occasion. The Inception actor also wore his trademark specs and trainers to complete his look. While Shakira wore a simple black suit paired with black high heels.  The former model clutched a statement red handbag as she headed out of the restaurant. It seemed Hollywood legend Michael had a bit of trouble walking as he gripped his walking stick and bodyguard as they exited the restaurant. However, the actor, who recently turned 89, seemed in good spirits as he spoke to his wife. Michael underwent surgery earlier this year amid his painful back condition.  This was confirmed by his wife Shakira who told reporters at the recent launch of Sir Michael Caine: The Personal Collection.

Shakira explained: “He had a back operation quite recently. DON'T MISS...

According to the NHS, it can cause the squeezing of the spinal nerves. This can result in back pain, leg pain and weakness in your legs.  However, at the time, Shakira said he was recovering well. She added on March 2: “He’s great, he’s recovering. “He’s a strong man, he’s a lion, actually. “The operation was fantastic. He’ll be up and dancing again soon,” she added to the Daily Mail.
