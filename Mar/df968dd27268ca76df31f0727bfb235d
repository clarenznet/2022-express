His brilliant delivery of the furlough scheme spared families the horror of joblessness during Covid, and now he faces the challenge of protecting the nation's finances while war is raging in Europe. As Mr Sunak has made clear on repeated occasions, he understands the importance of minimising the tax burden on families and businesses. But he will not steer the country into the economic danger zone in pursuit of good headlines and cheers from backbenchers. He has a compassionate heart and a cool head - key qualities for any great Chancellor.Today we expect to see him take action to help households suffering from the cost of living crisis while also ensuring that essential public services are on a sound financial footing. There are many reasons to have confidence in both Mr Sunak and the economy. Crucially, we have remarkably low unemployment; navigating the challenges of high inflation would be much more difficult if the UK was in the grip of mass joblessness. With the right leadership, our reputation as a bastion of sound finances will be maintained, putting us in a perfect position to make the most of exciting trade deals. Mr Sunak has won the trust of millions of people who watched him navigate one of the country's greatest peacetime emergencies, and we expect that today's Spring Statement will make the country glad that he is in No 11.
