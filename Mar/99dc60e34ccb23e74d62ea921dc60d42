Jeremy Clarkson and his Clarkson’s Farm co-star Kaleb Cooper have been busy filming the second series of their show. Earlier today, The Grand Tour presenter shared a behind-the-scenes look at his co-star. Jeremy posted a picture on his Instagram account of Kaleb driving his tractor around the Diddly Squat farm. However, the star was forced to keep his doors open as a result of the hot weather. Jeremy explained in his caption: “His door’s open. “Anyone would think his air con has broken.”  Taking to his Instagram account yesterday, Kaleb had shared how his air-con had broken. Earlier today, he was feeling the impact of this as he struggled with the heat. The UK is currently experiencing something of a heatwave, which is unlucky timing for Kaleb. Posting on his Instagram stories, he shared a video of the issue.  Kaleb could be seen fanning himself as he said: “It’s f*****g hot. “I look like a tomato.” He then shared how he had been unable to open his windows as he’d been spraying crops. He penned: “Can’t open windows and doors as I’m spraying.” DON'T MISS...
