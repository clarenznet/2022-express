Lord Agnew stepped down from his role in the House of Lords, saying he could not defend actions over bounceback loans. The Treasury has written off Â£4.3billion worth of fraud. He told the Treasury select committee: "I could not stand up with any great integrity and say we did a great job, because we hadn't. On the fraud side, it was just a Dad'sArmy operation." Lord Agnew said it took officials "six weeks" to create a system that could catch fraudsters making duplicate claims but "60 percent of the money had already gone out of the door". He added: "It was happy days if you were a crook in those first few months."
