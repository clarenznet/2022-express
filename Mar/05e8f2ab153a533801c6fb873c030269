Daria Kaleniuk was close to tears as she repeatedly pressed the Prime Minister for Western fighter jets to provide cover for refugees. Mr Johnson insisted the UK was doing everything possible to help Ukraine but ruled out anything that could bring direct conflict with the Russian military. Ms Kaleniuk made her plea during a news conference in Warsaw yesterday. She also attacked the UK for not hitting Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch owner of Chelsea FC, with sanctions. The boss of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre told Mr Johnson: “Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of World War Three but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit.” She said: “Ukrainian women and children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone. “You are talking about more sanctions, Prime Minister, but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.” Mr Johnson apologised to Ms Kaleniuk for the “tragedy and suffering” in Ukraine. He welcomed her question and was “glad” she had made it to Poland, saying he was “conscious that there is not enough we can do as the UK Government to help in the way that you want”. Mr Johnson argued for “tightening the economic noose” around the Russian regime and providing further defensive support to Kyiv.
