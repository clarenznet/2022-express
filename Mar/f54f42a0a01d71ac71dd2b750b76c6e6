And when it comes to his workouts, he has a definite favourite. "High intensity interval training (HIIT) is my favourite type of workout and it's the most effective training method for burning fat," Wicks shared. "Not only does it get your heart rate fired up like nothing else, but it also boosts your metabolism and will get you super fit by improving your cardiovascular fitness." He created a two-week HIIT exercise regime that has numerous benefits, including improving stamina and increase your endurance. And it's designed for all levels of fitness.
