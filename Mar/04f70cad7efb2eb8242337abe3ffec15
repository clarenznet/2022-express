Sitting in my regular place, settling down for the night, opening my regular menu - I discovered there was nothing regular about it at all.  Next to my Friday night, guilty pleasure was a newly printed calorie count. 1600 calories, optional 160 for mushy peas. Really? What if I don’t have the batter? What does that drop the count by? What if I don’t have the chips? Or even the fish? For all of us with a sensitive disposition, you need to be aware that those figures will be in all large pubs, takeaways and restaurants from April 6. Greene King appears to be ahead of the pub pack. In fact, I went online to find their full breakdown of extras, side dishes, starters and puddings. All the meals’ calories looked high, which gave me some strange feeling of comfort. Supposedly this calorie shaming is to help with the country’s obesity levels as we become a country of fatties - 2 out of 3 adults are either overweight or obese along with 1 in 3 children - and also to guide us all to be healthier and have a balanced diet.  I was planning to just order a portion of chips (640 calories) and a glass of wine (150)  - with the battered fish being 1000 calories it was the biggest number to dump - when I was saved from this madness, discovering in the small print of these new calorie regulations a provision that said businesses are to provide a menu without calorie information at the express request of customers who may find viewing calories difficult. Hooray! That’s me sorted.  Pass me the old menu and let me enjoy my Friday night.
