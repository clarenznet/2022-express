From Sunday, travellers and crew can skip them on journeys "where masks are no longer legally required both ends of the route". It means that mandatory face coverings will be dropped on UK domestic flights - excluding to and from Scotland, where mask rules remain. And they will not be needed on flights between the UK and Denmark, Gibraltar, Iceland and Hungary. The carrier said: "EasyJet is really pleased to see the start of a return to truly restriction-free flying for UK consumers." British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, TUI and Jet2 have relaxed mask rules recently.
