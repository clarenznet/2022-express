Make it wet and just rub on the glass, amazing.” Samantha Stewart suggested: “Dishwasher tablets work amazingly.” Doreen Taylor said: “Dishwasher tablets are brilliant.” Susan Louise agreed: “I love using dishwasher tablets to clean my oven door. It’s so cheap and easy, I was amazed by the results.” Dishwasher tablets are made of concentrated dishwasher detergent and promise to cut through tough grease and leave dishes sparkling, so it makes sense that those powerful cleaning agents work on oven grease and food stains. Especially since the tablets promise to remove baked-on food and stains in the oven are definitely baked-on. Plus, the hard powder tablets have an abrasive surface that helps to scour away those stuck-on stains but is gentle enough not to scratch the oven glass. Dishwasher tablets can be picked up from supermarkets for £1 for 18 tablets. This works out as 6p per dishwasher tablet. Another Mrs Hinch fan suggested using more natural methods such as baking soda and white vinegar. Natasha Clarke commented: “White vinegar and baking soda to form a paste and leave on for a few minutes.” Debbie Phillips added: “Use baking soda and add white vinegar to make it into a paste and let it sit on the glass for a few hours. Then wipe clean and your oven door glass will be good as new.”
