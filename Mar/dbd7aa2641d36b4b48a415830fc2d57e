It was the first high-level acknowledgement of what campaigners call a scandal. Mr Johnson was put on the spot at Prime Minister's Questions by MP Peter Dowd, who earlier attended a meeting led by actress Ruthie Henshall to demand new laws so loved ones do not face dying alone in care homes. Mr Johnson promised to meet the Labour MP to discuss the crisis, saying: "Everybody understands the anguish of people who haven't been able to see their loved ones." Ruthie, 55, said the abandonment of older people will never be forgotten and yesterday described the crisis as "criminal". She headed a delegation from pressure group Rights for Residents, Relatives & Residents Association and John's Campaign who described the desperation that still persists. Bereaved families say all vulnerable people desperately need a legal right to a care supporter. Whether a relative or friend, they would help them wherever needed, in hospitals, care homes or GP surgeries.  Ruthie said: "It should not take hundreds and thousands of families to shout, loudly and consistently to those in power, that we need to do the right thing and not leave people in care on their own. "Our anger, hurt and betrayal will not be forgotten." The West End star has become a vocal activist and champion of older people's rights after her mother Gloria died in care last May. Tory MP Tracey Crouch, 46, who co-chaired yesterday's meeting, said: "We must recognise in law the crucial role family carers play in the lives of people in vulnerable situations."
