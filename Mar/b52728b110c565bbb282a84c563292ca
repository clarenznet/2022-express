The 2019 vote saw MPs assume control over the Parliamentary timetable with a series of "indicative votes" for alternatives to Ms May's Brexit deal. Over the last week of March, they deliberated - unsuccessfully - on a series of options to replace the PM's proposed deal. But they cemented their control over the Government's Brexit plans, with Parliament able to ratify the EU Withdrawal bill and eventually force Boris Johnson to seek an extension from the bloc. In the years following the amendment, the country has realised its Brexit goal, with the UK and EU officially parting ways on January 1, 2021. And despite a shaky start, Mr Johnson has successfully passed his Brexit-related bills with backing from his 80-seat strong Conservative majority. However, several issues remain, as the Government hopes to renege on aspects of its negotiated agreement. HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
