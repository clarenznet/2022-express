In a video from Ukraine, reportedly filmed by a Russian soldier, a unit of the Russian army seems left in its fate. Soldiers speaking say that they are abandoned in an area for several days, without tents, food, or water, only surviving on dry rations. The soldiers can be heard saying: “We haven’t eaten properly in three or four days! We are abandoned here for how many days? Three or four… “We are waiting to be transported over the border. For three days we are being told we'll be taken away, but no one is taking us home.” And they continue: “We are now being told to sign some paperwork, saying they want us fired, so they could cover themselves. No one agrees to their discussions." The soldier also says on video that the army isn’t picking up the bodies of dead soldiers.

Here. Our feet are all soaking. We don't know what to do. “This is how they work. They just want to cover their a***s. This is the Army of Russia!” Michael Kofman, who is the director of Russia Studies at the CNA, an american nonprofit research organisation, commented on Twitter that the video is “another example of why morale is likely to be low among Russian forces.” Mr Kofman said that it shows “poorly supplied troops, in bad conditions, who appear disgruntled and feel betrayed.” DON'T MISS: Russian soldiers 'crying in combat' show trust in Putin has collapseRussian soldier sobs humiliated by Ukrainians in video'We're cannon fodder' Captured Russian troops in tears
