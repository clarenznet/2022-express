In January, an adult skier was charged with the manslaughter of a five-year-old British girl in a deadly crash at the resort of Flaine, also in Haute-Savoie. The child, Ophélie, was in a lesson on the slopes when a man, a volunteer firefighter, is said to have crashed into her at high speed. Witnesses said they watched the 40-year-old suspect, who has not been identified, "skiing at high speed" over "a slight bump" and then colliding with the child. Following the collision, the skier tried to administer first-aid to Ophélie but she never recovered consciousness and died en route to the hospital.
