They crossed into Poland after queuing for 10 hours at the border before driving through Europe and arriving in Liverpool, via Ireland and Belfast, at the start of March. They have since applied for asylum and are now living in one hotel room in east London. After help from well-wishers and Mayor of Newham Rokhsana Fiaz, eldest boys Vlad, 14, and Roman, 12, got places at Cumberland Community School in London’s Forest Gate. They met new classmates and teachers last week and were given uniforms, laptops and books, paid for by the school. The school, part of the Community Schools Trust, is renowned for helping pupils win scholarships to fee-paying schools including Eton. Little brother Tymofii, four, will go to a nearby primary. Mum Oksana said the boys now had some normality. “I cannot express my thanks for what this school and the people have done for us. I didn’t expect all they have given us. My boys will be the most respectful best students and will do their work. I will make sure of this as their mother.” Vlad said: “I can’t wait to start making friends and I want to join the football team. I will miss my friends at home but I am sure I can make new friends here. Everyone has been really nice to us so far.” Roman added: “I am very happy to be given a place at such a nice school.” Headteacher Omar Deria said the boys will get one-to-one English lessons, catch-up tuition and support with their wellbeing and mental health. Dad Dmytro, who had a swimming pool firm in Kyiv, said: “I am so grateful to the British Government and people for their kindness and welcome. But all I want to do is go home. I pray this war is over soon.”
