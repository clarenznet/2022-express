The “Nights On” film, which was shot on the grounds of Hertfordshire's Hatfield House Estate, sees the Essex-born singer strike a pose in a punk-inspired high-school outfit, featuring a tie, skirt, and knee-high socks. Directed by celebrated director Matilda Finn, the 90-second video follows an entourage of friends, alongside Charli XCX, as they enter an otherworldly dreamy night, exploring the darkness in stunning videography. It was created to mark the launch of Samsung’s new Galaxy S22 Series, featuring “Nightography” camera functionality. Charli XCX said: “That was one of the craziest films I have ever shot. “Skipping in a farmer’s field, surrounded by sheep, in the middle of the night was definitely a new experience for me. “This film is all about capturing the amazing and magical moments that happen when the sun goes down and celebrates the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S22 devices, which can capture incredible video at night.” Charles Jeffrey said: “The inspiration for my collection comes from my love of British nightlife and passion for music. “This collaboration with Samsung and Charli XCX celebrates the dreamlike experiences and memories of nightlife culture and nights out with friends.” Charles Jeffrey, known for his gender-fluid designs, showcases his latest Autumn/Winter 22 range in the film. The designer’s LOVERBOY collection is inspired by the British nightclub scene and his love of music, which he says unleashes his creativity and is the source of his ideas. The collaboration marks tech giant Samsung’s partnership with the British Fashion Council, which saw them become the “Official Technology Partner” for London Fashion Week. Alex Conaway, head of brand from Samsung UK, said: “We are thrilled to partner with these two extraordinary creative forces. “We’re excited to be exploring the world of fashion and pop culture through our devices, and this campaign will find a perfect home as part of our Innovation Tech Partnership with London Fashion Week.”
