Mr Sunak, ahead of his spring statement "mini-budget" on Wednesday, is reportedly looking for a way to recoup fuel duty.

Speaking to the Times, a source revealed Downing Street is “very seriously” looking at the method to "solve" issues caused by fuel duty. Any attempts to introduce a new selection of toll roads won't prove popular, as drivers already face record-high fuel prices.
