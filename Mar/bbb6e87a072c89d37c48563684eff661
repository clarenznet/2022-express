As the world begins to hammer down sanctions on Russia for its belligerent invasion of Ukraine, the question of how much the UK and Europe rely on Russian imports has come to the forefront. The UK imports all manner of goods from Russia - and not just oil and gas like many would expect. The EU is more reliant on imports from Russia than the UK - with the EU market being Russia’s largest export for gas. A quarter of the European Union's petroleum oil imports come from Russia and about 40 percent of the EU's natural gas imports. Yet, even as the incursion in Ukraine continues, Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but still accept its oil and gas exports. The UK actually gets much more than just oil and gas from Russia - with the UK’s share of both at three percent respectively.
