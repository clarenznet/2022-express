Terrified neighbours in Tuebrook, Liverpool, saw young men hurl bricks at the vehicle at around 5.30pm on Wednesday. Another man was seen on all fours on the bonnet of the car as it travelled at speed along the residential street. The car mounted the pavement as it accelerated at the thugs and appeared to leave the vicinity. It then appeared to return to the street and reverse into the property. Bricks and debris could be seen tumbling all over the car. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the collision, Liverpool Echo reports. One neighbour, who recorded the drama inÂ case anything happened to his wife who was due home, or his own property, said the scenes have left him "terrified". The dad, who has been living on a nearby road for 18 months, added: "We see men fighting in the road on the corner quite a lot but we have never had anything this bad. "I couldn't believe what I was seeing tonight. I have a wife and kids, its very scary. "When I looked out I saw all of this. I am terrified."  No one has been arrested in connection with the incident, Merseyside Police said. Officers continue to investigate though, as one house was subject to a cordon last night. Photographs taken by Liverpool Echo show the scene of devastation at the terraced house and neighbouring properties. A huge pile of rubble can seen outside the property which was hit.
