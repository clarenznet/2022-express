Laila Rouass, 50, stunned fans last night as she posted an intimate snap on social media. The former Strictly Come Dancing star, who revealed she had split from partner Ronnie O'Sullivan after 10 years together in February, appeared to be posing topless in her room in the jaw-dropping selfie. In view of her 32,000 followers, Laila gave the camera a fierce look that was enhanced by a dramatic smokey eye. She paired her eyeshadow with a nude lip and sharply sculpted eyebrows. The Footballers’ Wives actress styled her hair in loose tousled beach waves and side parting. She simply captioned the candid post: “Tuesday night.” Later in the night, she shared an update as she was about to tuck into a delicious meal for one, stating: “All mine”.
