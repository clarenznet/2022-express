Chris Mullin challenged an application by the West Midlands force to require him to disclose source material dating back to his investigation in 1985 and 1986. Speaking after an Old Bailey judge ruled he would not have to give up the information, Mr Mullin, 74, said that the right of a journalist to protect sources is "fundamental to a free press in a democracy". In his book, Error Of Judgement, and a series of documentaries, Mr Mullin helped expose one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British legal history, leading to the release of the Birmingham Six after their convictions were quashed in 1991. Twenty-one people were killed in bomb attacks on two pubs in Birmingham on November 21 1974. West Midlands Police used the Terrorism Act to bring the production order application. Handing down his ruling yesterday, the Recorder of London Judge Mark Lucraft said: "I decline to grant the production order sought." Mr Mullin said: "My actions, in this case, were overwhelmingly in the public interest. "They led to the release of six innocent men after 17 years in prison, the winding up of the notorious West Midlands Serious Crime Squad and the quashing of a further 30 or so wrongful convictions." He added: "My investigation is also the main reason why the identity of three of the four bombers is known."
