A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure, this severe increase to lead to the occurrence of a stroke. Dr Sheldon Sheps describes hypertensive crises as: "life threatening." As a result, it’s important to spot the symptoms so potentially life-saving treatment can be administered. Symptoms of a hypertensive crisis include, say the Mayo Clinic, severe chest pain and a severe headache; the latter will often be accompanied by confusion and blurred vision.

It is recommended that a person experiencing a hypertensive crisis should seek medical treatment as soon as possible.  One of the major risk factors for hypertension is age. Normally the older someone is the greater the likelihood of high blood pressure. However, BMJ has released a report into hypertension in younger patients. Young onset hypertension is a form of hypertension affecting young people. The BMJ says the condition can be caused by other types of hypertension such as essential hypertension and secondary hypertension. While secondary hypertension: “has an underlying pathological cause…[it] is not a diagnosis in itself.” A 2018 UK survey found just under three percent of people aged between 16 and 24 had hypertension. As to why so many young people are suffering from a form of hypertension is unclear. A number of factors such as diet, levels of activity, and mental health can have an impact on the blood pressure of an individual. Lifestyle changes such as improving diet, cutting down on alcohol and caffeine, quitting smoking, exercising are ways to lower high blood pressure alongside the potential use of prescription medication.
