Mr Bezos, the world's richest man, started holding private space trips via Blue Origin in 2021. He joined the crew for the first record-breaking flight in June that year, and two others have since followed. The next group of astronauts will follow them in a matter of hours. The latest spaceflight from Blue Origin is the fourth so far since its first successful launch. The New Shepard spacecraft will carry a team of six into space tomorrow on March 29, five of whom paid for the privilege. Those not aboard or watching from the ground from the Texas Van Horn launch site can view their journey online. READ MORE: Jeff Bezos earnings: How much does Jeff Bezos make in a day? Blue Origin has scheduled tomorrow's flight for 9.30am EDT, 4.30pm BST in the UK. The company runs a dedicated live stream from its official site on the day, usually starting an hour beforehand. Anyone who would prefer to catch it elsewhere can also tune in via the Blue Origin YouTube channel. Other media organisations such as Space.com have announced they will carry a feed courtesy of the company. Of the six people flying into space, five are paying customers, and one is a longtime Blue Origin employee. Gary Lai joined Blue Origin in 2004 and currently serves as the senior director and chief architect of the New Shepard system. He has served a storied career with a previous role at NASA and will replace Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson tomorrow. The remaining passengers include a mix of entrepreneurs, investors and commercial space firm chiefs. They are likely among the few people who can afford the trip, as estimates suggest each one comes with a hefty price tag. The first-ever seat on a Blue Origin craft sold at auction for $28 million (£21.3 million) to an anonymous bidder. In 2018, Reuters reported that each ticket would cost people between $200,000 to $300,000 (£152,000 to £229,000). Those estimates would bring the tickets closer to the prices outlined by other space tourism firms. Virgin Galactic, run by billionaire Richard Branson, offers flight reservations for $250,000 (£190,000). Both Virgin and Blue Origin offer sub-orbital flights and don't take their passengers into space. Only the space firm Axiom is offering trips to the International Space Station for $55 million (£42 million).
