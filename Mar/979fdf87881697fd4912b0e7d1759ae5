An inspection of Ampleforth College, in North Yorks, found pupils with special needs had engaged in sexual activity during lessons, a claim the school said was untrue, citing a police report. It also said class A drugs were found on the site after an illicit Year 13 leavers' party. And there were fears over safeguarding pupils from monks nearby who were accused of or found guilty of child abuse, a claim the school denied. The report said "despite these significant failings" there had been some improvement in safeguarding. Head Robin Dyer said: "Ampleforth is a safe school. Our students know it and our parents and staff know it too."
