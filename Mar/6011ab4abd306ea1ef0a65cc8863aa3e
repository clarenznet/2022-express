Wales today banned “reasonable chastisement” as a defence for hitting – and the YouGov poll said adults in England back that, with 64 percent stating children and grown-ups must have the same protection against assault. Some 58 percent think it is already illegal to smack, while 20 percent knew it is still legal and 22 percent could not say. The NSPCC said that last year more than 500 counselling sessions were delivered by Childline after youngsters reported being hit by parents or carers. Some said punishment became more severe as they got older. A girl of 16 told the charity: “When I was younger and I misbehaved, my mum gave me a warning. “Then when I got to around five to 12 years old, it was a tap.Now it can be a proper smack. “There was one occasion where she pulled my hair and I fell to the floor and she continuously hit me. I don’t want to get mum in trouble but I can’t carry on being afraid of her.” University College London analysed 20 years of research and concluded physical punishment not only did not improve behaviour, it increased behavioural difficulties such as aggression. The NSPCC wants Westminster politicians to follow Wales’s lead and change the law. Sir Peter Wanless, chief executive, said: “Today is a landmark moment for children in Wales. “They are some of the most vulnerable members of our society and deserve more, not less, protection from violence. “Public attitudes to physical punishment are changing.” The ban which came into force in Wales today includes smacking, hitting, slapping and shaking. It was brought in under the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act 2020. Youngsters now enjoy the same protection from assault as adults, and the law also applies to visitors to Wales. Anyone who is responsible for a child and then hits them will face criminal or civil charges.
