  Lily, 32, appeared with her co-star Sebastian Stan, 39, who portrays rock star Tommy Lee in the series. Pam & Tommy tells the story behind Pamela Anderson’s infamous leaked sex tape, which was stolen from the safe in the basement of their Malibu home in 1995. Lily looked stunning as she posed in a sheer floor-length gold dress. The garment featured a plunging neckline giving a glimpse of her cleavage and featured a sheer skirt and belted waist to accentuate her narrow torso.  The skirt and top featured delicate metallic details, while the neck and straps were decorated with gold sequins. Lily’s hair was tied back in a sleek ponytail, while she opted for white polish on her nails. The actress wore a subtle smokey eye, nude lip and delicate gold earrings to complete the look. Her co-star, Marvel actor Sebastian, looked suitably handsome in a pink velvet suit and blush shirt.
