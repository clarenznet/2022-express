Simon Coveney was delivering the keynote speech at the Building Common Ground event organised by the John and Pat Hume Foundation at the Houban Centre when he was abruptly ushered out.  The venue on Crumlin Road has been evacuation. An organiser said a suspect device was discovered in the car park. Tim Attwood, from the Hume Foundation, said: "There is a security alert and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are currently assessing the situation. "Everyone has had to evacuate the centre."  It has been reported that a white van has been hijacked and the driver held at gun point with something put in the back and told to drive to the centre. Police are at the scene and a cordon is in place. People have been urged to avoid the area. A spokesperson for the PSNI said: "Police are currently in attendance of a security alert at the Crumlin Road area of north Belfast. "Motorists are advised to avoid the area and seek alternative main routes for their journey. "There are no further details at this stage." Mr Attwood added that the security alert is a reminder "to everyone that there is no role in our society for violence". He said: "A suspect device will not stop the work of the John and Pat Hume Foundation." An attendee told Belfast Live: "The event kicked off and all of a sudden Simon Coveney’s security came up and he left. "A guy was outside who’d been badly shaken up who said that his van was hijacked and the van is in the car park now. "A van was driven into the car park at the chapel grounds and police are all there now." Mr Coveney had been speaking about the importance of reconciliation in Northern Ireland. He had told the event: "The patient work of reconciliation and deepening of relationships does need to continue on our own island." A spokesperson for Mr Coveney said he was taken to a "safe place".
