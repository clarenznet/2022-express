Prince William returned from his eight-day tour around the Caribbean on Saturday. He and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge embarked on a trip across the Commonwealth realms in celebration of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The royal couple’s responsibilities have ramped up in recent months due to concerns surrounding the Queen’s health. With his place in the line of succession secured upon birth, William began his training for the role of King early — under the guidance of his grandmother, the Queen.It’s been reported that Her Majesty would have the Duke at Windsor Castle, where the pair would open the state boxes and go through the papers.The Duke was educated in the basics of kingly duties throughout his childhood and into his teenage years.However, the Queen is William’s grandmother after all — a resurfaced interview with the Prince shows that the royals are just like other families, and that being an heir to the throne doesn’t exempt you from a telling off. In an interview with Sky News for ‘The Queen at 90’ documentary, William told the story of a childhood incident when he and his cousins, Peter and Zara Phillips, got into trouble at Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate.He recalled: “We were chasing Zara around, who was on a go-cart, and Peter and I managed to herd Zara into a lamppost.“And the lamppost came down and nearly squashed her, and I remember my grandmother being the first person out at Balmoral running across the lawn in her kilt; [she] came charging over and gave us the most almighty b*********, and that sort of stuck in my mind from that moment on.”William also noted his close bond with his grandmother, and the Queen’s strong female influence in his life, following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. He said: “Having lost my mother at a young age, it’s been particularly important to me that I’ve had somebody like the Queen to look up to and who’s been there and who has understood some of the more complex issues when you lose a loved one.”The matriarch of the monarchy has taken a step back from her royal duties in recent months.Following a health scare in October, which kept the Queen in hospital for an overnight stay, Her Majesty’s schedule has been dramatically reduced.The monarch has made the permanent move to Windsor Castle, and carries out virtual engagements from home.
