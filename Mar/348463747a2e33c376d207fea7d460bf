Sam Elliott is currently known for his stirring performance as ageing cowboy Shea Brennan in Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone spin-off, 1883. With another season already in the works for Paramount+, the Hollywood veteran has caught flak from fans by opening fire at Best Picture frontrunner The Power of the Dog for revamping the Western genre. 1883 star Sam took shots at the Oscar-nominee for Jane Campion’s subversive take on classic cowboy archetypes. Benedict Cumberbatch stars in the acclaimed period drama as ranch-owner Phil Burbank, the verbally abusive brother of Jesse Plemons’ George. Phil’s complex history with an unseen mentor named Bronco Henry is eventually revealed when Jesse moves his new wife and her effeminate son into their ranch house. In his recent appearance on Marc Maron’s podcast, Sam criticised the film for its location and portrayal of men working in the American West.

The podcast host inquired: “You didn’t like that one?” Sam replied: “F**k no. Why? I’ll tell you why I didn’t like it anyway.” The Western favourite revealed his dislike for The Power of the Dog grew whilst he was filming his role in 1883 in Montana. He recalled: “There was a f*****g full-page ad out in the LA Times and there was a review, not a review, but a clip, and it talked about the ‘evisceration of the American myth.’ “And I thought, ‘What the f**k? What the f**k?’ This is the guy that’s done Westerns forever.” Sam is well-known for his roles as cowboys and outlaws in landmark Western films such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Tombstone and The Quick and the Dead. Although The Power of the Dog has received rave reviews for its reflective take on the genre, the star didn’t believe it held up to the standards of the films that came before.

They made it look like - what are all those dancers, those guys in New York who wear bowties and not much else. Remember them from back in the day?” Marc clarified he was referring to Chippendales dancers, to which Sam fumed: “That’s what all these f*****g cowboys in that movie look like. “They’re all running around in chaps and no shirts. There’s all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the f*****g movie.” Sam also wasn’t impressed with New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion’s decision to shoot the film in her home country rather than its setting, Montana. “She’s a brilliant director, by the way, I love her work, previous work,” he clarified. “But what the f**k does this woman from down there, New Zealand, know about the American west? “And why in the f**k does she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana and say, ‘This is the way it was.’ That f*****g rubbed me the wrong way, pal.” Express.co.uk has contacted Sam Elliott's representatives for comment on his remarks. Meanwhile, The Power of the Dog is the frontrunner at this year’s Oscars, leading the pack with 12 nominations alongside the likes of Dune, Belfast and Don’t Look Up. Y 1883 is available to stream on Paramount+ in the USA. A UK release date has yet to be announced. The Power of the Dog is available to stream on Netflix.
