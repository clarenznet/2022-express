Arthur Edwards, who is a photographer with The Sun, toldÂ news.com.au's 'I've Got News For You' podcast that he has a strong relationship with members of the Royal Family, having toured with the British royal family for more than 40 years. The years he spent with the family means he knows what they are really like. Mr Edwards claimed spending time with the Sussexes was "depressing." He said: "Camilla would always say hello, Kate says hello, William, yeah, they're all very friendly and so was Harry until he met Meghan, and then he became very very distant and he became almost, well, it was miserable. I just find it very depressing with them. They just hated the media and it was miserable so I ducked out of them and sort of went with Charles to New Zealand and you know places like that."
