Charles, 73, left wife Camilla in stitches as he struggled to pour his stout and was then left with froth on his nose after being too eager to drink it. The couple, who will tour Ireland next week, got in some practice at the Irish Cultural Centre in west London, ahead of St Patrick's Day tomorrow. There they learnt to play the bodhran - a traditional drum - by musician Tad Sargent. They also joined a singsong of Mountains of Mourne, with Charles revealing it was a favourite of his grandmother. Talking to a knitting group, the prince confessed he tried to learn the craft aged "six or seven" but "failed miserably". But it was at the bar the heir to the throne looked most at ease as he volunteered to pour a pint, but at first struggled to get a grip of tilting the glass. His impatience got the better of him after barmaid Jude Hynes made him wait for his Guinness to settle.
