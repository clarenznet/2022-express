The clocks will be one hour ahead from 1am tomorrow, on Sunday, March 27. The shift has coincided, rather unfortunately, with Mother’s Day – a day when mums across the country are supposed to enjoy a little more – not less – rest. Many Britons have taken to social media to express their “outrage”. Alison McCallum fumed in a post on Twitter: “Even if mums think they can sneak in a wee extra hour lie in, it’s not really.” JT described the moving of the clocks as a “harsh gift” on Mother’s Day. Drumm100 added: “Mother’s Day AND the clocks going forward couldn’t have fallen any worse.” Guetta Grip~Heather~ joked: “The time goes forward an hour on MOTHER’S DAY! “Dads get a full 24 hrs… but mums only end up with 23?!” She asked: “How did we let this happen girls! They took it right from under our noses!” Ms M was also determined to know “what sadist decided that Mother’s Day should be the same day the clocks go forward”.

She wrote: “My Mother’s Day gift to my mum is that I’m going to change the oven clock because it always winds her up that I don’t.” DON'T MISS: Boris urged to cut the ‘soundbites’ and focus on action [OPINION] Tory civil war erupts as Scottish Conservatives REFUSE to back Boris [REPORT] Prince Andrew legal settlement with Giuffre 'will have been millions' [REVEAL] It appears there are also other reasons to be frustrated with the changing of the clocks, with Mail on Sunday columnist, a long-time critic of the annual shift to ‘British Summer Time’, insisting the “annual festival of unreason” should come to an end. In his latest column, he wrote pushing the clocks forward gives “everyone jet-lag by forcing them to get up earlier”. The clocks will return to Greenwich Mean Time on October 30.
