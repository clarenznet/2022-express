Activists waved Ukrainian flags from a small boat in front of Solaris - a 459ft vessel valued at more than Â£400million - in port city Bodrum. The protesters were cleared, allowing the ship to dock. Solaris, which sails under a Bermuda flag, according to the website Marine Traffic, arrived on Monday afternoon, more than a week after leaving Montenegro. Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps vowed to do "all I can to cripple Russia's aviation and shipping industries" after Gibraltar seized a superyacht owned by billionaire oligarch Dmitry Pumpyansky. Mr Shapps said: "We cannot stand idly by while Vladimir Putin tramples over a sovereign, democratic country, laying waste to homes and hospitals. My message to Putin and his cronies is loud and clear - there is nowhere to hide."
