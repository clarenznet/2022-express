Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has insisted that the all-new Mercedes W13 appears to be within the rules despite questioning its legality on the first day of pre-season testing in Bahrain. The Silver Arrows raised plenty of eyebrows when they arrived at the start of Thursday's morning session with a heavily upgraded version of the car that was used in last month's three-day shakedown at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. The sidepods of the W13 are now virtually non-existent in an unprecedented innovation that has turned no shortage of heads across the paddock.The new design helps to optimise airflow over the bodywork to ultimately provide an increase in straight-line speed.It was a major talking point on Thursday as Lewis Hamilton got behind the wheel in the morning before George Russell was tasked with putting the W13 through its paces in the afternoon.Horner was said to have been left frustrated by Mercedes' new development and was quoted by various outlets as having suggested that it may have been illegal during the early stages of the day's running.However, the Red Bull boss has since backtracked on his earlier comments by underlining his belief that the W13 appears to tick all boxes.

It’s quite a different concept to certainly the concept that we pursued and I think some of the others have."It shows the creativity that exists even within constrictive regulations in Formula One that very different solutions are coming out now."Whether it’s the right route, or whatever, only time will tell and I think what we see in Formula One is that there tends to be convergence over a period of time on design philosophies. "But what’s so good about this sport is you get a clean sheet of paper, you get 10 different interpretations. Mercedes have come up with an extreme one that’s a different interpretation."But to answer your next question of whether we think it is legal or not, yes absolutely, it looks like it ticks all the boxes."Red Bull moved quickly to play down Horner's previous comments by insisting that he did not speak in any interviews about Mercedes on Thursday.The Austrian team went on to soften their stance, though, by releasing a statement in which they claimed they had made no official comment regarding the W13 and would not be doing so.

It's obviously a fairly different concept, but that's for the aero guys and designers to get into."
