Education bosses say that Nessie reinforces negative stereotypes of the Scots. Pupils north of the border will learn that class structure had a role in the creation of the legend. And they will be told stories surrounding the creature may have shaped attitudes to Scottish independence and even the ColdWar. The claims about Nessie come in a 17-page social studies lesson plan to help secondary schools teach what the monster's portrayal in films says about Scotland's image and how it affects "wider contemporary topics". The material aims to help 11 to 14-year-olds "recognise persuasion and bias". It asserts the monster was "designed as a tourist attraction to appeal to the motoring middle classes" in the Depression. Sightings of Nessie date from the 6th century but the phenomenon exploded in the 1930s with an avalanche of alleged sightings and photos. The first movie about Nessie was 1934's horror The Secret Of The Loch. The lesson plan claims the movie monster "shows the somewhat ambivalent position that Scotland holds in the Union". It adds: "The very idea of a prehistoric monster in a loch affirms the stereotypical idea that Scotland - by contrast to England - is a rural wilderness, perhaps one bypassed by progress." But Chris McGovern, from the Campaign for Real Education, said: "It presents anti-British bias. It seeks to brainwash pupils into believing Scotland is the victim of a wicked conspiracy to subvert and infantilise its identity." Education Scotland said: "The resource encourages students to debate, to analyse bias and understand the role film has played in shaping the global view of Scotland."
