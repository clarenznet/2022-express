"Officers attended and a male in his 20s was located with two stab wounds and was taken to hospital. His injuries are not believed to be serious.

MEN reporter James Holt, on the scene, said that the cordon had been in place since 6.15pm this evening. A police helicopter had been sighted over the area, he said, and that as of 8.20pm crime scene investigators were making their way onto the scene.  One eyewitness told the outlet they saw a quick response, with eleven police officers swooping in shortly after the incident.

Today's incident is the latest in a spate of stabbings across the country.    Four people lost their lives to violence across the country in under 18 hours this weekend. Three men were fatally stabbed while a fourth is believed to have died from injuries sustained during a pub fight. The stabbings took place in Bournemouth, Bury and Birmingham.    Meanwhile, a 14-year-old boy was charged with murder on Friday after a man was fatally stabbed outside an Asda supermarket in Redditch. West Mercia Police said Ian Kirwan, 53, was attacked on Jinnah Road in Redditch, Worcestershire, around 7.20pm on Tuesday.
