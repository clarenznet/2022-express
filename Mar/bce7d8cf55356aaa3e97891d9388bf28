Vernon Kay, 47, left Radio 2 listeners stunned when he accidentally gushed over Soft Cell singer Marc Almond’s “amazing” duet with “Jimmy Savile”. The presenter was trying to reference the singer Jimmy Somerville and quickly apologised for his slip of the tongue, but his mistake was quickly picked up by Twitter users.   Reading a message to Marc from a listener called Andrew, Vernon said: “Morning Vernon, love Marc Almond. “Awesome voice and so unique - his music has helped me through some dark days. “I saw him at Pride and I think I was the first one at Hyde Park to run down and wait for him at the front. “Amazing… His duet with Jimmy Savile… Jimmy Somerville - apologies!"
