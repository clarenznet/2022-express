PEOPLE over 75 can get a fourth jab from next week as Sajid Javid promised to ramp up the fight against Covid. The Health Secretary said the boosters would be dished out from Monday after hospitalisations began to rise. Jabs will also go to care home residents and patients with weak immune systems. When asked if it would be widened to the general population, Mr Javid said: "I think at some point they will." He said that millions more may be eligible later this year, ahead of the third Covid winter. Mr Javid told ITV that ministers would follow advice from experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Mr Javid added: "Their most recent advice is they think towards the end of this year, maybe in the autumn, there will be a need to give a lot more people a boost, an offer of a boost." The JCVI suggested last month that the spring jab drive should cover all over-75s, care home residents and over- 12s with impaired immunity, roughly eight million people. It is six months since the third shot began being rolled out. Scotland embarked on its top-up campaign more than a week ago andWales started its spring boosters this week. Yesterday's UK figures show that 534,747 people tested positive in the previous seven days, up 43.9 per cent on the week before.
