The budget supermarket giant has brought back turkey dinosuars costing £1.59 a bag.  They feature nine turkey pieces shaped to look like recognisable dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. A similar treat - dinosaur chicken nuggets - were popular with children in the 1990s and people have celebrated this likeness on Facebook today. One post about them has received more than 1,700 likes and an astonishing 5,700 comments from fellow consumers. One said: "They are amazing and cook well in the air fryer". A second shared: "They are lovely, the kids love them. I've tried them myself." A third added: "My son likes them and didn't even know they was different to the more expensive ones." Another stated: "They were a hit last night with my little one! Who is extremely fussy." One nostalgic mum shared: "I used to love these were my favourite. I'm so glad to see they're back." The product's packaging is adorned with the Jurassic World logo, reports Glasgow Live.  It's unclear if the product will remain in Aldi's freezers once Jurassic World Dominion stops airing in UK cinemas. But the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise isn't scheduled for release until June 10 so shoppers preumably have plenty of time to enjoy the treats. Production and release of the adventure film, which stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Neill, was delayed significantly due to the Covid pandemic. The last movie in the popular franchise - Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - was a huge hit, making $1.310 billion (approximately £1 billion) in the box office in 2018.
