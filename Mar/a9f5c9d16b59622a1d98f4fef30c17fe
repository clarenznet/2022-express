The energy giant, which has apologised for last week buying cheap Russian oil, is closing all its service stations there. McDonald's is temporarily shutting all 850 restaurants but will pay its 62,000 workers. Boss Chris Kempczinski said the burger giant cannot ignore the "needless human suffering". The Daily Express has launched the Take A Stand Against Russia crusade to urge firms to sever links. KFC has come under fire online for not pulling out. Yum! Brands, which owns the chain, said it suspended all investment in the country but stopped short of saying it would close restaurants. It will direct Russian profits "to humanitarian efforts". Last week H&M, Nike and tech giant Apple cut ties.
