 Royal expert Jonathan Sacerdoti claims Prince Charles wants to “make some changes” to the Royal Family when he becomes king. The British monarchy has already undergone some structural changes under Queen Elizabeth II but Prince Charles wants to take this further.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their decision to step back as working royals in January 2020, a decision made permanent in February 2021. Earlier this year Prince Andrew lost his royal titles amid a sexual assault lawsuit, which has now been settled out of court. This came after he stepped back from royal duties in November 2019. Mr Sacerdoti believes Prince Charles will “formalise the slimming down” so that it doesn’t seem like the “result of circumstances.” The changes are thought to come into effect within a year of Charles’ accession.  Following the Queen’s medical advice to rest towards the end of last year, Prince Charles and Prince William have both been taking on more duties to pick up the slack. Mr Sacerdoti told US Weekly: "Prince Charles has always been a hardworking royal and Prince William too, but the more they get to do now, the more the baton is being handed over. “They’re getting used to some of those roles for when they themselves are monarch.” A royal source told US Weekly that Charles and William have agreed to “guide each other” in the reforming of the Royal Family so it resembles a European-style institution.
