But the star bowed out in style - in a gown by top designer Roberto Cavalli with a stunning buckled neckline. Lily, 32, who plays Pamela Anderson in the Hulu show, wasn't the only star to strut her stuff at the finale launch in Los Angeles. Sebastian Stan, Pam's husband Tommy Lee in the tale about the couple's infamous sex tape, wore a pink velvet suit. Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastian's co-star in new Hulu movie Fresh, went for a more classic look in a shimmering little black dress.
