The RSPCA was called to Ystrad Waun Common in Pencoed, Wales, on Sunday. The Shetland pony, who was with her foal, had injuries to both her hind legs and stomach and needed urgent veterinary care. Her foal was uninjured.  The charity believes the mare suffered the injuries in a dog attack. RSPCA inspector Christine McNeil said the suspected attack must have been "distressing" for the Shetland pony and her foal. Ms McNeil said: "The little skewbald Shetland mare had very serious injuries to both her hind legs and her stomach area from a suspected dog attack. "She also had a foal with her who appeared not to have been harmed in the attack. "A vet was called and gave her emergency treatment and I removed her and the foal to a safe location where she is undergoing further vet treatment. "Her wounds were reasonably fresh, so the attack would have occurred recently.

"If you can help us with our enquiries please can you call our inspector appeal line on 0300 123 80 18." The RSPCA is also trying to track down the pony's owner as there were no details registered on her microchip.

A spokesperson said: "The RSPCA urges dog owners to keep their pet under control and on a lead when near horses and livestock. "Whilst the vast majority of people take care as a matter of course, sadly accidents can happen and even the most docile and obedient dogs can get distracted and excited by grazing animals."
