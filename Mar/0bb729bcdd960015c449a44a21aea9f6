The licence for the Cambo field, off Shetland, had been due to expire today. A spokeswoman for the oil giant said: "The North Sea Transition Authority has awarded Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK an extension to the underlying licences containing the Cambo field."  Shell stated last December that economics meant it was withdrawing from the project. The spokeswoman said this position had not changed but the extension would "allow time to evaluate all potential future options". The war on Ukraine has forced Britain to reassess its energy sources. But Friends of the Earth Scotland said: "There is no safe future for new oil and gas production in the North Sea. Cambo must be rejected."
