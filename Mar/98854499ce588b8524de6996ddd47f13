Dame Joan Collins marked her 20th wedding anniversary with a star-studded event at the Claridge's hotel in London. The iconic actress and her beloved husband Percy Gibson, 56, exchanged their nuptials at the same venue two decades ago. Joan, 88, oozed glamour as she posed for pictures alongside her other half as the couple marked the occasion. The former Dynasty actress looked chic as she sported a floor-length silver gown. She accompanied her look with a pair of diamond earrings and rocked her brunette tresses in her signature style. Joan was all smiles as she stood beside Percy who looked equally smart in a black tuxedo. The happy couple was joined by a host of famous faces as they shared candid photos from their big night, including Simon Cowell, Liz Hurley and Sarah Ferguson. Joan and Percy opted for an Art Deco-themed white tie party that paid homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Speaking about the party which was held on February 17, Joan spoke to OK! magazine and dished on the glamorous event. She told the publication: â€œIt was fabulous. It was a perfect night."
