Yellowstone actor Kevin Costner, 67, and his beautiful wife Christine Baumgartner, 48, arrived at the Oscars on Sunday and had a brief wardrobe mishap when the latter's button got caught on his other half's lace gown. Thankfully, Kevin noticed before any damage could be done and took a few moments to loosen the tangled button that was on the bottom of his tuxedo sleeve. Kevin, who previously won Best Actor at the Oscars in 1991, looked dapper in a black suit with matching bow tie. He posed next to Christine, who he has been married to for almost 18 years, while she stunned in a glamorous grey gown with lace and beading details. The dress was complete with an off the shoulder design, which she accessorised with silver earrings and simple make-up to show off her natural beauty. Shaking off the blunder, The Bodyguard star took to his Instagram to gush about how “beautiful” Christine looked. Alongside a snap of the couple as they arrived at the ceremony, Kevin told his 828,000 followers: “How beautiful is my date? Thank you to The Academy for having us tonight.” Three days earlier, Kevin shared a throwback snap of himself holding his Oscar, reminiscing that “nothing tops” that night, adding that he was “really excited” to present an award at this year’s ceremony.
