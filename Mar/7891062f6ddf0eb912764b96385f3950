The 32-year-old marked Mother's Day by sharing an adorable picture of her baby son August on Instagram. It showed one-year-old August with Eugenie, appearing to visit the Van Gogh exhibition in London. Alongside the image the princess also paid tribute to the mothers of the world, and added: "Happy Mother's Day to every mother out there." The royal's followers were quick to praise her on the social media channel. One wrote: "Aww, this so sweet." A second posted: "Hope you’ve been spoilt rotten today Eugenie!!!!" While a third added: "Happy Mother’s Day." Eugenie has been inspired by her own mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, in her pursuits as a young mother, and other members of her family have undoubtedly also been vital for Eugenie, including Beatrice. She and her sister, Princess Beatrice, have shared a close bond throughout their lives and are regularly spotted out and about together. The pair have noted that their bond is much deeper than that shared by most siblings, particularly as they are part of the world's most recognisable family. In 2018, Eugenie admitted to Vogue that she refrained from attending parties in her younger days for a lack of confidence, watching as her sister took the lead.

She added: "We've been through some incredibly stressful times together as a family and every single minute she created joy. "I am so lucky that I get to lean on her every single day.

Beatrice also spoke of their closeness, but noted how the pair were prone to the occasional row. She recalled: “One of the biggest fights we ever had was about a pair of Converse trainers. “We have the same size feet and both of us had identical pairs. "One pair got trashed and the other sister may have swapped them.” Although trivial, it suggests just how indestructible their relationship is, with Eugenie lavishing praise on her sister for supporting her while they grew up. Eugenie told Vogue: “There was a horrible article that had been written about Beatrice and she got really upset. "We were just about to step out and she had a bit of a wobble and cried. I was looking after her. "And then about an hour later, I had a wobble and started crying and Bea was there for me.” Royal rivalries are not uncommon, and even in the upper echelons of the Firm divisions play out between siblings, perhaps most prominently in Prince Harry and Prince William. Reports of a row between the brothers began to emerge in 2019, when Harry admitted to ITV that he and William were on "different paths", a claim the Duke of Sussex would reiterate during his interview with Oprah Winfrey in March this year. His chat with CBS icon Oprah, also saw him argue that William and their father Prince Charles were "trapped" inside the Royal Family due to their status as future monarchs.
