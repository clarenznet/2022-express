Chris Cleave, 54, was driving through the resort of Playa del Carmen in his convertible red Audi when he was ambushed. Two men opened fire through the driver's side window, hitting him in the head and killing him instantly. His daughter Chloe, 14, was taken to hospital but was not seriously injured. The message, which referred to a restaurant called Bistro Playacar, was written in Spanish and removed by the police soon after it appeared on March 5. It said: "This is for you (names withheld) from Playacar, with Range Rover and Porsche cars and the secret partners of Bistro Playacar. "We are coming for you and the sale of your s***. Also for you Chris, with the red Audi. Unconfirmed local reports at the time said the mystery men behind the message wanted to sell their drugs there. Yesterday a spokesman for Quintana Roo's State Prosecution Service said: "We can confirm the arrest of two men who probably participated in the incident that took place on Saturday morning in which a foreigner living in the area lost his life." "The weapon that was used has been recovered." Pictures were released of the men, who were named only as Lenin N, 18, and Jose N, 30. Authorities said one of the alleged killers had tried to flee on foot after getting off the motorbike during a police chase and hiding in the undergrowth. Chris became a Mexican resident in 2013 and worked as an estate agent and property manager, according to police. He is believed to have been followed as he left his home before being assassinated as he stopped in traffic. Friends paid tribute on his Facebook page, with John Archer writing: "RIP this is the saddest news I have ever heard in my life."
