Sophie Turner, 26, made sure to make an entrance at Vanity Fair's annual post-Oscars party as she wore a bright red gown. The Game of Thrones actress looked radiant as she showed off her growing baby bump for the first time alongside husband Joe Jonas. The long-sleeved gown featured a large red collared neckline and long sleeves. She accessorised her dress with sparkly earrings, along with her pear shaped engagement ring. Sophie went for a subtle make-up look along with a glossy red lip and a slicked back ponytail. She posed alongside her husband Joe, who wore a black jewelled suit, with a V-neck T-shirt underneath. Rumours began to spread last month that Sophie was pregnant when she wore a figure-hugging green dress, which appeared to show the outline of a baby bump. The couple welcomed their first child, Willa, in July 2020.
