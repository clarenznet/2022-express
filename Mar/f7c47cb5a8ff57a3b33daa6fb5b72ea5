Millions of people on certain benefits could be making savings on things like NHS prescriptions.

While medication is essential for those who are ill or who have a long term condition, some groups of people could get free prescriptions for free. In total, 15 groups of people including Britons who rely on Pension Credit and Universal Credit should get them for free. Others who rely on more than one prescription per month could save money by investing in a Prepayment Certificate. READ MORE: Nationwide customers get 2.5% interest rate on savings - could you?
