Fiona Beal, 48, is charged with killing Nicholas Billingham, 42, between October 30 and November 10 last year. She was remanded in custody after a two-minute hearing at Northampton magistrates' court yesterday and will next appear at crown court on Tuesday.  Beal was arrested last Wednesday at a hotel in Cumbria, more than 200 miles from her terraced house in the Kingsley area of Northampton. Police forensic staff found the remains of Mr Billingham, believed to have been Beal's partner, after four days of digging. A cadaver dog had been deployed to the address. The remains were being taken to Leicester for examination by a Home Office pathologist. DCI Adam Pendlebury, from the Major Crime team of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, had revealed: "We believe the body to be that of a missing 42-year-old male. "Our officers have been conducting inquiries in the area over the past couple of days." Beal is said to have been working at Eastfield Academy, a primary in the town. Following her court appearance, a spokesman for the school said: "We were shocked and saddened to hear that one of our teaching staff has been charged with a very serious offence. "We are particularly mindful of the impact this news will have on the children. "We will be doing everything we can to support both pupils and staff as we work through this difficult time together."
