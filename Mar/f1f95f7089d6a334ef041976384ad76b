Figures for Tuesday, from data firm Experian Catalist, showed the average cost of a litre of petrol was £1.65. The average cost of a litre of diesel was £1.76. Petrol has risen 16p a litre and diesel 24p in the last month alone. The cost of filling up a typical family car has soared above £90. Oil prices surged significantly after the invasion of Ukraine, but have fallen in recent days, which could give hope to UK motorists. The wholesale price per barrel of Brent crude oil reached $139 on March 7, its highest in 14 years. It has since come down to around $100 (£76), after hopes for peace talks and the prospect of other oil-producing countries making up for the shortfall. There is also an expected ease in demand from China as Covid cases increase. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said drivers "badly need a break from these relentless daily rises". He added: "With the Spring Statement just a week away, drivers will be looking to the Chancellor to end their misery by cutting duty or VAT."
