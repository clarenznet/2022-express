The fundamentalist regime, which regained power last August, reneged on its pledge to allow education to continue for teenage girls. Teachers and students from three high schools around the capital Kabul said girls had returned to campuses yesterday, but were ordered home. Heather Barr, of Human Rights Watch, said: "The rug has been ripped out from under them again." In October, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Taliban would be judged "on their actions, not words". Ms Barr added: "The Taliban has put out false statements over and over in the last seven months.There's no reason to trust their word."
