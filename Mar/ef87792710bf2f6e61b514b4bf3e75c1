Phillip Carey assaulted the dementia patient, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, at a private home in Blackpool. But the woman's niece, suspicious about her aunt's behaviour, had put CCTV in and with her husband saw the carer's attack from 50 miles away. Carey, 48, was sentenced to life with a minimum 10 years at Preston Crown Court last month after admitting rape - yet the victim's relatives face a battle to keep the device in her room. The Express backs Antonia's Law, which calls for families to be allowed to install cameras. Tony Stowell called for the right to install CCTV after being heartbroken by the care of his late mother Antonia, 87. The 99-year-old's relatives said: "We're 100 per cent behind Antonia's Law. "It won't completely remove the risks because there are bathrooms where it's not possible to have CCTV. But our aunt may have been spared this horrendous ordeal if cameras had been allowed. The care home have asked us to remove the camera.We have refused." The widowed great-great aunt had been in the home just weeks when she was attacked. Family noticed she was not eating. Her niece said: "We told the manager something wasn't right. He was a bit dismissive. I wasn't prepared to leave it. So we decided to put the camera in. It looks like a digital alarm clock. We were watching it together because we'd seen something suspicious the day before. Carey had been angry and grabbed our aunt."  She added: "I thought something bad was happening but I never expected to see something this extreme." They rang police who quickly arrested Carey and obtained DNA evidence. Det Insp Chris Naidu, from Lancashire Police, said: "We commend the victim and her family for their dignity and strength throughout the investigation and court case."
