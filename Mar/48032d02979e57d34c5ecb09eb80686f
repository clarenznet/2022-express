Kate Middleton and Prince William left from Lynden Pindling International Airport in Nassau, Bahamas. The Duchess put on a final colourful display as the couple concluded the royal tour. Throughout the trip, Kate has opted for a range of colourful ensembles. At the departure parade last night, she wore a yellow floral sundress by Alessandra Rich. The designer gown is on sale for $2,033, or around £1,541. It had short puff sleeves and a fitted bodice which continued into a peplum style.

The button down gown cut off just above the ankles. It had a large bow at the front of the top. She completed the look with a pair of white closed toe high heels.  Kate has worn the shoes for many engagements over the last eight days. They are believed to be Jimmy Choo, costing around £430. The shoes matched a small £255 cream clutch bag. The design, Ferragamo Vara, has also been a staple of many outfits worn by the Duchess during her tour. To travel back to the UK, Kate opted for comfort and pulled her long dark locks into a slick high ponytail. She kept her jewellery simple, wearing only a pair of drop gold earrings. The royal had a natural make-up look with a slick of dark eyeliner and a nude lip gloss. The dress had similarities to one worn by Queen Elizabeth II, then Princess Elizabeth, in South Africa in 1947. The monarch wore a dress which also had a bold yellow pattern and a bow at the front. The gown, previously worn by the Queen, had similar puff sleeves and pulled in at the waist. Kate Middleton made another nod to the monarch earlier this week as she wore a white lace dress. This resembled an outfit worn by the Queen more than 50 years ago.
