The former Countdown star, who was once declared one of the highest-paid females in television, took to Instagram to showcase her bandage-style bodysuit, which fitted like a glove. Her voluptuous figure dazzled in the black and white optical illusion number, which accentuated her curvy hips and slim waistline. She modelled the outfit, which featured a zip up the front and a mesh section above the bust, at Cardiff's luxury hotel The Park Gate. She shouted out the venue in her Instagram Stories, praising their "seriously good food". She was there for a "pre-game production meeting" in the lead up to the Six Nations Rugby game, during which she will enthusiastically be cheering on Wales. Later on, she opted for a casual tracksuit as she filmed the development of her motor home. The van is currently being fitted with a compost toilet - but fans can no doubt expect to see another one of her glamorous looks soon.
