A new world trade monitor published by the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis demonstrated Britain's post-pandemic global trade has not recovered as well as its rivals. The report added the UK had “missed out” on much of the recovery trade and suggested that “Brexit may have been a factor”. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee said Brexit had “reduced the economy’s openness, in trade and labour mobility”.  Last week the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said global trade in the British Isles “lagged behind” domestic recovery. The OBR added as the UK has become less trade intensive, the country’s productivity would be reduced by four percent over the next 15 years. So, do you believe Brexit has played a primary role in hindering Britain's trade recovery post-Covid? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
