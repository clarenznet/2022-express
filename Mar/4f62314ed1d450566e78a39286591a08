The biggest spiders in Britain are now thriving in the UK's wetlands, according to RSPB research. The hand-sized arachnids are called fen raft spiders. They can walk on water and despite their numbers dwindling dangerously close to extinction a decade ago, they now have a healthy population size.  The fen raft is the biggest of the 660 species of spider in Britain. It is unlikely to be found in homes and does not pose any threat to humans. An RSPB report was released this week stating numbers of the semi-aquatic fen raft are now into the thousands. The fen raft has an impressive leg span of three inches.

Speaking to the Daily Star, the RSPB's Tim Strudwick said: "This is one of the UK’s rarest invertebrates, as beautiful as any. "We are really proud of the part our reserve and team has played in its recovery. "The females are impressive in size, but elegant and quite beautiful, even to an arachnophobe, like me." The best place to see a fen raft spider is in wetland areas. DON'T MISS:Pensioners choice of heating or testing!

Mr Strudwick went on to say: "The spiders are only seen in the grazing marsh ditches. "They are fairly shy. "They are easy to find from June to September when the mature females have their young." The fen raft is a protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This is due to its high risk of extinction. The fen raft was helped back from extinction by a pioneering translocation project between conservation partners and funders. This included the RSPB, as well as the British Arachnological Society, Suffolk and Sussex Wildlife Trusts, Natural England, and the Broads Authority.
