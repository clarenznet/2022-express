Former EastEnders actress Jessica Plummer opted to forgo her underwear last night as she made an appearance at Dunhill's pre-BAFTA party in London. The star, 29, put on a jaw-dropping display in a racy dress which flashed her entire leg, thigh, and part of her behind as she posed for snaps. Attending the star-studded event yesterday, the star, who played Chantelle Atkins in EastEnders for a year, wowed in the strapless black dress. Posing for photos, Jessica gave the camera a sultry pout while putting her incredible figure on display. Despite the gown skimming the tops of her heels, Jessica left little to the imagination thanks to the lace-up design of the dress. The star managed to protect her modesty by placing a hand over her hip as she flashed plenty of skin through the criss-cross design.
