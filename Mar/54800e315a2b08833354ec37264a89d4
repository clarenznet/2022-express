The aircraft took off from RAF Brize Norton at 4.17pm today. Flight trackers show it made a series of circles around Cheltenham.  During the two hours it was in the air, the Atlas C1 sent out a 7700 signal, which are used to alert air traffic control to an emergency on board. A 7700 code usually means an engineering issue with the aircraft. It comes just two days after an RAF Typhoon fighter jet was forced to perform a U-turn and return to base after admitting a "squawk". A spokesperson for RAF Coningsby said that the pilot had reported fumes in the cockpit, and had landed safely.  RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, is the largest Royal Air Force base in the country. Atlas C1 carriers are able to carry a 37-ton payload over 2,000 nautical miles, and is capable of reaching altitudes of 40,000 feet. The aircraft are able to accomodate 116 fully-equipped soldiers, as well as a Chinook helicopter or nine pallets and 54 passengers.  A Royal Navy spokesperson said: "Today a wildcat helicopter was conducting a routine sortie over the Somerset levels by a qualified test pilot. "During this pre-planned flight, a routine test of the transponder was conducted." Express.co.uk understands that the wildcat flight involved no emergency and no one was in any danger.
