The royal couple fed the animals and met an adoring public on a trip to promote the importance of the rural economy to the Principality.  Kate, 40, wore a Â£940 forest green Sportmax coat with a matching polo neck jumper and black jeans for the jaunt to the countryside. William, 39, chose a navy coat and green jumper and, like his wife, wore a daffodil in his buttonhole to celebrate Wales' patron saint, whose feast day they marked in Welsh, tweeting: "Dydd Gwyl Dewi Hapus." They visited Abergavenny market before donning khaki wax jackets for feeding duties at nearby Pant Farm. The goats' milk from there has been used by a local cheese producer for nearly 20 years. The duke and duchess then met members of Blaenavon Hwb, a youth centre helping over 600 youngsters.
