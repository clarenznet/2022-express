The former This Morning star, 64, and TV chef Phil separated in January 2020, after 20 years of marriage. Fern told Woman & Home: "People say they bounce back from a long relationship, but it takes a while. "The rebound is difficult. You chuck the pebble in the pond but the ripples go on for a very long time. It's been a long time getting to the dawn but I'm in another brand-new chapter and do feel it will be all right." Fern, who is on the cover of May's issue, also said of being in her 60s: "When you get to 40, you think, 'I'm not going to take any more s*** from anybody.' When you get to 50, you start saying 'F*** off!' to everybody. When you're 60, you think, 'Do you know what? I can't be a**ed. I'm allowed to say it." *Read the full interview in the May issue of Woman & Home, out on April 7.
