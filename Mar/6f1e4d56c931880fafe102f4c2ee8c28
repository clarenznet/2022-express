Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale stunned Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers for the second time this season after denying Harvey Barnes in the first half of the clubs’ Premier League clash. Barnes’ header was goal-bound but Ramsdale reached across to tip the ball wide.  The Gunners shot-stopper has been excellent since completing a summer move from Sheffield United. However, the visitors threatened an equaliser and won a couple of set pieces late in the first half. Broadcast cameras showed the Northern Irishman turning away and exclaiming “Wow”.  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta was so certain the attacking midfielder had scored that he revealed he muttered ‘goal’ before seeing his goalkeeper keep out the effort. “I have just seen a picture,” the Spaniard said after that game in October. I haven't seen the video footage but my reaction there when I saw the ball leaving Maddison's foot, I said, 'Goal'. “So I don't know how it happened, it was incredible - and the moment and the timing of it  as well was crucial.”
