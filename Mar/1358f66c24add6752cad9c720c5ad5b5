In an online statement, Jamie Wallis, 37, said he had had gender dysphoria - feelings of a mismatch between his biological sex and gen- der identity - since he was a "very young child". The Bridgend MP also said he was raped last year by a man he met online. In addition, someone outed him to his family and tried to blackmail him for Â£50,000. Mr Wallis said the offender was jailed for two years and nine months. The MP said: "I'm trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be. "I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. "Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. Well, I'm not." Mr Wallis said of his rape ordeal: "I have not been myself since this incident and I don't think I will ever recover. "It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from." At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Boris Johnson told Mr Wallis: "Sharing this very intimate story would have taken an immense amount of courage. "I know the House stands with you and we'll give you the support that you need to live freely as yourself."
