Emma Raducanu has insisted she can handle her recent “bad luck” after all her “good fortune” last year. The US Open champion faces a late fitness test on her left leg injury before her opening match at the Indian Wells Masters. The British No.1 caught Covid before Christmas, suffered from a blister at the Australian Open and had to pull out of her event in Mexico because of her latest injury setback. Raducanu said: "It's all part of it, all these spanners in the works. "I feel like I can take whatever bad luck is thrown at me after all the good fortune I had last year."  The Bromley local has been filming some promotional videos for the tournament and indicated that she wanted none other than Andy Murray in her coaching corner one day. "Also Andy because he's really good at breaking down the game," she said in a behind-the-scenes clip posted by the BNP Paribas Open. "I feel like his insight and knowledge would be really helpful and I'd love to hear it." The world No 13, who lost in the Californian desert in the first round in her first match as a Major champion last October, is due to face Caroline Garcia of France. Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus is top seed in the absence of Ash Barty and Barbora Krejcikova. "I feel really sad and really bad about Ukrainian citizens who lost their homes in the war," she said. "But unfortunately it's not under my control. I just hope for peace.” Wildcard Andy Murray has been drawn to face Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel for the third time this year after a win each in Melbourne and Doha.
