  Loose Women star Ruth Langsford revealed that she feels like she is constantly “spinning plates”. Describing herself as part of the “sandwich generation”, the ITV presenter opened up about having children “later in life”.      Ruth, 62, spoke about the challenges that women of her age often face in a candid interview. She said: “Women particularly - and I’m not saying men don’t spin plates, because I’m not anti-men at all! - I think women spin a lot of plates. “My friends, and myself particularly, they call us the sandwich generation. “I had children later in life and I’m still responsible for children,” she explained.

Feeling Fabulous will be taking over London’s Old Billingsgate on Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th July 2022, featuring two days packed full of fashion edits, expert-led stage talks, beauty demonstrations, retail therapy and a few glasses of fizz.       In light of her earlier comments, Ruth described the event as a day out for people to “make time for themselves” and to get “away from stresses and strains of everyday life”. Ruth is married to fellow presenter Eamonn Holmes, 62, with whom she shares one child. The couple married in 2010, but previously met back in 1997 through a mutual friend. Ruth and Eamonn share one son, Jack Alexander, who was born in 2002. READ MORE...
