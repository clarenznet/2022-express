Gordon Ramsay, 55, beamed as he posed with her daughter at the launch party for his new BBC show Gordon's Future Food Stars. Holly Ramsay, 22, looked radiant in a skintight purple bodysuit, paired with black fitted mom jeans. She teamed the outfit with black boots, a gold necklace, along with a gold bracelet and watch. She wore her blonde tresses in a loose wave and minimal makeup. Gordon looked happy next to his daughter as he wore all black, not taking attention away from Holly. The chef sported a black shirt, bomber jacket, trainers and black jeans. The family posed along with Angellica Bell who looked chic in a black and white patterned dress. This comes after Holly took to Instagram on International Women's Day to post a topless picture of herself along with a string of women important to her. Gordon took to the comments of the post to tell his daughter how "proud" he is of her, after she overcame some difficult health woes. Holly has been sober for over a year since bravely opening up about her sexual assault at the age of 18.
