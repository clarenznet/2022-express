Ukraine's state emergency service estimates more than 2,000 ordinary citizens have died since February 24. Mr Johnson told the Commons: "What we have seen already from Vladimir Putin's regime - in the use of the munitions that they have already been dropping on innocent civilians - in my view, already fully qualifies as a war crime." Downing Street noted that possible war crimes were occurring "almost hourly", such as Russia's attack on the Kyiv Holocaust memorial at Babi Yar and the targeting of apartment blocks. A spokesman said: "Formally it will be for a criminal court to make that ruling but I think no one can be in any doubt that what we're seeing daily, almost hourly now, are horrific acts that would certainly appear to be war crimes." Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said yesterday: "Putin is a war criminal and one day he must face justice in The Hague." The International Criminal Court is planning to open a probe into the invasion. Mr Johnson's war crimes claim is backed up by the UN's official definition. The UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect has stated: "The concept of war crimes developed…at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, when international humanitarian law, also known as the law of armed conflict, was codified. "The Hague Conventions adopted in 1899 and 1907 focus on the prohibition to warring parties to use certain means and methods of warfare." Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was found guilty of genocide in 2016 and jailed for life over his actions in the former Yugoslavia. Yesterday Prime Minister's Questions began with a standing ovation in honour of Ukraine's ambassador Vadym Prystaiko - before Mr Johnson urged the Russian president to "turn his tanks around" or face further economic pressure and more weapons supplies to Ukraine. He told MPs: "Putin has gravely miscalculated. "In his abhorrent assault on a sovereign nation, he has underestimated the extraordinary fortitude of the Ukrainian people and the unity and resolve of the free world in standing up to his barbarism." The PM warned he will clobber Putin's cronies with more sanctions, but asked if he will target billionaire Roman Abramovich he said it was "not appropriate" to discuss individual cases. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has insisted Russia must stop attacking his cities before talks can happen between the countries, saying: "It's necessary to at least stop bombing people [first]." Zelensky said Ukraine will want legally binding security guarantees if Nato decides to block its membership. Mr Johnson spoke to President Zelensky again yesterday, with Downing Street saying the men "agreed on the need for sanctions to go further to exert maximum pressure" in the coming days. The Government is to match the first £20million donated to an appeal launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee for Ukraine.
