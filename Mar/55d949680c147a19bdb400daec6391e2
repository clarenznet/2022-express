The claims were made by Larysa Gerasko, the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, at a parliamentary committee meeting last week. However the Irish budget airline has hit back with chief executive Michael O’Leary slamming the claims as "completely false".  He said: "We already carry thousands of refugees around Europe with fixed fares of €20 [£16.70] and €30 and €50. "This story that we are hiking the fares out of Poland is completely false." Mr O’Leary went on to point out that the Ryanair business model allowed cheap fares but that tickets could be more expensive on popular flights. He said: "If a flight fills, the last few fares will be sold at the highest fares."  Irish Transport minister Eamon Ryan is duty bound to investigate the matter and told RTE Radio that he would speak to the Ambassador and Ryanair. He said: "We’re in constant touch with Ryanair. "Through the previous Covid crisis, on a number of occasions, they helped us in terms of getting people out of difficult places in different ways. "Let me first of all talk to the ambassador and then I’ll talk to Ryanair without a doubt."
