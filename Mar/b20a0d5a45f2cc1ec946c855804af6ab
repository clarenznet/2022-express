National Highways: West Midlands tweeted to confirm the M6 closures earlier today. They warned from 9pm on Wednesday, March 16 to 6am on Thursday, March 17 the M6 would be closed both north and southbound. This could cause traffic chaos for commuters, with some routes closed as early as 7.45pm tonight. Due to the closures, drivers will be diverted away from the motorway and instead directed to join the M6 over the roundabout. Drivers will need to leave the M6 at junction 34 and head along the southbound A589 Caton Road towards Lancaster city centre. They will then join the A6 in Lancaster city centre before heading back onto the M6 at junction 33 at Galgate. The closures are due to the work to transform the Walsall junction. The Â£78 million project will see the Walsall junction replace a series of bridges along the M6. For the full details on the closures, scroll down.
