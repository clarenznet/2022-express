Amanda showcased the two-piece set from Pretty Lavish to her 1.8 million followers this morning. This saw her pairing a mint green jumper with a knitted skirt in the same shade. The top featured a cut-out element over the chest while the skirt has a thigh-high split to show off her toned legs. Amanda appeared to forgo a bra in the stunning ensemble which clung to her curves. The Britainâ€™s Got Talent star wore her light brown hair straight to compliment her cosy look. She paired the look with heels in the same shade, which she showed off in a catwalk video. In another video, Amanda could be seen cheekily dancing behind one of her co-stars in the Global office. The star hosts the Heart Breakfast show with Jamie Theakston every weekday from 6.30am until 10am.
