Ukrainian MP Inna Sovusan says Vladimir Putin's forces are taking civilians from Mariupol, the port city where some 400,000 people are trapped due to constant bombardments, to camps where they are forced to sign in papers in which they agree to work, with no pay, in "distant parts" of the country. This, Ms Sovusan says, is what "completely totalitarian states" do. She tells Times Radio: "The very logic of Russia right now is the logic of the Soviet Union and the logic of the Nazi Germany." When asked whether where Ukrainians are being taken are "labour camps", she replies: "Exactly." According to the MP, this was confirmed by Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, and by the council.
