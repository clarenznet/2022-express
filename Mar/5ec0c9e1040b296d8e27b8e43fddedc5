Demi Rose looked phenomenal in a series of red carpet photographs from days gone by. However, the 26-year-old model risked a wardrobe malfunction due to her dress’ unique cleavage. The stunning social media star had worn a black midi dress to Sixty6 Magazine’s issue four launch party at Sanctum Soho Hotel. The show-stopping dress featured a sultry slit and a unique cleavage boasting a metal ring in the centre. Demi paired the gown with matching heeled sandals. The model opted for a classic contour and berry lip, with a dramatic pair of fake lashes for the glitzy event. She wore her long tresses down, parted to one side and styled with a wet look styling gel.
