The Russian president, speaking in a televised address from the Kremlin nearly three weeks into Moscow's invasion, warned: "I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera. Or who can't get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called 'gender freedoms'. "The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia. "The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors? to divide our society? to provoke civil confrontation? to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia." And he claimed the conflict was merely a pretext for theWest to impose sanctions, warning that the West's "attempt to have global dominance" is coming to an end. Speaking in a televised government meeting in Moscow he said the West is trying to "cancel Russia" with an "economic blitzkrieg" of sanctions.
