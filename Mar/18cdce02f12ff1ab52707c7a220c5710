He told them the Government wanted to “rapidly accelerate nuclear projects” to be clean, reliable and safe energy sources. Yesterday’s talks came as there were reports of tensions between No 10 and the Treasury about the cost of an investment drive. A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister made clear his vision for nuclear to be a major part of the UK’s future energy system. The spokesman added: “He set out this Government’s commitment to supporting the industry to develop a thriving pipeline of projects in a cost-effective way.” Figures from the sector set out details of a series of plans for both large-scale and smaller plants. The No 10 spokesman added: “They discussed the benefits of scaling up investment and removing barriers facing development, agreeing to work together to help projects become operational more quickly and cheaply.” Ahead of the publication of the Government’s energy security strategy next week, the PM also inspected a model of Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactor design with CEO Tom Samson, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Helen Whately.
