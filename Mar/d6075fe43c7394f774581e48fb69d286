This marks the first time that China acknowledges the war Russia has declared against Ukraine, with its troops raiding the Eastern European country for 15 days now. Mr Yi’s statements signify a cooling in the relationship between China and Russia, and a shift in attitude since the country’s government has so far avoided the use of the word “war”. The statement, reported by state media, was made during a call of Mr Yi with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian. At the same time, China is trying to protect its economy from sanctions imposed against Russia. The country has been easing government exchange rate controls to allow the Russian rouble to fall faster in value against the yuan, the Times reported. Hit by economic sanctions, Russia’s aviation sector is struggling to fulfil its necessary demand in parts, with Boeing and Airbus having halted their supply. The Interfax news agency reported that China had refused to supply Russian airlines with parts. Russian officials said that the country would seek to source components from other countries, such as Turkey and India. China abstained from the vote during last week’s emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During this vote, 141 out of the 193 member states of the UN agreed to condemn the war and called on Putin to withdraw all its troops from Ukraine. On a visit to Washington, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss praised the 141 countries and the UN vote. She said that more countries should be “drawn into the orbit of those who are prepared to stand up for sovereignty”. The Foreign Secretary expressed her will that China would follow through, and noted: “China looms large over this debate." She added: “Beijing is increasing its assertiveness and expanding its armed forces at breakneck speed.”
