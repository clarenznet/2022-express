Harry Bradley disappeared from the village of Paderne near the holiday resort of Albufeira on March 17, prompting searches to begin. On Friday police confirmed they had found his body in the well in the town of Sao Bartolomeu de Messines. The discovery was made just before 8am local time. Officers said his locked and parked Berlingo van had been discovered nearby on waste ground yesterday. They had been focusing the search, which involved sniffer dogs, on the area after detecting a signal from his mobile phone. The 22-year-old is believed to have been living in the village where he was last seen after going out for a walk with his pet dog Nim. The cause of Harry’s death was not immediately clear. The Mirror quoted well-placed sources who said there was no evidence pointing to a crime. An autopsy will now take place although the results are not expected to be publicly released. Harry's parents, Angela and Mark, had approached newspapers in the area asking for help to spread the word about his disappearance. They told the Portugal Resident that he “likes to walk in the countryside in places like the Barragem do Arade, in Messines”. Harry “was not in a good place” when he went for his walk, his mum said, before suggesting that he loved his dog and wouldn't do anything to endanger her. Mark had hired a helicopter to search for Harry from the air, but with no luck. The family moved out to Portugal in 2017, with Harry arriving a year later. Additional reporting by Gerard Couzens
