A no-fly zone would help protect Ukraine from Russian missiles and bombing but would also mean that Western troops would have to take an active role in the conflict. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request: “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that [establish a no-fly zone] we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries. “At the same time, we have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering. “So that's the reason why we make this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support, stepping up support. “But at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in their airspace.” Ukraine is not yet a NATO country but wants to join NATO and the European Union, which Russian President Vladimir Putin views as a threat. It is NATO’s “aggression” and “eastward expansion” that Putin has claimed is the reason for his invasion. During a press conference yesterday, Putin said: "Now we are hearing that a no-fly zone must be established over the territory of Ukraine. "It is impossible to do over the territory of Ukraine, it is only possible from the territory of some neighbouring countries. "But any move in this direction will be seen by us as a participation in the armed conflict or whichever side whose territory will pose a threat to our service members. "That very second we will view them as participants of the military conflict and would not matter what members they are." So what do YOU think? Should NATO enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine?
