BBC Weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood predicted intense gusty winds this weekend across parts of the UK. Ms Kirkwood also predicted heavy showers and temperatures in the North of up to nine in the North and thirteen in the South. Patches of sunshine in between showers of rain can also be expected but the Met Office has issued one red weather warning alert for flooding in the UK on the North sea coast of Bridlington.   Ms Kirkwood said: "To start with, it's a mild start to the day more or less across the board. "So bear that in mind if you are stepping out, but it's not necessarily dry because this big area of cloud is a weather front that's already producing some rain. "And you can see this area of cloud across Scotland that's also producing some light rain and some drizzle. "Not just in the North of Scotland, but also in parts of Northern England that will tend to fizzle.

"Especially in the North, it's going to be a windy day generally where ever you are. "So we're starting off with some dry weather, some sunshine. "But as this weather front comes in from the South-West, it's going to introduce more rain falling Northwards towards the course of the day.

Ms Kirkwood said: "Behind it will be a plethora of showers, a lot of clouds around and gales across the Northern Isles. "Breeze particularly in the South, particularly along the South coast. "We can see some fog patches form in Northern Ireland but it's once again not going to be a particularly cold night. "Tomorrow we start off with extensive cloud also all these showers, but there will be some brightness coming through and some sunshine developing."
