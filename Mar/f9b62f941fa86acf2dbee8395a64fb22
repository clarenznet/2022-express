Lewis Hamilton has suggested that he may not extend his current deal at Mercedes by insisting that he does not want to be in Formula One at the age of 40. The Brit is tied down to the Silver Arrows until the end of next season as things stand after penning a new two-year contract back in July. The deal is said to be worth an estimated £40million per year, a figure that puts him level with Max Verstappen as the sport's joint-highest earner.However, there are said to be growing questions over Hamilton's long-term future on the grid after the seven-time Drivers' Championship winner celebrated his 37th birthday at the start of the new year.He was initially rumoured to be considering the idea of walking away from the sport in the wake of his crushing defeat at last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.The man from Stevenage went on to end the speculation over his continued presence on the grid by returning ahead of last month's three-day shakedown in Barcelona, but it seems as though the end of his F1 career may still be around the corner.He admitted on Saturday that he is not planning on staying in the paddock into his 40s, a revelation which suggests that his current deal with Mercedes could potentially be his last. JUST IN: Max Verstappen casts doubt on Lewis Hamilton winning eighth F1 title "I haven’t thought about that number, because I’m 37," said Hamilton after the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain."I’ve still got a bit to go, so I honestly haven’t thought about that and I don’t plan on being here close to that age."A number of other drivers have stayed in F1 past the age of 40 in recent years, including the likes of Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen.The former is still on the grid and will be looking to lead a strong campaign with Alpine over the coming months, while the latter decided to call it quits at the end of last season. Hamilton has been stepping up his off-track commitments over the last few years, though, and could be tempted to switch his full attention to his other ventures in the near future."Hopefully I’ll have some other something to get on with," he added.He recently admitted that he did consider the prospect of retiring from F1 during the recent winter break but insisted that he had no regrets over his eventual decision to return."It was obviously a difficult time for me to be honest, I just unplugged, I switched off," Hamilton told reporters last month.
