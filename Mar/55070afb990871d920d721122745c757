If you've been an Xbox fan ever since Microsoft first entered the console arena back in 2001 you'll want to double check if you've amassed some rare and valuable retro games in your collection. Research from retro gaming website PriceCharting has revealed the rare and valuable original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games that sell for the most amount of money on the collector's market. A number of Xbox games released in the UK are now worth hundreds of pounds - while one Xbox 360 game that was released in the US is now worth over £6,000. In terms of the original Xbox, the two most valuable games released in the UK are racer Room Zoom and Xiaolin Showdown. A brand new copy of Room Zoom fetches over £600 while Xiaolin Showdown has been known to sell for in excess of £920. Other rare and valuable Xbox games include OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast and Capcom's cult classic mech game Steel Battalion, which was sold with a huge controller that looks like it's been taken straight from inside a mech bundled in. Speaking about why Steel Battalion is so desired in a blog post, PriceCharting previously said: "Steel Battalion is a Mech game that was sold with a large specialty controller. The controller tried to replicate being inside a Mech and had nearly 40 buttons. Because the controller was so large the game retailed for $200 and only limited quantities were produced. The initial production was close to 2,000 units but the game was re-released, adding a few more copies to the market." In terms of Xbox 360 releases, for the UK market the most valuable games are Halo 3 (Legendary Edition) and Fallout New Vegas (Collector's Edition) - with new versions of these worth £265 and £191 respectively. However, if you like to import games you may have one game lying around which is worth big bucks.  That title is the US version of Dead Space (Ultra Limited Edition) for the Xbox 360. A complete in box version of this is worth over £5,900 - while a new version is worth over £6,000. Speaking about why this edition is so valuable, PriceCharting in a previous blog post said: "When the original Dead Space launched is 2008, EA made 1,000 Ultra Limited Edition copies they sold for $149 each. This special edition includes the game itself, special packaging, "Downfall" animated DVD, lithograph, artbook, graphic novel, and Ishimura patch. "The price is much higher than other limited editions because EA made such a small quantity and has never re-printed them." In terms of the Xbox One, the most valuable games released in the UK are the collector's editions of Titanfall 2, Doom Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077. You can find more details on the most valuable Xbox games below. And if you're new to retro gaming there's a few important things to point out before we go through the prices. The main thing to bear in mind if you're just getting into retro game collecting is prices vary on a number of factors - namely the region a game is released in, the version of said game (if it was released on multiple formats) as well as if the game is loose, complete in box (CIB - which it means it comes with a box, disc or cart and manual if one is available as well as inserts) or brand new. Prices listed below are for Xbox games released in the UK PAL region. If you're based outside of the UK, the value for these games will vary depending on if you have a copy released for America or Japan.
