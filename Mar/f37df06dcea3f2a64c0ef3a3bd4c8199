On Saturday, the Duke and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge embarked on an eight-day royal tour to Belize, Jamaica, and the Bahamas to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Their trip across the Commonwealth nations is seen as an attempt to drum up support for the monarchy and persuade other countries not to follow Barbados by choosing to become a republic. The tour is one of four being carried out by senior royals to commemorate the Jubilee. The Queen has taken a step back in recent months due to health concerns — and in this time, we have seen William take on more responsibilities.With his grandmother being Britain’s longest reigning monarch and his father being the longest reigning Prince of Wales, William has had plenty of time to prepare for his time on the throne.As the first child of the heir to the throne, the Duke of Cambridge secured his place in the line of succession on the day he was born. With his future role already decided, training to become King began in William’s childhood — under the expert guidance of his grandmother, the Queen. The Duke was educated in the basics of kingly duties throughout his childhood and into his teenage years.It was during this time that William reportedly felt the pressure of being a King-in-waiting.Royal author, and former correspondent for the BBC, Jennie Bond told OK! Magazine in January that the Duke showed “reluctance” to the concept of taking the throne.She said: "Having known his mother Diana and speaking to her at length about her children, I remember so vividly how she said the country is lucky to have William, he's all right. "She also said that he found at that age, in his early teens, the burden of kingship was already weighing quite heavily on his shoulders."I think we did see a reluctance to take on the role earlier on, in his early adolescence, he knew his destiny as none of the rest of us do from such an early age."In his twenties, William entered more rigorous training for the kingship.In 2009, he reportedly underwent an "intensive" two-year training program designed by the Queen and Prince Charles, according to The Daily Mail.

In the last 11 years, the Duke has dedicated his life to the Royal Family, with his wife by his side.In 2011, he married long-term girlfriend Kate Middleton in a huge wedding at Westminster Abbey.The couple spent two years in Anglesey, Wales, while William worked as a Royal Air Force search-and-rescue pilot, before moving to Kensington Palace.Since then, Kate and William have become integral members of the Firm particularly following the departures of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Andrew and Prince Philip — and the recent ill health of the Queen. Their current tour comes at a critical time for the Royal Family’s relationship with the Commonwealth, as several nations are considering severing ties with the monarchy.In November, nearly 400 years after the country became a British colony, Barbados formally removed the Queen as its Head of State.While republican sentiment has long lingered in the Commonwealth’s Caribbean realms, it has gained momentum amid worldwide protests against racism and police brutality and been spurred on further by Barbados’ recent departure.Kate and William’s trip has been criticised as a “charm offensive” as they attempt to strengthen British bonds with the Commonwealth nations. The couple are currently in Jamaica, on the second leg of their Caribbean tour. Upon their arrival, they were met with protests, calling for reparations from the British monarchy, in Kingston, Jamaica's capital city.William and Kate’s trip is sure to bring much-needed positive publicity to the Royal Family in the Caribbean country.Their visit may play a role in determining whether or not they will reign as King and Queen of Jamaica.
