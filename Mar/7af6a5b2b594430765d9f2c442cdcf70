Nervous patient Lindsey Harris went to see Sumit Aggarwal with a chipped tooth but ended up having three taken out and was left having to wear a denture. She sued Mr Aggarwal and the north Norfolk dental practice where he worked, claiming he negligently "smashed" one of her teeth "to pieces", causing damage to two others which he then needlessly pulled out.  Mrs Harris, 56, a restaurant chef and manager, told Central London County court that she never properly consented to having any teeth out and was "left in agony" by her "horrendous" experience. She added: "There was an awful lot of blood". Judge Christopher Letham found the dentist and Compass Clinic Ltd liable for the negligent treatment in June 2014 and ordered them to pay £137,000 in costs and damages.   In the witness box, Mrs Harris said she initially sought help for a chipped tooth and was surprised on being told it would have to be removed. The court heard Mr Aggarwal was an agency worker at Compass Clinic, covering annual leave. Mrs Harris said: "He said he was the expert and I shouldn't argue." Things got worse for the seafood chef from Wells next-the-Sea, Norfolk, after she returned to have the extraction performed and damage caused by Mr Aggarwal led to two more teeth coming out. She said she was so nervous a dental nurse was "holding my hand".   Mrs Harris's fears were realised when a 12-minute appointment became a 90-minute nightmare. She recalled: "He was very flustered after he smashed the first one to pieces." Defending the claim, Steve Plant, a director of Compass Clinic, told the judge: "Dentistry isn't engineering. Things can go wrong." Mr Plant said the costs would force the dental business to close, while Mr Aggarwal revealed that he has stopped working as a dentist.
