The 52 children, from Dnipro orphanages, landed at London's Heathrow last night. Edinburgh-based charity Dnipro Kids - set up by fans of Hibs FC - enabled the escape from Ukraine and the group were last night set to go directly to Callander in Perthshire, Scotland. They will stay in a hostel to adjust to UK life before being housed in Edinburgh with their legal guardians, in family-style groups. The flight was donated by Virgin Atlantic to take them from Warsaw and the fuel was donated by Esso.
