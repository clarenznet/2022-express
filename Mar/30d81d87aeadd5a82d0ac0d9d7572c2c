The plane from Manchester Airport to Fuerteventura, Spain, left at 8.40 this morning. It has issued a 7700 squawk alert, indicating a "general emergency". After doing circles in the air, it appears to be heading back to Manchester. A spokesperson for TUI told Express.co.uk: "Flight TOM2384 from Manchester to Fuerteventura conducted a precautionary return landing after experiencing a technical issue this morning. "The safety of our passengers and crew is our number one priority and everyone was safely disembarked. A new aircraft has been sourced and customers will be on their way to Fuerteventura soon. "We would like to apologise to those customers affected and thank them for their patience and understanding." TUI is a British-German travel company, with its headquarters in Germany. Today’s aborted flight to Fuerteventura comes the day after International Women’s Day, during which the company tweeted that they wanted to help break bias and inequality. However, TUI has been criticised in the past for their attitudes towards women. A study in 2018 found that TUI had the largest gender pay gap by a major UK company, with its male employees paid more than twice its female employees. TUI stated in its gender pay gap report that year: “We know that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue, rather a lack of representation in specific roles.” READ MORE: Poignant pictures show US bombers at UK airbase amid World War 3 fears [INSIGHT] The company came under further controversy in August that year, when some passengers claimed that children were being given sexist stickers. For instance, boys were allegedly given “future pilot” stickers, while girls were given “ future cabin crew” ones. TUI stated: “We’re sorry to hear a small number of customers have been upset by this. “We think it has just been a simple mix-up since our future pilot and cabin crew stickers are designed for use for any child regardless of gender.”
