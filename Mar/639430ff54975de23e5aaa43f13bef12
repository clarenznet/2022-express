Families reeling from draconian restrictions have mounted a new push for legal rights. Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: "Over the past two years we've seen the devastating impact of people being isolated in health and care settings." "We must recognise in law the crucial role family carers play in the lives of people in vulnerable situations." The call for new rights has been sent to Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid ahead of a Parliamentary debate on Wednesday. It would give people the right to a "care supporter" - a relative or friend who can help them wherever needed, in hospitals, care homes or GP surgeries. Those affected by separation will talk to MPs. But neither Mr Javid nor Care Minister Gillian Keegan has said they will meet families in Westminster.
