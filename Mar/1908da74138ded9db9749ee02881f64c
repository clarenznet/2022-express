The Netflix comedy became a lockdown hit with its portrayal of naive American Emily Cooper in the chic French capital. But although Emily, played by Phil Collins' daughter Lily, 33, tackles a language barrier and love trouble, her ability to afford her lifestyle is never questioned. However, research by shoe retailer Dune London has found that in reality Emily, who works in PR for high-end French brands, would be racking up a debt of around £9,750 every month. After calculating each item of clothing she wears in the show's two seasons, set in one year, her wardrobe is worth £115,000, or a spend of £9,600 a month.The most expensive items include a Chanel bag (£7,992) and a Valentine mini dress (£6,808). Based on the character's lifestyle it is thought rent, bills, food and two nights out a week would cost another £2,400, bringing her total outgoings to £12,000 a month. However, the average salary for a marketing executive in Paris is £39,000, which means after tax, her monthly income will be around £2,250, leaving her short by £9,750 each month. The new season of Emily in Paris topped Netflix's global top 10 and the first season was the most viewed comedy of 2020.
