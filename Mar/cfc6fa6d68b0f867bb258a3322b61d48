The European Union is going to instruct the SWIFT financial networkÂ to cut off seven Russian banks, in a move to pile on economic pressure to the Russian government. However one of Russia's largest banks, Sberbank, will stay on the books. Many countries, including the Baltic states, are pushing for the EU to delist more banks as they believe the measures are not stringent enough. The formal decision will be taken on Tuesday afternoon by EU ambassadors and voted on by SWIFT's board.
