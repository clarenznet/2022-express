You would be forgiven for having a similar reaction to Denise Nolan’s debut album. What, another one? Dublin-born Denise, the second eldest of the singing sisters, quit the act 43 years ago.  Now in her sixtieth year in showbusiness, even she isn’t sure why it has taken her so long to drag herself into the recording studio. For fans for classy cabaret, though, it’s very much worth the wait. Denise adds her silvery tones to standards such as Every Time We Say Goodbye, My Funny Valentine and In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning. These twelve tracks are her take on the Great American Songbook, and her song choices, like her vocals, are impeccable. It’s a labour of love, inspired by her memories of supporting Frank Sinatra with the Nolan Sisters on his 1975 European tour.  Old Blue Eyes famously greeted them, in a cod-Irish accent, saying “Oh, I’ve got me daughters here”. Sinatra originally performed the opening track, You, My Love, with Doris Day in the 1954-shot Hollywood musical, Young At Heart. Denise’s version is spine-tingling. She had sung all of her chosen songs over decades of solo performances, “proving her poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood” – a quote from her tantalising take on Nina Simone’s I Got It Bad (And That Ain’t Good). The Nolans talked Denise into the album when, by chance, they all ended up performing together on a cruise ship during the pandemic. Fans are already lapping it up. The first single shot straight to Number 2 in the i-Tunes chart. Proving it’s never too late to make a come-back.
