Oak National Academy provides free online lessons and homework help for English speaking schoolchildren to support them with their education. And now the school has rolled out an auto-translate function, meaning those arriving in the UK can continue learning and getting extra-curricular support. The online lessons will be made available to 100,000 refugee pupils as they transition to life in the UK, according to the UK’s Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi. Pupils will be able to access quizzes and video lessons, with the auto-translate function providing them with subtitles and worksheets in either Ukrainian or Russian. Mr Zahawi said: “This will allow Ukrainian children arriving in the UK to access education in their native language as they transition into life and safety in the UK. “We will continue to support Ukrainians in any way we can. I know schools are doing what they can to support their students make sense of what they are seeing. “And we are working with schools to ensure that the tens of thousands of Ukrainian children we will welcome to our shores will have a place in our education system." The online lessons are free to access, but are not meant to be used to replace the Ukrainian curriculum or to replace a formal education. Instead, the classes are aimed at supporting students’ learning, ensuring they understand a topic by providing lessons in their own language. Matt Hood, principal of Oak National Academy, said: “It is tragic that the lives of so many children have been blighted by this horrific invasion. He added the new option to access lessons in Ukrainian "pales in comparison to the international effort needed to ensure the safety of families fleeing violence."
