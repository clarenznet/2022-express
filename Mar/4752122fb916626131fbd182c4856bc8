The musician and TV host, 64, revealed he was diagnosed in 2014 following a routine blood test while he had no symptoms. Jools said without that it may have been "too late" He said: "If I can bring people's awareness to the facts of prostate cancer then I would certainly stand on top of my piano and shout about it because I think it's really important." Jools has joined forces with charity Prostate Cancer UK to boost knowledge of the disease with an event at the Albert Hall on June 22. Raise the Roof will have pop legends like Paul Weller and Spice Girl Melanie C as well as popular comedians. Jools said after his surprise diagnosis he "was successfully treated but if more people were aware of their risk and caught the disease early, then more lives would be saved." "If Raise the Roof was able to achieve this and save one man's life, it would be the best thing ever that would come out of this." Event hosts will be ex- Strictly star AJ Odudu and comic Jim Moir, with a lineup including Celeste, Paloma Faith and Ruby Turner. Funds from Raise the Roof - the idea of Jools and his pal, Prostate Cancer UK founder Professor Jonathan Waxman - will go to better testing. Prof Waxman added: "Music and comedy connect people so Raise the Roof will light up our summer and enable conversations which can save lives." The charity estimates 14,000 men in England could be undiagnosed and may need urgent treatment. Prof Peter Johnson, clinical director for cancer for NHS England, urged people to use Prostate Cancer UK's online risk checker. He said: "Knowing your risk and, if you're at high-risk, getting yourself checked out, really could save your life."
