Pokemon Go fans are counting down to the launch of the March 13 Community Day. The next Community Day event takes place between 11am and 5pm GMT UK time. The next Community Day puts the spotlight on Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew, making it an essential event. Needless to say, the March 13 Community Day event introduces Shiny Sandshrew and Shiny Alolan Sandshrew, complete with an exclusive move. Evolve Sandshrew during the event or up to two hours afterward to get a Sandslash that knows the Charged Attack Night Slash. Alternatively, evolve Alolan Sandshrew during the event or up to two hours afterward to get an Alolan Sandslash that knows the Fast Attack Shadow Claw. Elsewhere, the March 13 Community Day event features a brand new Special Research Story, titled Gritty and Glacial. Fans can enter the Special Research Story by purchasing a ticket priced at just £1. Event bonuses include reduced Egg Hatching Distance for all Eggs that are placed in an Incubator during the event period. Likewise, Incense and Lure Modules will last for three hours, so save some items if you plan on taking part. If you're low on items, Niantic is selling Community Day bundles for 1,280 PokeCoins. The March Community Day bundle contains 30 Ultra Balls, three Super Incubators, five Lucky Eggs, and one Elite Charged TM. "A bundle containing 30 Ultra Balls will be available in the shop at no cost," Niantic explains. "Be sure to pick it up during the event!" Finally, visiting PokeStops and opening gifts will reward players with exclusive Pokemon Go stickers.
