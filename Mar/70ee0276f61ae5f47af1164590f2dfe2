And a poll from broker Credit Karma found that 20 percent of adults have used credit or taken out a loan worth on average £439 in the last three months. For the population at large this means we have racked up another £4.7billion in debt this year. Some 40 percent have cut back on heating or using electronics, while others have run down savings. And 25 percent say energy, with lower incomes, has priced them out of necessities. Akansha Nath, at Credit Karma, said it was harder to find cheap deals for gas and electricity. She added: “Turning to credit to make ends meet has become essential for many. While much of this is outside of customers’ control, there are things they can do to ease their financial stress.” The energy price cap will rise by £693 from April 1 for approximately 22 million customers.
