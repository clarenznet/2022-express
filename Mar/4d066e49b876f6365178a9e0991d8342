Sowing too many seeds at once can sabotage all your gardening efforts, she said. "You don’t need to sow the whole packet, and don’t overcommit yourself, particularly if you are a beginner." She also suggested sowing sweet peas. Pollyanna also detailed "the only method that works" to kill slugs. She said: "Nematodes seems to be the only (nonchemical) thing that works for slugs, and even then, very wet summers such as last year can prove a battle."
