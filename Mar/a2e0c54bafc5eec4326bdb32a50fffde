Diana, Princess of Wales enjoyed many desserts made at Kensington Palace, but her “favourite” was a crepe souffle topped with apricot jam. Darren McGrady, who worked at the royal palaces as a chef between 1982 and 1993, now runs a YouTube channel where he reveals royal anecdotes about working for the Queen and the late Princess Diana. In the film Spencer starring Kristen Stewart as the Princess, she could be seen asking the head chef Darren McGrady for her favourite dessert – crepe souffle d’apricots.  Darren detailed the recipe to his YouTube followers on March 28 to serve eight portions.

Next, grease the ring moulds and place in the oven for about five to eight minutes to get hot. Mix all of the ingredients together in a large bowl (except the egg whites and apricot jam) and fold in the whipped egg whites.  Ladle into the moulds and cook until risen and golden brown. The moulds should take eight to 10 minutes for four-inch sized ones, 15 to 20 minutes for nine-inch moulds, and 20 to 25 minutes for a casserole dish. Heat the apricot jam and strain through a sieve. Place one of the shuffles onto a serving dish, ladle over some hot jam and place the second one on top. Ladle over more jam. Serve immediately.  Darren said in his YouTube video: “It’s a dish that Princess Diana adored, so when she came to stay with the Queen, I would always put it on the menu. “The Queen would always have a choice of two puddings and so I had to put one on the menu that the Queen didn’t like or wouldn’t pass. “She’d put a line through that one – usually something like prune bread! “So then, that meant Princess Diana was going to get the crepe souffle. “I know it was underhand, but the Queen did like crepe souffle too, so they both got to enjoy it!”
