The Local Authority Revenue Expenditure and Finance 2021-22 budget report reflects, for the first time, the financial impact of COVID-19, as local councils have had to fork out billions more than what was previously budgeted for over the last financial year. Which areas have received increased funding and are any cuts due to take place? The net current expenditure on services is budgeted to be £105.6 billion for 2021-22, which is £5.2 billion higher (5.1 percent) than the £100.5 billion budget set for 2020-21 when adjusted for inflation. This amounts to a stark £6.2 billion increase (6.2 percent) than what was budgeted for 2019-20. Net current expenditure is the offset expenditure of running local authority services, which include areas such as staffing, heating, lighting, and cleaning. The expenditure is offset by income from sales, fees and charges, and other (non-grant) income, which all in all, total the net current expenditure.

Revenue expenditure accounts for “other current expenditure” in addition to service expenditure and non-current expenditure. Other current expenditure includes housing benefits paid to residents, any money passed down to parish councils through local precepts, and any additional levies and adjustments charged during the year. The budget recorded for the total revenue expenditure totalled £110.3 billion in 2021-22, £6.2 billion more than what was initially budgeted for in 2020-21, and £7.7 billion (7.5 percent) higher than what was budgeted for 2019-20 when adjusted for inflation.

However, despite the Government’s “Levelling Up” ambitions, which is a programme designed to reduce imbalances - primarily economic - between areas and social groups in the United Kingdom with increased funding, there are still plans to cut local council spending over the year. Analysis by NationalWorld found, when adjusted for inflation, that nearly £320 million less funding to local councils is planned for the year ahead, compared to the last.  Cuts are said to range from one percent to 2.6 percent depending on the council. This poses the question, how are local councils expected to deliver on the Levelling Up ambitions, of which they are due to play a major role in, with less budget? The budget forecast for the next financial year is due to be released in June 2022.
