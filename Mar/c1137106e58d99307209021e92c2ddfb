As well as being a royal residence containing Her Majesty’s private home and a working palace, the castle has a long history dating back to the 11th century. Although the castle has around 1,000 rooms to hide in, the 484,000 square foot estate also contains an escape route for the monarch.  According to a report, hidden away under one of the office carpets is a secret trap door that leads into a tunnel. It would be perfect if the Queen needs to hide or make a quick escape. In 2011, the BBC broadcast footage of the escape route in their documentary The Queen’s Palaces. Presenter Fiona Bruce said you can still find evidence of the castle’s “war like origins”.  Describing the setting for viewers Ms Bruce said the “secret passage” could “accommodate a whole army of men”. She said: “This is an office just tucked away in a corner of Windsor Castle. But look under here. “As if by magic, just lift these and the mediaeval castle emerges.” Walking down the stone steps Ms Bruce gave a glimpse inside the tunnel itself.
