Jurgen Klopp could be heard shouting in frustration at the UEFA match officials over their failure to stop Liverpool's Champions League clash with Inter Milan sooner, following a medical emergency in the crowd. The Reds' last-16 encounter with the Italian champions was called to a halt temporarily just after the 20-minute mark, following the scare that was unfolding in the Kop end.  Eagle-eyed Klopp was seemingly quick to spot the incident amid an eerie, fast-changing atmosphere inside the ground. Virgil van Dijk had just pinged a long, raking cross-field ball to Mohamed Salah that just evaded the Egyptian, when the game was stopped. Klopp was screaming at the referee and fourth official to stop play and as medics rushed to the scene, the German continued to echo his fury. Conversations then continued on the near side between the Liverpool manager and the officials and Klopp did not look best-pleased, while also showing his concern.

Shortly after, Klopp turned to the edge of the pitch and called his players off the turf for a quick tactical message. Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi also did the same as both sets of players welcomed a quick break, following a frantic opening to the match. Thankfully, it wasn't long before the players were invited back out onto the field to continue play.  A rapturous applause had broken out in the Anfield crowd, which it appeared to signal that the situation was under control. Five minutes of stoppage time were later added on before the interval. BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey did address the incident during the half-time break. He said: "No news at the moment on that fan that was taken ill in the Kop. As soon as we know, we will let you know."
