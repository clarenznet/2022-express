The bus operator is selling itself to DWS for £549.9million - almost £74million more than the earlier deal. In December Stagecoach agreed to merge with National Express in what was effectively a takeover. National Express's shareholders would have owned three-quarters of the combined firm. That deal valued Stagecoach at 87.8p per share or £476million. However, yesterday Stagecoach's board withdrew its backing and urged shareholders to agree to the offer from DWS. It will buy the Perth-based company for 105p per share. Stagecoach boss Martin Griffiths said: "The proposed offer [from DWS] presents a major opportunity to maximise the significant growth potential ahead as governments seek to deliver economic recovery, level up communities, provide better health outcomes for citizens, and transition to a net zero future. "We believe it will open a new and exciting chapter for Stagecoach, backed by a team who share our vision for a more sustainable future. "We also believe it will deliver positive outcomes both now and in the long-term for all of our key stakeholders." What is happening where you live?
