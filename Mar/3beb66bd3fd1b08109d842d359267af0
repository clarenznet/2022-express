Will Smith rushed on stage to slap Chris Rock after he aimed a joke towards Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, during the 94th Academy Awards ceremony last night. Rock had joked: “Jada, can't wait for GI Jane 2.” in reference to Pinkett Smith's shaven head. Smith walked on stage to hit Rock before returning to his seat and shouting: "Keep my wife's name out of your f****** mouth." Rock resumed presenting the best documentary feature category and said: “That was the greatest night in the history of television.” Smith won Best Actor for his role in biopic King Richard as the father of a young Venus and Serena Williams. When accepting his award he defended his actions saying he felt compelled to defend his family. He said: “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and to be in this world.” He added: “I know to do what we do you’ve got to be able to take abuse, and have people talk crazy about you and have people disrespecting you, and you’ve got to smile and pretend it’s OK. But love will make you do crazy things.” His speech thanked and apologised to many, but notably, there was no mention of Rock. He concluded: “Thank you, I’m hoping the Academy invites me back.” The Academy later tweeted: “The Academy does not condone violence of any form.” Many viewers were left unsure if the moment was staged but it is possible that the reference to Pinkett Smith's hair angered Smith as she had spoken publicly about her alopecia.
