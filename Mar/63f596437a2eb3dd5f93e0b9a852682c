His spokesperson confirmed Prince Harry’s decision but no reason was given for his planned absence. This comes amid the Duke of Sussex's ongoing legal case over his security arrangements in the UK. Westminster Abbey is hosting a Service of Thanksgiving for Prince Philip later this month to commemorate his relationship with the Abbey. The service is an opportunity for family and friends, dignitaries and representatives of the charities and organisations that Philip was associated with to pay tribute to him. Last year, Harry returned to the UK to attend his grandfather’s funeral in Windsor, which was limited to 30 guests due to Covid restrictions. Harry most recently returned to the UK last summer to unveil the statue of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales on July 1 with his brother Prince William. The spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said on Friday he hopes “to visit the Queen as soon as possible”. Weeks after Philip’s memorial service, Harry will reportedly travel across the Atlantic to The Hague for the Invictus Games in April, a sporting event he founded for military veterans in 2014. Harry moved to California with his wife Meghan Markle and their son Archie, now two, in 2020 after stepping back from royal duties. Their daughter Lilibet, nine months, the Queen’s twelfth great-grandchild, is yet to visit the UK. So what do YOU think? Is Harry doing the right thing by not attending Philip’s memorial service?
