Dnipro Kids, a charity founded by Hibernian FC fans, has evacuated to Poland 48 children from orphanages in Ukraine and wants to bring them to Scotland. She said: "I have been working directly with the Ukrainian government and asked for their permission to bring these children to the UK. "I am extremely grateful to the authorities in Ukraine, who have now confirmed to me that the children can come here. We are working urgently with Poland to ensure the children's swift arrival to the UK." The children, aged two to 15 and from five orphanages, are now in a hotel near Poznan. The Daily Express has highlighted the battle to get them out. They will fly to the UK on Monday. Sally Becker, dubbed the Angel of Mostar for her aid work during the Bosnian War in the early 1990s, has assisted the charity out in Poland. She said last night: "We spent most of today at the Visa and Immigration Office in Warsaw while our project manager uploaded hundreds of documents that were required to process all the applications. "We are delighted that permission has been granted for all the children from Dnipro to come to the UK."
