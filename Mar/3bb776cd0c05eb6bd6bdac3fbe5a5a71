  Comic Relief viewers were wowed by Sir Lenny Henry tonight, with some unable to get their heads around how youthful the comedian looked. Sir Lenny, 63, who co-founded Comic Relief back in 1985, kicked off this year’s Red Nose Day telethon.      Tonight, Comic Relief was filmed in Salford and presented by Doctor Who actor David Tennant, Top Gear’s Paddy McGuinness and pop star Alesha Dixon. Sir Lenny’s presence on stage proved to be a distraction, however, as people just couldn’t get over his age-defying looks. The comedian looked trim in a navy suit, which he paired with a bright blue shirt. BBC viewers took to Twitter to share their amazement at the comedian’s appearance on the show.

It has worked!” Writing yesterday in The Mirror about Red Nose Day and why it's so important, Sir Henry said: “Every year it feels like Red Nose Day comes round faster and faster – maybe that’s a sign I’m getting older. “But it also feels like the need for an evening of laughter, and using its unique power to fundraise for people who urgently need our help, is more relevant than ever. “Red Nose Day is back tomorrow on BBC One for the 19th time, and as always, we aim to bring you another night of fun, famous faces and never-seen-before comedy sketches.        “It has always been more than that though, it’s the chance to come together and help other people. That’s people in your local communities across the UK, but also people in need around the world. “I started Comic Relief with Richard Curtis in 1985 to support millions of people affected by the Ethiopian famine. This crisis created more than 400,000 refugees and displaced over 2.5 million. “When I watched the public raise more than £15million during the first televised Red Nose Day in 1988, I was astounded.” Donate to Comic Relief online at https://www.comicrelief.com/rednoseday.
