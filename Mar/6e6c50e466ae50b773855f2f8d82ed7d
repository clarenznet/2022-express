Branded supplies from stand-alone sites are often more expensive, said Which?. Pump prices have rocketed recently to record highs, adding to cost-of-living pressures on motorists. Which? says fuel at store pumps is typically a few pence cheaper per litre, while town and city locations tend to charge less than rural garages. The consumer champion said motorists using supermarket loyalty cards when filling up can make further savings. Data firm Experian Catalist said a litre of petrol hit a record average 161.1p last Thursday, up 5.5p in five days and adding Â£3 to the cost of filling a family car's tank. Average diesel cost soared to a record 170.1p a litre.   Natalie Hitchins, Which? head of home products and services, said: "The best prices are often found at supermarket forecourts. When filling up, remember that most cars get little benefit from expensive premium unleaded petrol." Tips to keep fuel consumption low include driving smoothly, changing gears early to avoid revving - and reducing speed.
