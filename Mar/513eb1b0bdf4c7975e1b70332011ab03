When looking at alcoholic beverages in general, one in five mums enjoy a special tipple at least four times a week. Mothers voted for lemons (35 percent) over limes (27 percent) when asked what completes the perfect G&T - with one in five preferring a combination of the two. Craft Gin Club’s poll of 2,000 mothers found 39 percent would opt for family time at home rather than at a restaurant this Mother's Day. A quarter (25 percent) preferred time to themselves, with 13 percent hoping for some pamper time alone. It also emerged more than a quarter (26 percent) would prefer not to have gin garnishes - but for those who do, the top 10 included lemon zest (22 percent), strawberry slices (21 percent) and raspberry slices (17 percent). Others would opt for dried orange slices (14 percent), juniper berries (14 percent) and dried grapefruit slices (10 percent). For offspring on a tight budget, the majority of mums agreed they’d rather have the perfect cocktail at home - instead of one in a bar. Sarah Willingham, from Craft Gin Club, said: “We’re delighted to see that gin is still top of the wishlist for mum’s celebrating their special day this year. “Whether it be to enjoy quality family time or for some well-deserved “me-time”, with Craft Gin Club, mothers can treat themselves to high quality gins poured exactly to taste, and pair this with premium tonics and garnishes to enjoy this Mother’s Day.” Craft Gin Club has announced their latest competition will offer a chance to win from more than fifty prizes - including a full year’s Craft Gin Club and Bloom & Wild membership, bottles of premium craft gin, bespoke Mother’s Day gin bundles, and vouchers to spend at the Craft Gin Club store.
