Tracey Connelly is due to leave jail in weeks, after officials said there was "limited benefit" to her first spending time in an open prison. But the Justice Secretary said yesterday he will appeal. Child protection specialists warned Baby P "was failed multiple times" and the impending release has prompted renewed questions. Connelly, 40, was jailed in 2009 over son Peter's death. The 17-month-old had more than 50 injuries including fractured ribs and a broken back when he died in August 2007 at the hands of Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker and lodger Jason Owen at their home in Tottenham, north London. The case sparked outrage as he was on the at-risk register and had 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals in eight months. Under reforms unveiled yesterday, ministers would have the power to block his mother's release as she was found guilty of allowing the death of a child. But sources could not say when the change will come into force. Instead, Mr Raab is challenging the Parole Board decision on the grounds he thinks it is "irrational", the Daily Express understands. This means the Ministry does not believe officials considered properly the risk Connelly may pose to society. Decisions may be reviewed for being "irrational [or] unreasonable" or if procedural errors have been made.  Connelly was refused parole three times in seven years but it is understood all professional witnesses to the board's latest review supported her release. The Government representative confirmed the recommendation was accepted. But Mr Raab told MPs: "Having carefully read the decision, I have decided to apply to the Parole Board to seek their reconsideration." Shadow justice secretary Steve Reed said: "I fully support the Secretary of State." Connelly was given a minimum five years for causing or allowing Peter's death. She was released in 2013 on lifelong licence but was sent back to jail in 2015 for selling pornographic pictures of herself.
