On March 22, 2017, twisted Khalid Masood ploughed his car into pedestrians on the bridge and a street outside Parliament, injuring 50 and killing four people. The jihadi fanatic, wearing a fake suicide belt, then ran into Parliament Square and fatally stabbed unarmed PC Palmer, 48, before he was shot dead by police. At the memorial service, outgoing Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said: "PC Keith Palmer paid the ultimate price defending the UK's heart of democracy, "And alongside him we remember Aysha Frade, Kurt Cochran, Leslie Rhodes and Andreea Cristea." "Sadly, the threat from terrorism remains. However, we are inspired by the courage displayed on that day by so many people. "It is the memory of the victims and the survivors of all the attacks that drives us in policing to continually improve, so that we can do all we possibly can to prevent further attacks from happening again."
