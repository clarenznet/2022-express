Lewis Hamilton is likely to be encouraged by Max Verstappen's recent prediction that mid-season development will be the most important factor in deciding the outcome of this year's battle for Drivers' Championship glory. Mercedes endured a turbulent time of things at pre-season testing in Bahrain earlier this week and have been tipped to slip behind the likes of Red Bull and Ferrari when the competitive action gets back underway next weekend. The Silver Arrows have won eight successive Constructors' Championship titles over the last eight years and will be desperate to seal an unprecedented ninth triumph over the coming months.However, it seems likely that Mercedes could struggle to challenge their rival teams for Grand Prix wins during the early stages of the new season.Both of their drivers have already insisted that it will be nigh-on impossible to turn up at next week's Bahrain Grand Prix and storm to victory after struggling to fine-tune their W13 challenger during pre-season.Verstappen has since declared that the battle is far from being won or lost at this stage by underlining the importance of continuing their development throughout the upcoming campaign.When quizzed on Ferrari's standing after this week's test in Bahrain, the Dutchman told Motorsport.com: "You automatically start looking at this season a bit earlier than some of the other teams.

They introduced a comprehensive upgrade package at the British Grand Prix, which was eventually won by Hamilton after an early collision with Verstappen that rendered the 24-year-old unable to continue.Mercedes went on to claim the top prize at five of the last eight races to seal yet another Constructors' Championship title at the expense of Red Bull.It remains to be seen whether they will be able to mount a similar resurgence over the next few weeks as they look to maximise their potential ahead of this year's upcoming battle for glory.Hamilton recently insisted that Mercedes will have plenty of work to do to avoid slipping behind Ferrari and Red Bull when the new season finally begins next weekend.

We've just got to learn to be able to extract it and fix some of the problems, which is what we're working on."We have some hurdles to overcome and obviously next week we'll get a much better showing of our pace, but I think people will be surprised."People keep talking about whether we're talking ourselves down or not, but it's a bit different this year."
