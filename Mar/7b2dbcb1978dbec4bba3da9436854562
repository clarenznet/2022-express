The 15-year-old victim was rushed to hospital with serious injuries after bleeding on the street following the attack by a bus stop in Toxteth, Liverpool. Police have since arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. Shortly after the shooting, a man in his 20s arrived at hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand. Enquiries are being carried out to establish if the two injuries are linked. Neighbours today told how people rushed to help the teenager and one ran to give the girl a scarf to stop the bleeding. A mum, who lives on the street, said: "I heard about four loud bangs from in the house. I asked my friend who just came round if she heard it, and she said 'no'. "Next thing I know there’s police and ambulance everywhere and somebody saying a schoolgirl was shot outside. "My neighbour said she gave her her scarf to tie around her and stop the bleeding. "Nothing like this happens around here, it’s terrifying when it’s right on your doorstep." Police remain at the scene today, reports the Liverpool Echo. Officers are carrying out house-to-house, forensic and CCTV enquiries. Another resident, who is a father, was "absolutely disgusted" to learn of the shooting. "To think a child was in the middle of all this. I hope she’s okay," he added. "It’s absolutely disgusting what has happened here. "I went over because I saw a girl collapsed on the floor. Police where everywhere and that’s when I put two and two together." It is understood the girl is now in a stable condition. Speaking last night, a spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: "We can confirm that officers are this evening, Tuesday 1st March, at the scene of an injury shooting in Toxteth. "We were contacted at 5.10pm following reports that shots had been fired on Upper Warwick Street and that a teenage girl had been injured. "Enquiries are being carried out to establish if the two injuries are linked."
