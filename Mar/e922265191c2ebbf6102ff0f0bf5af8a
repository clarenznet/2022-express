  ITV talk show host Lorraine Kelly has revealed to Express.co.uk she went from a size 10 to a size 14 over lockdown. The journalist has teamed up with WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) in the hopes of losing weight, but admitted that she would need to start eating differently to husband Steve, who has no awareness of the issues surrounding portion sizes.      Lorraine, 62, spoke about how she was dismayed to find that she had shot up two dress sizes due to a lack of exercise and indulging in more junk food during lockdown. Lorraine has been married to TV cameraman Steve since 1992, and the couple share a 27-year-old daughter named Rosie. When asked about how Steve fits into her new wellness plan, Lorraine confessed that she would need to exercise portion control, as her husband “just doesn’t understand” it. She said: “My husband loves to cook and he cooks things from scratch, but he just gives himself bigger portions now and I get proper, normal, portions because my husband has got no sense of portions.

It’s been fantastic just knowing what all that is.” Lorraine went on to describe how Steve often likes to cook for her and praised his skills in the kitchen. Reflecting on the changes they’ve made since Lorraine joined WW, she continued: “Steve’s making a massive bowl of homemade soup on Sunday and that does me for half the week. “And then dinner - I’m still having it with him -  just in smaller portions, and he’s cooking it in a healthier way.     “It’s just little tweaks and changes so you don’t feel… Because the worst thing in the world is feeling deprived. “So I think to myself, ‘I’m not having that biscuit because I don’t really want it.’ “I’m not saying, ‘Oh, I can’t have it’, because then you’re going to want it!” Lorraine went on to divulge one particularly unhealthy junk food habit that had led to her gaining weight during lockdown.

Remembering the way she used to eat during lockdown, she said: “I think the pandemic made all of us a bit like that. I know a lot of people used it as an opportunity to get really fit and honestly, I’m in awe. “But for me? No, I just ate far too much rubbish. Every night, me and my husband would share a chocolate plate and every night it got bigger and bigger, and that was at 7 o’clock at night, and that’s not good. “So I’ve kind of stopped with the chocolate plate. If he wants it, that’s fine.”      Later in the interview, when asked if her husband Steve Smith would ever tempt her away from her WW plan, Lorraine cited her love for chocolate as the main source of trouble. “That was part of the downfall, was mine and Steve’s chocolate plate,” she admitted. “We still have a chocolate plate and it’s still there, but I’ve just said to myself, ‘I can have that if I want, but I’m not going to.’ “I don’t want to be the food police. He’s allowed to have it, but I’m hoping that some of this is going to rub off on him…” Lorraine Kelly has joined WW as a new ambassador. #joinLorraine on her weight loss and wellness journey with WW, where you can enjoy the foods you love with no restrictions.
