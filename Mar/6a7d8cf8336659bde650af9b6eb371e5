      Former fiancée Elizabeth Hurley was not able to attend Sunday’s funeral as work commitments kept her away from Australia. She shared photographs on her Instagram, with the words: "My heart aches that I can’t be in Australia tomorrow for Shane’s funeral. "I was filming last night and, with the time jump, physically can’t get there. "These pictures were taken in Sri Lanka to celebrate our engagement.    "We had all our children with us. "It was the happiest time. "It still hasn’t really sunk in that he’s gone. "It seems too cruel that all the people who loved him will never have another Lion hug. "But our memories will live forever. "RIP Lionheart, with love your Luna."
