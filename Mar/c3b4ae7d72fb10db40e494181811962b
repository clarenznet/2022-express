Rihanna, 34, looked phenomenal as she put her budding baby bump on display on Saturday. The mum-to-be attended the launch of Fenty Beauty at ULTA Beauty in Los Angeles. She stunned fans as she made an appearance in a silver bralet with long sleeves that revealed her bump. The singer accessorised the shimmery look with a chain around her waist and matching earrings. Pictures show the Umbrella singer cradling her bump and holding up various Fenty Beauty products as she smiled broadly. She also posed alongside a bright orange car with the brand’s logo on it. The glamorous pop star opted to style her hair in a slick ponytail and wore silver eyeliner to match her outfit and accessories.
