Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said that Moscow had warned “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defence systems, anti-tank missiles and so on”.  He told Russian state TV: “We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets." US President Joe Biden warned that direct conflict between Russia and Nato would be "World War Three". It comes as Vladimir Putin's devastating invasion of Ukraine is now in its third week.
