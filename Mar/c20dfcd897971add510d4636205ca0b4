Lilibet ‘Lili’ Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on June 4, 2021, in California. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, moved to the States with their son, Archie, now two, in 2020 after retreating from public royal life. While travel around Lilibet’s birth was restricted due to Covid, there have been questions over whether the couple will now bring her to Britain to meet her namesake – the Queen. Lilibet, the Queen’s twelfth great-grandchild, was named after the Monarch’s childhood family nickname. This week, royal author Brian Hoey told Express.co.uk the 95-year-old was very keen to meet Lilibet. He said: "I have heard from people I know within the Royal Household she really would desperately like to see the baby [in person]. "I think she would love to, I wonder whether it is going to happen, I would love to think it could."
