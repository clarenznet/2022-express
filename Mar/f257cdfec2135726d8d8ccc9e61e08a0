  Heidi slipped into a pair of black stockings with cutouts at the hip to accentuate her enviable figure. She paired the criss-cross designed stockings with a delicate white, lacy bra. In a couple of the shots, she could be seen accessorising with a dark blue and gold cap embroidered with the words “Tiesto Racing”. She towered against the backdrop in a pair of shiny black stiletto heels.  Heidi wore her hair in a tousled, casual style as she posed in front of the window, which revealed the large buildings behind her. She captioned the post: “What happens in Vegas…” The post comes after the model was seen setting off on a road trip with her husband to Las Vegas, Nevada. Heidi, beau Tom Kaulitz, and brother-in-law, Bill are currently on a trip that has taken them through several locations in the Nevada desert.
