Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden last night insisted the Prime Minister was not concerned about the police probe into Downing Street parties. He spoke out following reports that police have begun interviewing leading witnesses. He said: "The Prime Minister is actually, absolutely, resolutely clear that he is not going to be subject to a fixed penalty notice because he is confident that he's not broken the law. "The PM's pretty clear he's obeyed the law." Mr Dowden added: "I speak to the Prime Minister a lot, as you might imagine as party chairman.That is not where his mind is. "I've been spending an awful lot of time discussing Ukraine, cost of living and so on.We are genuinely getting on with the job with dealing with that - and that's where our focus is." A Downing Street source said the PM has not been interviewed by police investigating the so-called "partygate" allegations. The Met said more than 100 questionnaires have been sent out so far to people at the alleged gatherings, which have to be completed and returned in seven days. Police investigators have started reviewing available evidence but have not yet made any referrals for potential fines to be issued. The Metropolitan Police said: "The offences under consideration comprise a number of elements and the legislation changed between the event dates. "We are progressing the investigation as quickly as possible.As yet, we have not made any referrals for issuing of fixed-penalty notices." The force is probing 12 events, including as many as six which Mr Johnson is reported to have attended. Mr Johnson faced calls to quit over partygate.
