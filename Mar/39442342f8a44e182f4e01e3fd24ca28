All I can say this time is that the Royal Opera has done it again, with a complete change of cast, though the outstanding performances this time were in different roles. Last time, it was the stunning performance of Lisette Oropesa in the tragic role of Gilda that was brilliantly impressive; this time, Italian soprano Rosa Feola in the same role was almost as good, though her voice had slightly less emotional power. However, her fellow Italian, baritone Luca Salsi, sang and acted the title role to perfection, with great support in all the other main roles. The tragic plot is based on a play "Le roi s'amuse" by Victor Hugo set in the city of Mantua, which is ruled by a powerful and evil Duke. The hunchback Rigoletto is the Duke's jester, gaining pleasure by making fun of the Duke's victims until one of them curses him. His daughter, whom he has kept hidden away for her own safety, is kidnapped by the courtiers who think she is his mistress, and the Duke, who has already taken a fancy to her, has his evil way with her. Rigoletto vows revenge and pays the assassin Sparafucile to murder the Duke, but it is Gilda who is killed instead. Quite apart from having a beautifully powerful voice, Salsi brings out the tortured character of Rigoletto to perfection, while the tenor Francesco Demuro brings real malice to the part of the Duke of Mantua. Evgeny Stavinsky makes a convincingly professional assassin as Sparafucile, while Aigul Akhmetshina was delightfully slutty as his murderous sister Maddalena. Rigoletto has the most gripping plot of all Verdi's operas, and this cast brought out the drama with perfection. An exceptionally fine performance of a great production of a superb opera. A terrific evening's entertainment. Tickets: roh.org.uk or 020 7304 4000 Remaining performances: 8 and 12 March 2022.
