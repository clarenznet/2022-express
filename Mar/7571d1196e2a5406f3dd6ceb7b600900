Emergency services raced to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary in the West Yorkshire town after reports of an over-heated boiler. Photos show people evacuated from parts of the hospital as it is believed there were fears of an explosion. People had to stand in the car park when fire crews arrived. But it is understood they have now been allowed to return to the buildings. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said: "We got calls at 10.55am to reports of an overheated boiler but we’ve left the scene." The hospital told Yorkshire Live some people were asked to evacuate today for a "precautionary measure."  "We can confirm that a boiler pressure leak at HRI led to some patients and colleagues in ward block two being evacuated," a spokesman for Huddersfield Royal Infirmary (HRI) said. "This was purely a precautionary measure. “The boiler fault was identified as part of routine monitoring of our boiler system. "Fire alarms were activated as part of the evacuation and the fire brigade are in attendance. However we can confirm there is no fire on site. "Our boiler maintenance provider is onsite to making the necessary repairs. "In the meantime we’re asking people to avoid the Accident and Emergency Department at HRI and to instead use the A&E at Calderdale Royal Hospital." Officers from West Yorkshire Police were pictured at the scene and the force have been contacted for comment.
