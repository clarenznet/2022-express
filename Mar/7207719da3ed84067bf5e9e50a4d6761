Tipping Point host Ben Shephard welcomed four new players Claire, Phill, Anne and Joe onto the ITV show. After Claire and Phill were knocked out, Anne and Joe were left to battle it out in a series of general knowledge questions. Despite getting far in the quiz, drama teacher Joe left the host in fits of laughter when he gave a rather unusual response to a question based on US states.  Ben asked: “The three US states that begin and end in letter A are Alabama, Alaska and which other?” Confusing viewers by the offset, Joe appeared to list a series of states such as Las Vegas, New York, and Miami but then stopped when he said “Florida”. “Think you might have got it?” Ben asked as the player replied: “Yeah, I might do.” The host asked: “What are you going to say?” READ MORE:Vera star addresses filming blunders with Kenny Doughty  Taking a stab at the question, Joe replied: “Florida,” before turning away and asking: “No?” “No, I’m not [sure now]” he followed while his fellow player Anne began to chuckle. “Anne, did you have it?” Ben wondered. Still giggling at Joe’s answer, Anne answered: “I think it was Arizona.”   “There you go, that makes sense,” Joe reflected. As both Anne and Ben began to break out into fits of laughter, Ben laughed: “Let’s see. It was Arizona, Joe I’m sorry, you went for it and you were spectacularly wrong.” “I was convincing myself it was the right answer,” Joe added. ITV viewers took to social media to share their thoughts on Joe’s responses with @Marina_Lou73 jesting: “Good job Joe doesn’t teach Geography…… #tippingpoint.” (Sic)   In jest, @ClintonBaptis12 said: “Hilarious sleepy Joe  #tippingpoint," while @Trevor_Tau1 echoed: “Florida begins with an 'A'.- Joe  #tippingpoint.” Others claimed Joe was one of “the funniest” contestants the show had ever seen. @AFCBAMBOS wrote: “I salute you Joe, one of the funniest contestants ever on #tippingpoint.”
