Set for Life has a smaller jackpot than many other National Lottery games - but who could say no to an extra £10,000 a month in their bank account? As one of the most recent additions to the National Lottery, Set for Life has proved incredibly popular and could provide you with that much-needed income stream to make many of your dreams come true. Set for Life draws take place every Monday and Thursday at 8pm. It works in the same way as other lottery games - all you have to do is pick the right numbers. In Set for Life, you need to pick five main numbers between one and 47, and a ‘life ball’ between one and ten. You can play online, on the National Lottery app, or with a physical ticket in your local newsagents. If you win while playing online, you will be notified by email or a phone call. You need to be aged 18 or over to play all National Lottery games. All you need to do now is sit back and wait to see if you are the lucky winner tonight. Tonight’s Set for Life draw numbers are: 18, 26, 29, 41, 42. The Life Ball is 2.
