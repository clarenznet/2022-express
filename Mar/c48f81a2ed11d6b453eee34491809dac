The child, just three months old, was attacked in Ostler’s Plantation, Woodhall Spa, in Lincolnshire. Police were called to the area east of Lincoln at 11.13 pm on Sunday. A 54-year-old man and a woman, 40, have been arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog that was out of control. Lincolnshire Police confirmed that they both remain in custody. Chief Superintendent Andy Cox described his horror at the incident. He added the force was grateful to the local community for their support. He said: “This is an exceptionally sad incident, and one that we know will impact the local community, or indeed anyone hearing about it. "There may be a temptation to speculate about what happened while people attempt to understand this tragedy, and we’d ask people to avoid doing so, particularly on social media where facts can become distorted. "We will do everything we can to establish what has happened, and we’d like to thank everyone for their support.” The area of the attack is a well-known favourite of local dog walkers. News of the tragedy comes the same day as a mother whose newborn baby was killed by an out-of-control dog is told she will not face a criminal trial. Elon Jase Ellis-Joynes was just 12 days old when he was attacked by a Chow Chow-cross in Doncaster in 2020. The baby’s father, Steven Joynes, had previously pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog that was dangerously out of control, causing injury resulting in death. On Monday, the same charge against Elon’s mother, Abigail Ellis, was dropped. Prosecutors told Sheffield Crown Court that “a not guilty verdict will be sought” at the next hearing. Barrister Richard Thyne added, in light of Elon’s father’s guilty plea, a conviction against Miss Ellis was no longer “realistic”. Mr Joynes will be sentenced on March 31. Both were granted bail by Mrs Justice Lambert.
