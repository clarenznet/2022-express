Jamie, 48, and his new wife Frida Redknapp, 38, welcomed their first child together, a boy named Raphael, in November last year. The pair married in an intimate ceremony in London, in October 2021. Frida has now taken to Instagram to share a photo with her daughter from her previous marriage to Jonathan Lourie, after a boxing session. She has four children with business tycoon Jonathan. The pair wore similar gym sets in different colours, with Frida still wearing her boxing wraps in the shot. Despite having just had baby Raphael, Frida boasted an incredibly toned midriff. She captioned the snap, which was uploaded on Sunday: “Great session with my girl.” A separate shot featured the pair sitting outside JAB Boxing Club in Mayfair, London, as they enjoyed a drink.
