Suella Braverman insisted that gathering evidence of wrongdoing must begin straight away. She said the UK has signed a joint statement with Ukraine reaffirming support in holding Russia accountable for crimes that it is committing on Ukrainian soil. There was global outrage last week after the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol that killed three civilians, including a child. The UN has said, "intentional and direct attacks on hospitals are war crimes". Individuals can be held responsible for war crimes where civilians have not been distinguished from armed forces, and have faced indiscriminate attacks. Ms Braverman said: "Russia's crimes might be tried in the courtrooms of Kyiv, The Hague or even in the UK; but whatever the forum, it is critical to gather the evidence now. The evidence is there, the world can see it accruing." She added: "We will always defend the Ukrainian people's right to choose their own future. They have chosen freedom and justice. And Russia's war criminals have chosen to be behind bars." Justice Secretary Dominic Raab was heading to The Hague today to assist the international effort to gather evidence.
