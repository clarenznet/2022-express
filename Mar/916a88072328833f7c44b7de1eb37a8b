The ongoing piracy clampdown continues, with scores of websites that offered free and illegal access to content from Netflix, Sky TV, Prime Video now blocked. The latest crackdown will see people in the UK who use major broadband providers like BT, EE, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk and Plusnet barred from accessing these piracy sites - including one called TorrentGalaxy, which attracts around 17 million visits a month. The block comes after Netflix and other major Hollywood studios lobbied for a court order from the High Court. The Squid Game makers are part of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), which is a group of major entertainment brands including Disney, Warner Bros and Paramount who are regularly at the forefront of efforts to block piracy websites. The MPA has been involved in getting hundreds of piracy websites blocked, and are showing no signs of slowing down their efforts to crackdown on internet piracy. The latest High Court injunction the MPA obtained has blocked some major torrent sites, including the aforementioned TorrentGalaxy - which is one of the top 10 most popular torrent sites for 2022. Other torrent sites that have been blocked in the UK are Zooqle and MagnetDL, which get around five million and six million visits each month respectively, TorrentFreak reported.  The latest round of blocks targets some of the biggest torrent portals around that so far have evaded efforts to bar users from accessing these sites. Other domains that can't be visited anymore in the UK include TorrentLeech, which is a members-only page, and GloTorrents. This site receives around 1.3million visits each month, so it's not as big a player as some of the other pages that have now been blocked. However, almost a third (30 percent) of traffic to GloTorrents is from the UK, which is why it's in the crosshairs of the High Court order. If you're wondering which sites now can't be accessed in the UK then you can find the full list below. Besides being illegal to access copyrighted content without paying for it, visiting torrent websites poses plenty of other risks - including downloading malware that can harm a PC, identity theft and more. Speaking about the dangers of illegal downloads, Kieron Sharp - CEO of anti-piracy organisation FACT, previously said: "While it’s good to see that so many people are aware of the illegality of piracy, there appears to be a lack of understanding about the very real risks consumers face, with many unwittingly putting themselves in danger as a result. "Identity theft, fraud and exposure to malware and viruses as a result of piracy are all too real. I’d ask anyone who is considering turning to illegal content to think twice about whether it’s worth risking giving criminals access to your devices and bank accounts."  glodls.to, gtdb.to glotorrents.unblockit.cam glotorrents.u4m.sbs glotorrents.unbl4you.cyou glotorrents.123unblock.world glotorrents.unblockproject.top glotorrents.proxybit.sbs glotorrents.mrunblock.bar glotorrents.g3g.fun  magnetdl.com, magnetdl.org magnetdl.unblockit.cam magnetdl.proxyninja.org rlsbb.ru, rlsbb.to rlsbb.com, releasebb.net proxybb.com, tfp.is tfpdl.se, tfp.unblockit.cam tfpdl.proxybit.sbs tfpdl.unbl4you.cyou tfpdl.123unblock.world  tfpdl.unblockproject.top tfpdl.proxybit.sbs tfpdl.mrunblock.bar tfpdl.g3g.fun torrentgalaxy.to torrentgalaxy.mx torrentgalaxy.su torrentgalaxy.unblockit.cam torrentleech.org zooqle.com  zooqle.unblockit.cam zooqle.u4m.sbs zooqle.unbl4you.cyou zooqle.123unblock.world zooqle.unblockproject.top zooqle.proxybit.sbs zooqle.mrunblock.bar zooqle.g3g.fun zooqle.proxyninja.org mxdcontent.net  a-delivery26.mxdcontent.net s-delivery21.mxdcontent.net s-delivery16.mxdcontent.net s-delivery19.mxdcontent.net s-delivery17.mxdcontent.net s-delivery23.mxdcontent.net s-delivery22.mxdcontent.net a-delivery21.mxdcontent.net s-delivery25.mxdcontent.net s-delivery26.mxdcontent.net  s-delivery27.mxdcontent.net a-delivery30.mxdcontent.net s-delivery28.mxdcontent.net s-delivery29.mxdcontent.net s-delivery30.mxdcontent.net s-delivery31.mxdcontent.net s-delivery32.mxdcontent.net s-delivery33.mxdcontent.net a-delivery18.mxdcontent.net a-delivery19.mxdcontent.net  s-delivery34.mxdcontent.net s-delivery35.mxdcontent.net a-delivery22.mxdcontent.net a-delivery23.mxdcontent.net a-delivery27.mxdcontent.net a-delivery28.mxdcontent.net a-delivery29.mxdcontent.net s-delivery36.mxdcontent.net a-delivery31.mxdcontent.net s-delivery37.mxdcontent.net  s-delivery38.mxdcontent.net a-delivery32.mxdcontent.net a-delivery33.mxdcontent.net a-delivery10.mxdcontent.net a-delivery9.mxdcontent.net a-delivery11.mxdcontent.net a-delivery12.mxdcontent.net a-delivery14.mxdcontent.net a-delivery15.mxdcontent.net a-delivery24.mxdcontent.net  s-delivery18.mxdcontent.net s-delivery13.mxdcontent.net s-delivery9.mxdcontent.net a-delivery1.mxdcontent.net a-delivery2.mxdcontent.net a-delivery3.mxdcontent.net a-delivery4.mxdcontent.net a-delivery5.mxdcontent.net a-delivery6.mxdcontent.net a-delivery7.mxdcontent.net a-delivery8.mxdcontent.net  s-delivery10.mxdcontent.net s-delivery11.mxdcontent.net s-delivery12.mxdcontent.net s-delivery14.mxdcontent.net s-delivery1.mxdcontent.net s-delivery2.mxdcontent.net s-delivery3.mxdcontent.net s-delivery4.mxdcontent.net s-delivery5.mxdcontent.net s-delivery6.mxdcontent.net s-delivery7.mxdcontent.net s-delivery8.mxdcontent.net a-delivery16.mxdcontent.net a-delivery17.mxdcontent.net s-delivery15.mxdcontent.net a-delivery13.mxdcontent.net a-delivery25.mxdcontent.net a-delivery25.mxdcontent.net a-delivery20.mxdcontent.net s-delivery24.mxdcontent.net s-delivery20.mxdcontent.net
