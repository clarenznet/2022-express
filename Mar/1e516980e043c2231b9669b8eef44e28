Amanda and her co-stars Ashley Roberts and Jamie Theakston donned the outfits this morning. The trio dressed up as the characters from The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. Then on their show, they invited Heart Breakfast listeners to share their favourite books. Britainâ€™s Got Talent host Amanda looked stunning as she shared a glimpse at the velvet outfit with her followers. The blue dress had a cross detailing on its front alongside flowing sleeves and a hat. The racy look also featured a short skirt as the presenter showed off her toned legs. She paired it with thigh-high leather heeled boots and a fake sword to complete the look. Her co-star Ashley also looked stunning as she wore a matching outfit for the occasion. Tune in to Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden on weekdays from 6:30am until 10am.
