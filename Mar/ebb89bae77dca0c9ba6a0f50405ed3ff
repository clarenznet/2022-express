  Piers Morgan blasted Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle on social media today, claiming the couple are attempting to “smear the royal family”. The journalist went on to deny that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had received backlash from their Caribbean tour, insisting that they had instead been met with “great warmth and joy”.      Piers, 56, sent out an angry tweet this afternoon in response to an article covering the couple's royal tour. The former Good Morning Britain presenter told his 7.9 million followers: “Actually, despite the best efforts of your beloved Sussexes to smear the Royal Family as a bunch of nasty racists, they’ve been received with great warmth and joy.” He also shared a link to the People article, which was captioned: “Prince William and Kate Middleton Under Pressure as They Face Backlash on Their First Caribbean Tour.” The cover of the magazine attached read: “Royal tour controversy: Facing protests, the couple must navigate a changing world.” READ MORE: ITV News host Mary Nightingale and husband forced to move out of home     Some of Piers’ followers appeared to agree with the journalist, while many others hit back at his take on the issue.

Sort of outdated.” (sic) Paul Edmonds reasoned: “Many of us Jamaicans love the royals. However like the British we also want real independance.” According to the US publication, Prince William and wife Kate are facing “significant backlash” on their first official Caribbean tour.     The claim comes after the Cambridges were forced to change the venue for an event in Belize during their tour after facing opposition from local residents. They now face further protests with Jamaican campaigners accusing the Queen and her predecessors of perpetuating slavery. Meanwhile, as Jamaica marks its 60th anniversary, a coalition of politicians, business leaders, doctors and musicians have called for the British monarchy to pay slavery reparations in an open letter, and a demonstration is expected on Tuesday. Jamaica gained independence from Britain on August 6 1962 but chose to keep the Queen as Sovereign. Last year, another former colony, Barbados, transitioned from a Realm to a republic, and now it seems Jamaica may be heading in the same direction.
