Cats Protection is looking for people to observe and interact with cats at one of their catteries in Kingskerswell, Devon. Since advertising the news roles online, the charity has been inundated with willing applicants, Devon Live says. A post written on the Cats Protection - Teignbridge and Torbay Branch Facebook page says volunteers will help to help socialise the cats using toys and treats which are provided. It reads: "We need volunteer cat cuddlers to help socialise our cats at Foredowne cattery, Kingskerswell, where we rent space. "We specifically need volunteers for a Sunday but it would be good to have a few others for holiday relief for other days of the week too. "Volunteers do not have to feed the cats or clean litter trays; they just observe and interact with the cats. Toys and treats are provided."   Branch Development Manager Nicola Parry said: "Cat fosterers play a vital role in our charity by caring for cats in their own home until a new owner can be found. "No special equipment is needed but cat fosterers do need to have either a spare room or an area in their garden where a cat pen can be housed and, of course, a love of cats is a must. The charity will provide plenty of assistance and support materials for all fosterers. "Offering a temporary home to a cat in need can be an incredibly rewarding experience, and becoming a volunteer for Cats Protection is a great way to meet new friends – both human and feline." People shared their intrigue at the role online. Writing on Facebook, one woman called it her "dream job". Another said: "My ideal job, shame it’s not local." A third stated: "I would love to be a cat cuddler."
