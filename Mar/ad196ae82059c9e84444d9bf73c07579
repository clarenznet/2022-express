Traffic was held on the southbound carriageway near Junction 20 at 8.30am, leaving congestion tailing back to Junction 22. The stretch of affected road sits to the north-east of Warrington in Lancashire.  Traffic monitor Intrix reported earlier this morning that three lanes had been closed while emergency services responded to the crash. It reported delays of up to 55 minutes as traffic was stopped by the road closure. National Highways said a "severe" incident had left "delays of 30 minutes against expected traffic" by 9am. Intrix reported that as of 9.30am one lane remained closed.    It added that there were now extra delays in Warrington and Winwick as a result of the incident. A spokesperson for Cheshire Constabulary told Express.co.uk that a road traffic collision involving two vehicles had occurred two minutes before eight this morning. The incident, which happened between Junctions 19 and 20, appeared to have left no one injured. They added that road had to be closed for a long period as the barrier needed to be repaired.
