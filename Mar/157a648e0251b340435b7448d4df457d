Sebastian Vettel's start to the 2022 F1 season has been delayed even further with Aston Martin confirming on Friday that Nico Hulkenberg will once again race in his seat this weekend. Aston Martin were leaving it until the latest possible date to confirm whether Vettel would return after testing positive for Covid ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix last week.  Vettel was isolating at his home in Switzerland during the Bahrain race and needed to record a negative test in order to fly out to Saudi Arabia. Aston Martin announced on Thursday they were delaying the decision to give the four-time world champion "every opportunity to race". But with FP1 just hours away, Aston Martin have confirmed that Vettel won't be able to race this weekend. Hulkenberg will once again deputise for the German driver, but Aston Martin expect Vettel to be back for the Australian Grand Prix next month. Aston Martin tweeted: "@HulkHulkenberg will practice, qualify and race alongside @lance_stroll. Despite lack of mileage in the #AMR22, Nico coped well in Bahrain and we are sure he will do likewise in Jeddah. "We expect Sebastian Vettel to be fit for the #AustralianGP."  Hulkenberg impressed in parts at the Bahrain Grand Prix, particularly having not raced in F1 for around 18 months. But the German driver did struggle in the end, finishing last of those who took the chequered flag. The 34-year-old did admit that he's not fully comfortable in the AMR22 due to his size. “A few aches and pains here and there,” he told Bild, “a little sore muscles in the neck and a few pressure points. “I’m quite tall and there are always a few places where it’s not 100 percent comfortable. The usual.” He added: “In the training sessions you only drive for short periods and with fresh tyres. The race is much more demanding. "You have to manage a lot more, there’s a lot more going on around you. In addition, the Aston is not that easy to drive. That demanded a lot from me.”
