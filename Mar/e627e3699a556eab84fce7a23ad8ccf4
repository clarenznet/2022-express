Claims about a mutiny in progress surfaced on the Twitter account of Ukraine-born Igor Sushko. Over the past few days, Sushko has been publishing supposedly leaked letters written by an agent of the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia, formerly the Federal Counterintelligence Service, a successor to the KGB. On Monday, March 21, it was reported that Putin put two FSB agents under house arrest: Colonel-General Sergei Beseda, head of the FSB's foreign intelligence branch, and his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh. Now, the FSB is supposedly turning its back to Putin, with a large-scale mutiny being underway within the service, as Sushko claims, pointing at one of his letters. Sushko’s whistleblower claims that the mutiny is being formed because the already leaked letters have not incited yet a military operation in response to Putin’s aggression. Moreover, it is claimed that the mutiny is not yet a coup, or an attempt to overthrow Putin’s regime. Instead, according to the FSB whistleblower, it is an attempt to convince the West to respond militarily, stop the raiding of Ukraine by Russia, and put an end to the deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, another leaked letter, supposedly written by an FSB analyst, came to light by Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian human rights activist who runs the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net. The letter, which was later verified by Bellingcat, warned the total number of Russians killed in the war could have exceeded 10,000, a piece of information which was later confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Defence. Putin’s invasion appears to not be going as planned, which is why security leaders are being punished, according to experts.
