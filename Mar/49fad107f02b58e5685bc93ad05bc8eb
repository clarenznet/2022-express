Scotland Yard suspected a link between her kidnapping and the murder of three sub-postmasters. A builder from Bradford, Donald Neilson, dubbed the Black Panther, was convicted of Lesley's murder and given five life sentences in July 1976. 80 years ago (1942) Rangoon, the capital of the British colony of Burma, fell to the Imperial Japanese Army. British and Indian troops were forced to implement a "scorched earth" policy, destroying anything that might be useful to the invaders. The port was destroyed and the oil terminal was blown up.   21 years ago (2001)Â Divers recovered the wreck of Donald Campbell's speed boat Bluebird from the bottom of Coniston Water in Cumbria. It took three hours to winch the craft from 150ft of water where it had laid since the crash in 1967. Campbell's remains were found soon after.
