Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to miss the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service and Harry will not return home to join his family at the occasion to celebrate his grandfather's life, it has been confirmed. Royal commentator Daniela Elser hit out at Harry's decision, calling it a "d**k move." While no reason has been given, it has been widely speculated that his ongoing battles over his security arrangements and the lack of police protection if he comes, are the reasons. But Ms Elser said: "This is Berkshire we’re talking about, not Basra. If he went back, he would be facing Piers Morgan’s withering column inches, not mortar rounds."Representatives for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were contacted for comment.
