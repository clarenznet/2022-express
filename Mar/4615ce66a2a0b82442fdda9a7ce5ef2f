The tattoo on the left cheek of Kaylie Williams’ rear, reads ‘Daniel Forde’, the name of a man she met on a night out in Magaluf, Majorca. Kaylie, 32, says that she was not romantically involved with Daniel and that she just had the tattoo done spontaneously, while she was drunk. She and her four girlfriends were out one night at the party island, and bumped onto a group of English guys on a stag weekend, who were dressed as babies, with nappies and dummies. There was a tattoo studio nearby and the then-22-year-old girl decided to get a tattoo. She said: “I am a bit of party animal and I was just having a fun time with my friends.” She started chatting with Daniel, who suggested that she gets a tattoo of his name on her bum, and Kaylie agreed as long as he would pay for it. Kaylie said: “At first I thought he was joking. It was so random” So, Kaylie had the tattoo done, for which Daniel then paid about €30. Kaylie describes how she woke up the next morning to see the tattoo and realised Daniel was staying at the same hotel as she, but he was leaving this day to return to Cardiff. She said: "It was not a holiday romance type of thing. The tattoo was simply a 'yes, let's go for it.' "I don't regret my tattoo at all. I will never get rid of it either. It is a nice little reminder of our girls trip away. My partner at the time just used to laugh it off. Kaylie is now trying to track down Daniel, whom she hasn’t seen ever since, to meet him and “see what he’s like”.
