Rory McIlroy had a moment to forget during his final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill on Sunday, as he snapped his golf club in an unusual fit of rage.  With his hopes of challenging all over, McIlroy reached boiling point on the 12th hole and decided to take it out on his wedge. The 32-year-old cut a frustrated figure over the weekend and complained about the set-up of the tournament, which only attracted four of the world's top ten players, despite prize money on offer of nearly £10 million. Following the tournament’s conclusion, McIlroy voiced his displeasure with the course, where he struggled to find his best form. "I feel punch drunk, to be honest," he fumed after his final round at Bay Hill. "The weekend, it's like crazy golf. You just don't get rewarded for good shots.

"The Players is such a big event - a $20million purse. "The four majors are sacred in this game, but The Players is very close to being among them and players don't want to feel like they’ve been beat up going there. "I’m certainly having a day off to get over it." The golf star finished on one over par at Bay Hill, placing tied 13th.  American Scottie Scheffler, who made his Ryder Cup debut last year at Whistling Strairs, went on to reign supreme at the Arnold Palmer Invitational - which was his second victory in three weeks. Last month Scheffler won the WM Phoenix Open on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff against Patrick Cantlay. The 25-year-old is one of those participating in the Players Championship starting on Thursday.
