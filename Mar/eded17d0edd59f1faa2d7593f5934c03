The Prime Minister says he believes nuclear power is “absolutely crucial” to boost the UK’s self-reliance as the country turns its back on Russian hydrocarbons and foreign fossil fuels. Mr Johnson is finalising the details of a new energy security strategy, which could be published as early as tomorrow. Today’s round table at Downing Street is the latest with industry experts in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. Nuclear power currently accounts for around 15 percent of the UK’s electricity generation. Industry leaders are expected to discuss how to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply. Mr Johnson told activists at his party’s spring conference in Blackpool, on Saturday, that the Government was going to place some “big bets on nuclear power”, including on backing small modular reactors as well as larger projects. Downing Street said nuclear is a “safe, clean and reliable energy source”. Mr Johnson will also meet chief executives from the wind sector in the next few days.
