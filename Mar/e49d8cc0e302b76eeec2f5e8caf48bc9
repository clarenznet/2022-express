As the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its second month, the French President again rejected President Zelensky's calls for weapons such as tanks. Reflecting on France's reluctance to help, Mr Zelensky told the Economist: "[It is] because they are afraid of Russia. And that's it. And those who say it first are the first to be afraid." The criticism comes as Ukraine hits a key turning point in peace negotiations with Russia, with Kyiv ready to discuss security guarantees, neutrality and non-nuclear status. Mr Zelensky added: "To be honest, Johnson is a leader who is helping more. The leaders of countries react according to how their constituents act. In this case, Johnson is an example."
