I’m determined for the UK to play an active role in responding to the serious medical needs of Ukrainians and I’ve been in regular contact with my counterparts in Ukraine and neighbouring countries to get a clear sense of what’s needed on the ground. I’m proud of how every part of the UK has already stepped up with medical support, with supplies coming from NHS England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Together, we’ve provided over two million items of medical supplies to the region in just three weeks, including vital medicines and intensive care equipment. We have also delivered wound packs so the heroic Ukrainians injured by callous Russian attacks can receive lifesaving treatment. Our support is not limited to shipments: on Sunday, we flew 21 children with cancer to the UK, where they’re now receiving life-saving treatment from the incredible NHS. I’m so grateful to all the NHS staff who have helped make this happen and the brave Ukrainian families who have made the journey to the UK. What we do in government is simply a reflection of the innate generosity of the British people, which has been on bold display in recent days. Over 150,000 people have registered their interest in housing Ukrainian refugees, and it’s been heart-warming to hear stories of people rearranging their homes and reassessing their living arrangements. And in an inspiring demonstration of the British people’s kindness, they donated a staggering £125million to the Disasters Emergency Committee in the first week of the conflict to help them support people fleeing the terror of the conflict, with the UK government giving an additional £25million. The Ukrainian people have shown phenomenal bravery; we must continue to show them our resolve to help them. Even as we work with partners in pursuit of peace, the United Kingdom will continue to stand with Ukraine and its remarkable people at their time of need.
