The star is well-known for her life in the public eye as an actress, activist and model. Over the years, fans have loved her in Absolutely Fabulous, The New Avengers, The Wolf of Wall Street and Finding Alice. One of the things which has made Joanna so recognisable as well is her iconic blonde hair. However, in some unearthed pictures of her younger years, the iconic national treasure looks very different. In the 1960s, the star was pictured with long thick brown hair. In a series of modelling shots, she can also be seen with a thick fringe in the pictures from when she was in her 20s. Joanna Lumley's Great Cities of the World at 9pm tonight.
