However, on pure performance it is Hamilton’s worst run since Silverstone in 2009. Mercedes had suffered a poort start to the weekend with Hamilton and George Russell outside the top 10 in the third practice session.  After yesterday’s Friday practice Mercedes Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin said they “don;t have a solution” to their issues. He said: "We tried a few more experiments to understand the bouncing issue here, some which made it worse, some which helped, but we don't yet have a solution to make the problem go away. We can reduce this slightly for tomorrow as it's affecting the drivers in a few of the corners and costing time. “Compared to Bahrain, the car balance is in a better place and in terms of degradation we're quite happy with what we have seen today.Our single lap still needs a bit of work but we've got the session tomorrow to do that. Overall though, a reasonable day but clearly we still have a bit of work to do before we'll be troubling Red Bull or Ferrari."
