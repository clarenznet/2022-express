The UK entered BST last night, with 1am becoming 2am and Britons losing an hour of sleep. Clocks will remain unchanged for another seven months until GMT arrives again on October 30. But recent research shows that people would prefer the change not take place at all. In a recent poll, lighting firm 4lite found that a majority of Britons would prefer the UK stay in Daylight Savings Time. Of the 1,004 people they quizzed between March 22 and March 23, 75.8 percent said they would prefer the Government stopped changing the clocks. Only 11.6 percent of people said they would keep the practice as it is now. HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
