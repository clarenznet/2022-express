In a speech to the Conservative Party’s spring conference, the Prime Minister said Britons, like Ukrainians, had the instinct “to choose freedom” and that the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU was a “recent example”. Mr Johnson said: "I know that it's the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. I can give you a couple of famous recent examples.  "When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I don't believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. "It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself." Mr Johnson’s comparison of the fight of Ukrainians against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion has been widely condemned from all sides of the political spectrum. The EU's former chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said the comparison was "insane" and Brexit was "about undoing freedoms". He tweeted: "Johnson's comparison of the courageous fight of Ukraine with Brexit is insane… "Brexit was about undoing freedoms and leaving the EU…Ukrainians want more freedom and to join the EU!" But in response Twitter user Paul Williams hit back saying: "The EU have a funny way of showing their 'freedoms' by filling up Putin's bank account. The EU is morally bankrupt!" as he shared a Newsweek article claiming the bloc has paid Russia $16 billion for fossil fuels since the start of Ukraine war. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
