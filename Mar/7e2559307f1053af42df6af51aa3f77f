Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev, commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, died in fighting at Chornobaivka, near the southern city of Kherson. It comes amid reports of heavy losses among the Kremlin's troops, with more than 14,000 Russian soldiers said to have been killed since the start of the conflict. With analysts saying around 20 generals are leading Moscow's operations in Ukraine, five confirmed deaths mean a quarter of Putin's top men have been killed in action. Ukraineâ€™s General Staff of the Armed Forces said in a statement: "As a result of fire on the enemy by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the commander of the 8th All-Military Army of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant-General Andrey Mordvishev was killed."
