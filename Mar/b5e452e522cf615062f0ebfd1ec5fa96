In a conference call with US President Joe Biden and other world leaders, the Prime Minister agreed to maintain "wide-ranging and coordinated sanctions" on the Russian regime. Afterwards, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: "The Prime Minister underlined his horror at President Putin's use of increasingly brutal tactics in Ukraine, such as siege warfare and the targeting of civilians. "He welcomed the unity of allies standing steadfastly against Russia's reprehensible behaviour, noting how effective collective action has been in undermining Putin's war machine." French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian premier Mario Draghi also joined the call. The spokeswoman added: "The leaders affirmed their ongoing commitment to support Ukraine militarily, diplomatically and economically, equipping the democratically-elected government in Kyiv with the tools it needs to defend itself. "They also resolved to increase the pressure on Russia to halt its unprovoked invasion, including by maintaining wide-ranging and coordinated sanctions." Of Mr Johnson's plans to visit Ukraine, Tory Party chairman Oliver Dowden, speaking on LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr, said: "I think the Prime Minister is desperate to go to Ukraine and has throughout this conflict felt a real emotional connection with the suffering of the Ukrainian people." Mr Dowden said the Prime Minister, who has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky almost every day during the crisis, wanted to "see what's going on, on the ground". He added: "I should say that no decisions have been taken in relation to this." Downing Street officials say there are "no plans" for Mr Johnson to visit Ukraine.
