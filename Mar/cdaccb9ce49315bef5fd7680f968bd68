The Queen travelled to London to attend the memorial service for her beloved late husband Prince Philip. And she did so sharing a car with her second son, Prince Andrew. This is the first public event the Duke of York attends since Prince Philip's funeral last April. Commenting on the reports Prince Andrew is accompanying the monarch to London, the Daily Express royal correspondent wrote on Twitter: "It’s reported that the Queen is on her way from Windsor in a car with Prince Andrew, which puts him at the heart of the story today now." The coverage from the BBC brought short shrift from viewers with one saying it had "a side order of sourness" and another blasting its bland coverage saying: "What am I learning  of the Prince Philip service, beyond the Queen is alive and that Westminster Abbey is pretty?"
