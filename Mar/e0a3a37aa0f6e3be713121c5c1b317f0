Six-year-old Joe and eight-year-old Zac, both Alaskan Malamutes, came into the RSPCA's care in April 2021. They were two of 20 dogs rescued from a site in Wales and it is thought they had never lived inside before. Joe and Zac are "bewildered and confused" when they arrived at the RSPCA's Birmingham Animal Centre. They had to be carried to their kennels as they did not know how to walk on the lead and had not worn collars before. Nearly a year later, the bonded pair have come on leaps and bounds but are still waiting for the right adopters to come along. The cantre's kennel supervisor Kelly Legg said: “Their coats were incredibly filthy and matted when they first came into us. "We don’t believe they’d ever had a bath or been brushed. "Both dogs were bewildered and confused. "They were incredibly shut down and didn’t want to move. "We had to carry them from the inspector’s van to their kennel because they had no idea how to walk on a lead and had never even seen a collar before.
