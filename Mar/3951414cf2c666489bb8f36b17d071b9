Marc Marquez suffered a nasty crash during the warm-up for the Indonsian Grand Prix on Sunday morning. The eight-time world champion was preparing for the start of the race before being launched into the air at Turn 7 after a terrifying highside. Marquez dipped into the turn before his back end slipped away from him, bouncing into the air to send the rider flying. The 29-year-old went sliding off into the gravel trap before coming to a halt with his bike smashed into pieces. BT Sport commentator Gavin Emmett said on commentary: "That's a shocking crash for Marc Marquez. That's one of the biggest high-sides I've seen in 25 years covering this sport. He must have been 12 to 15 feet in the air the Repsol Honda man." Incredibly, Marquez was able to walk away from the crash but he was seen stumbling his way to the barriers. He was taken to a local hospital for checks where it was confirmed that he had suffered a concussion. MotoGP confirmed that Marquez would not be fit enough to compete in the race, but that he would be aiming to be 'fully fit for the Grand Prix of Argentina'. Dr Angel Charte said: “Marc is fine. He had a high energy crash in the Warm Up, which resulted in a head injury. "Initially, we examined him here and then referred him to the hospital in Lombok. He underwent several radiological tests, which were negative. In agreement with the rider and the team, and due to the fact that this type of pathology requires a period of observation between 12 and 24 hours, the rider, the team and the MotoGP medical staff have decided to declare him as unfit.” Repsol Honda team manager Alberto Puig has called for an investigation into the tyres being used by Michelin. "It's been strange because Marc had three big crashes and we have to understand why," he said. "The crash today was brutal. We need to anaylse. They [Michelin] brought a different tyre here and we need to understand everything. Our rider crashed and we want to understand [why]."
