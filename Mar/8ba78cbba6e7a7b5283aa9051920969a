Reid erupted at the Colchester MP after he told Good Morning Britain viewers Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not fail to set up support where necessary for the most disadvantaged people in the country. The ITV host interrupted at the Conservative politician mid-sentence to remind him he "took away" £1,000 a year away from people on Universal Credit. Quince said there were three ways the Government could support funding, which were to cut services, raise taxes or borrow money.Referring to when he was Minister of State for the Department for Work and Pensions, Quince said: "The Chancellor and Prime Minister did not fail at any point to step up and support where necessary the poorest, most disadvantaged in our country."Reid furiously interjected: "Sorry Mr Quince, but you took £1,000 away a year from people on Universal Credit - how is that helping?"

However, Quince explained that was put in place as a "targeted measure" during the coronavirus pandemic.As he was answering the question, Reid cut him off again to add: "I don't know if you have noticed Mr Quince but inflation is now at its highest in 30 years, you also haven't raised benefits in line with inflation."She fumed: "It is disingenuous to say you are helping those at the poorest end."The pair were continuing to talk over each other as the debate on the topic escalated.
