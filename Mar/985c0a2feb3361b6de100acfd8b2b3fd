Last week's mild spell gave way to sleet and snow, and temperatures have sunk to -8C (18F) in Scotland. Homes in Durham were blanketed yesterday but daffodils managed to pierce the wintery conditions at a cottage near Stanhope. Coast-to-coast cyclist Terry Smith, 57, from Coventry, was forced to get off his bike at Allenheads, Northumberland.  But the chill did not deter a brave swimmer at the Hotwalls in Portsmouth. The Met Office's Steve Willington said: "Some clear spells are still around later in the week, with the best of any sunshine in the south and west of the UK, albeit feeling cold." But it will be a balmy 57F (14C) from Monday in the north and in the south from the middle of next week. Meanwhile, a geomagnetic storm warning has been issued over 17 solar flares from a single sun spot. People as far south as southern Scotland and Northern Ireland may see the Northern Lights, said the Met Office.
