The bloc is claiming it harms its suppliers when the UK awards subsidies for offshore wind projects that favour those using turbines sourced domestically over imports. The European Commission has claimed this is in breach of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The UK’s contracts for difference scheme gives financial aid to climate-friendly energy projects, in practice mostly offshore wind farms, in a bidding process. But the bloc claims this is unfair - not giving the chance for imported stock to be used within the UK. It is the first WTO dispute since the UK left the EU, and is a serious escalation in tensions between the two, with the UK saying it will “rigorously contest” the claim. The new case comes as both sides remain mired in talks over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. So, do you think the case brought by the EU is a case of Brexit revenge? Or a legitimate concern that could harm the EU? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
