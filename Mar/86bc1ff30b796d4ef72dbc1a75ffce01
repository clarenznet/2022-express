Well, no wonder! She’s 6ft 3ins tall and, having gone through puberty as a man, she has stronger muscles, larger lungs, bigger hands and a longer reach than any of the biological women she now races against. And the biology here is clear –  women are defined by their XX chromosomes and men by their XY ones. Lia Thomas has XY  chromosomes and so is a biological man. Not only is that hideously unfair to the women in that event, it’s outrageous that it was ever allowed to happen.  When she was competing against men she was not good enough to win national titles. Now the swimmer, who still has male genitalia, is up against women and it’s victory all the way.  Thanks to these governing bodies, technically, Thomas isn’t doing anything wrong.  But doesn’t her conscience, her sense of fairness, tell her she is? Isn’t sport about fair competition?  There’s no middle ground. You either agree with everything they say and want – or you’re a transphobe whose opinion has to be destroyed.
