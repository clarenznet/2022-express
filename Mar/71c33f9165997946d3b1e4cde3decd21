Food, clothes and water are stacked up inside the glass-fronted outlets. And there are camp beds everywhere. The centre is one of 26 buildings that have been converted into refugee reception centres by the Polish government since Russia invaded Ukraine last Thursday. Since then more than 660,000 people have fled the war-torn country, including nearly 400,000 into Poland. Officials here estimate there are 250,000 more waiting to get through as the conflict escalates and the refugee crisis deepens. Refugees are also crossing the borders to neighbouring countries to the west, including Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova, and experts predict up to five million may end up being displaced. Among those at the shopping centre yesterday was mother-of-two Ganna Solomko and her daughter Ruslana, 18. Ganna, who works in the oil industry, fled her home in Odessa two days before the war started, leaving her son Alexii, 27, and her husband behind, in order to travel to Lviv to be with Ruslana, who is studying there. Ganna said: "Since arriving here in Poland there have been people to help us at every turn. "The attitude towards us has been so amazing I could cry. They are so warm and we are so thankful." Anastacia, 28, from Kyiv, rocked her two-month-old daughter Eve in her arms and watched over her son Mykola, five. The English teacher, said: "My husband works as an engineer and has been offered jobs abroad before, but we are patriots and love our country, soÂ would never have left except for war. I hope we will be able to go home, but I don't believe it will be soon."
