Fortnite Season 2 kicked off earlier this week, adding new vehicles, items, weapons and Battle Pass rewards. But just a few days into the season, Epic has released its first maintenance patch, which is available to download right now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. If you're wondering what's new in Fortnite update 3.50, then read on for the patch notes. As you can see from the maintenance patch notes below, the update addresses stability issues on consoles. There's a specific fix for Xbox consoles, as Epic Games fixes the issue with Xbox players using the mouse and keyboard. The new update also coincides with the launch of the Armoured Battle Bus, which can be found atÂ The Sanctuary and Synapse Station. "We've just released a maintenance patch on PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch consoles to address stability issues," reads an Epic tweet. "You will be able to download the patch before launching your game. "The Issue when Xbox players using Keyboard and Mouse may stop moving when pressing a mouse button has been resolved. "The Armored Battle Bus is fully constructed and ready to roll at The Sanctuary and Synapse Station!" Epic adds. "Be sure to thank your bus driver." The new Fortnite season is titled Resistance, and centres around the battle between the IO and The Seven. Dr Strange headlines the new Battle Pass, alongside seven other new skins, including The Prowler from Spider-Man. Tanks have also been added to the game, as well as Siege Cannons, IO Blimps, and a Cow Catcher for vehicles. New gameplay features include sprinting, parkour moves and even shoulder charges.
