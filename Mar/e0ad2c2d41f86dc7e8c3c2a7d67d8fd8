Jamie Carragher did not hold back in his assessment of Paris Saint-Germain's schoolboy defending for Real Madrid's third goal during Wednesday evening's Champions League clash between the two sides. The Spanish giants successfully managed to overturn a 2-0 aggregate deficit to progress to this season's quarter-finals with an impressive 3-1 win on a memorable night under the lights at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid went into the match knowing they would need at least two goals to book their place in the last eight after falling to Kylian Mbappe's late winner in last month's reverse fixture at the Parc des Princes.The Frenchman rekindled his goalscoring form once again to find the back of the net shortly before half-time and put PSG in the ascendancy at the break.However, the visitors were undone by an inspired display from Real Madrid veteran Karim Benzema, who produced a remarkable second-half hat-trick to keep Real Madrid's hopes of European glory alive and kicking.He chipped in with three quick-fire goals in a 17-minute period to cap off a stunning turnaround and condemn PSG to yet another season without a continental title.Benzema was ultimately given far too much room to strut his stuff during the closing stages of the match and Carragher pulled no punches as he ran the rule over PSG's defending for the 34-year-old's third goal.

This is absolutely disgraceful, it really is."Players at this level where they've just got to dig in now and fight, they really have. It's obviously a difficult position, they've just conceded two goals."To do that straight from a kick-off is absolutely embarrassing." Carragher's comments were quickly echoed by Thierry Henry, who slammed Marquinhos for giving the ball straight to Benzema inside the area."Marquinhos does these types of mistakes and he did it a lot in the game," added Henry."Instead of clearing the ball he tried to play and pass the ball to [Presnel] Kimpembe, but Benzema was alert and arrived there before him."Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether Mauricio Pochettino will eventually be relieved of his managerial duties by PSG in the wake of their latest European setback.

You have to give Real credit because even when they are down they stay in the game."We have seen managers come and go and they cannot sort it out. They come, they get knocked out of the Champions League and get sacked and then move on."
