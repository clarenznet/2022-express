Jude Bellingham may put off the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool with his recent behaviour at Borussia Dortmund. Bellingham is widely touted as one of the brightest young talents in Europe. But the midfielder has been told he has "gone way too far" with his outbursts at team-mates of late. Bellingham opted to join Dortmund over the likes of United in January 2020. He doesn't turn 19 until June but has already made 80 appearances for the German outfit. The former Birmingham City ace has started 22 of Dortmund's 24 Bundesliga matches this season. And despite Bellingham's young age, he clearly feels comfortable around more experienced players.

German outlet Sport1 report the midfielder saying to Schulz: “You can’t get one f****** pass off, you’re f******* s***. Every f****** time!” Despite the furious outburst, Dortmund boss Marco Rose was not unhappy with his player. Speaking to the press, Rose said: “Where Jude comes from, you possibly speak a bit more rough in English.

Jude wants to win games, he’s angry – and that’s part of him as a player and something we actually need even more.” However, it has since emerged another incident involving Bellingham has taken place. Dortmund drew 1-1 at Augsburg last Sunday to put a huge dent in their slight hopes of catching Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga. Bellingham was seen reacting angrily to midfield partner Axel Witsel.  Sport1 claims Bellingham took exception to Witsel attempting to correct his forward movement. That type of behaviour is unlikely to be music to the ears of the likes of United or Liverpool. Both Premier League giants hold an interest in the player, whose contract at Dortmund expires in 2025. But he may have to change his demeanour in order to attract the big offers Dortmund would demand. Sport1 reporter Patrick Berger claims Bellingham creates a divide in the dressing room with his antics.  “That’s going way too far,” Berger said. “He splits the room with his behaviour. “That doesn’t go down well with the team. With his demeanour, he’s starting to annoy even the experienced players. “This is a delicate situation. He performs, but on the other hand an 18-year-old has to rein himself in. “There is also the question of who will intervene in the dressing room. That is currently missing.”  Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport? Join our brand new Facebook group by clicking here
