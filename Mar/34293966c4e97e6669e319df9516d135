Rosario Central's derby with Newell's Old Boys in Argentina was delayed after supporters detonated live grenades on the field of play ahead of kick-off. The match - labelled the Superclasico in South America - is widely renowned for its fiery, passionate atmosphere.  Fans of Newell's, who have made it tradition to give their side a big send off before the match, held a pyro party to spur their players on ahead of the meeting. Around 30,000 fanatics were in attendance at the Estadio Marcelo Bielsa in a bid to drive the team towards victory in one of their most important matches of the season. Ultras even climbed the fences of the ground to be part of the spine-tingling atmosphere at the open training session. Newell's are currently sixth in the table while Rosario are down in ninth. The Rosario fans, known as the Canallas, dressed up in their numbers to create a unique and special atmosphere. But there were concerning scenes prior to kick-off when a live grenade was thrown onto the field of play before exploding into the turf. Video footage has since gone viral of the grenade landing on the turf before blowing up. There was significant markings on the grass too and the shockwaves from the explosion could be felt during the video.  The official Newell's Twitter account tweeted: "Teams are on the pitch. A few bombs are thrown onto the pitch and explode as the teams lineup for their photos. There is now smoke filling one of the penalty boxes." Before adding: "The referee was briefed by the Head of Security following the incident." Thankfully, nobody was injured during the incident and the match was given the green light to go ahead, despite the holes blown in the turf. The groundsmen were quick to patch over the grass at the crime scene, making sure the pitch was still fit for purpose. Newell's would eventually go on to win the clash 1-0 thanks to Juan Manuel Garcia's 51st-minute goal.
