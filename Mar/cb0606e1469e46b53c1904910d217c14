Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have resided in sunny California since 'Megxit', but the Sussexes had initially hoped to continue supporting the Queen and their royal patronages after stepping down as senior working royals. And it seems Harry and Meghan could still be hoping for a triumphant UK return in the future, according to royal author Tom Quinn, who told the To Di For Daily podcast: “One interesting thing an insider told me… is that both Meghan and Harry believe that when the elder royals die – in other words, Elizabeth – they may well be able when Charles is King, be able to come back and be the part-time royals that they really wanted to be.  “So that they would be six months [as] working royals and six months in the States or wherever doing their own thing. “That was something that Queen Elizabeth absolutely said couldn’t happen, but I think Meghan and Harry are hoping that Charles, Harry's father after all, will be more of a moderniser and will say to them, ‘okay, if you want to be part-time royals, that’s fine’." So should Harry and Meghan be allowed to come back to the UK as part-time working royals, or has the ship sailed for the Duke and Duchess?
