Once dubbed a "Tory feminist", Baroness Howe of Idlicote was the widow of Lord Howe, a former Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor, who died in 2015. She died on Tuesday at her home in Warwickshire. Her family said she had fought a "brave battle with cancer".  Lord Howe was fundamental in the making of Mrs Thatcher but his decision to quit as her deputy due to a "conflict of loyalties" in 1990 is said to have brought on her resignation three weeks later. Lady Howe was the half-sister of the Duchess of Cornwall's father Major Bruce Shand. Camilla said the death of her aunt Lady Howe was "a sad time for all the family". Baroness Howe was memorably described as becoming "once, twice, three times a lady" as she had become a Lady through her marriage to Lord Howe, who was then Sir Geoffrey. She retained her title when he was elevated to the Lords but she was then made a crossbench peer in her own right in 2001. She retired from politics in 2020. From 1975 to 1979, she was deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission and then became chair of the Broadcasting Standards Commission. In a profile of Lady Howe in 1993, she was called a "Tory feminist" and had many well-documented clashes with Baroness Thatcher. It led Tory grandee John Biffen to once say that the two women behaved like "wasps in a jam jar".
