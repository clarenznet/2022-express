The Chelsea Football Club owner's £330 million superyacht has reportedly set sail from a Dutch island in the Caribbean towards international waters. On Thursday, tracking data shows the yacht left Simpson Bay on the Dutch side of St Maarten. The superyacht's movements come after world leaders move to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs.  Mr Abramovich's vessel left the island of St Maarten in the Leeward Islands. The yacht set sail just hours after authorities took control of two other yachts owned by close allies of Russia's president Vladimir Putin. The 55-year-old billionaire’s yacht is called the Eclipse. It is the second biggest yacht in the world at 162m (531ft).   The US has said it was putting together a task force to “hunt down” and freeze the assets of Russian oligarchs. This includes yachts, describing them as “ill-gotten gains”. Mr Abramovich's yacht was delivered to him in 2010. It has two swimming pools, two helicopter pads and a miniature submarine.

The billionaire has another superyacht, called Solaris. It is valued at £357million and is docked in Barcelona reportedly undergoing a refit. Mr Abramovich is busy selling his Western assets before his property is seized. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the Government to add the Russian to its list of sanctioned oligarchs. Meanwhile, he has put Chelsea up for sale for a price tag of £3 billion. He said this was in “the best interests of the club” amid mounting pressure over his links with Putin. Mr Abramovich is worth an estimated £9.2 billion.
