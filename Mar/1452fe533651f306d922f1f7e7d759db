About 13 caravans and associated vehicles were pictured yesterday in Sutton Park, a national nature reserve in the West Midlands. A fence beside the field was seen broken by alarmed ramblers. Around six caravans pitched up at Sutton Park three weeks ago. reports Birmingham Live. The council helped remove that group but have already had complaints about the second trespassers. Councillor David Pears, who represents Sutton Trinity ward for Birmingham City Council, said: "I was notified of their arrival and went to Sutton Park at around 9am on Sunday morning. "I was also in contact with the officer who deals with this for Birmingham City Council. They are on Meadow Platt. I have had reports from residents in Tudor Hill and Park Road regarding fighting at Meadow Platt. I have had a series of complaints. "I arrived this morning (Sunday) there was one police car and then two more arrived. When I looked at the vehicles there are considerably more of them than last time, some looked similar to the last group, but I cannot be sure they are the same. "They have had a notice served on them on Sunday asking them to leave. I would hope it would be by Tuesday or Wednesday they will be on their way and gone."  The nearest official travellers site, in neighbouring Birmingham, is closed for repairs. It's believed travellers have occupied the beauty spot, popular with hikers, as a result. But Cllr Pears called the behaviour "unacceptable". He continued: "This is unacceptable and is my main concern. We have enough to contend with protecting the park. I admire the due diligence and work of the officers dealing with it. "It is a worry. How long are we going to have to put up with it this year?"
