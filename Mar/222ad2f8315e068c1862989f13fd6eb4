Emma Raducanu could well need the help of fellow British star Andy Murray once more, following a disappointing exit at this week’s Indian Wells Masters. Raducanu was dumped out of the tournament at the round of 32 stage after falling to a 2-1 defeat to Croatia’s Petra Martić. The 19-year-old - who has endured a somewhat underwhelming run since becoming US Open champion - got off to the perfect start in California after winning the opening set via a tie break. Her opponent Martić however responded well, as she came back to win the second set 6-4 to level things up at 1-1. A tense deciding set then followed, and Raducanu left herself on the cusp of victory after breaking serve late on to put her 5-4 up in the third set and one game away from the last 16. JUST IN: Emma Raducanu dumped out of Indian Wells following last 32 defeat to Petra Martic  “I knew he came through some tricky moments. I was thinking the same when I dropped the second set. “I was like, 'you can do the same, just keep pushing'. It's always like a weird one when you're following someone who has just won. “You really want to do the same. It kind of gives you the extra fuel. He gave me like a fist bump, it was really cool. “He has been supportive, for sure. One time when I was just practising, I managed to hit with him. I was so nervous. I was moving my feet so fast just to try and keep up  “I think he's just such a great role model for me and everyone from the UK, and also across the world. 700 wins is something I can just dream of.” Following her disappointment against Martić it seems that the US Open champion could well once again require this Murray inspiration, when she dusts herself down and makes her return to the court. And this return is right around the corner, with her schedule now taking her to next week’s Miami Open.
