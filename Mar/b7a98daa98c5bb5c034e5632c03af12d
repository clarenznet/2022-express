Speaking at the launch of Subway’s first pop-up restaurant aboard a yacht in central London, he said: “I think about this every day, should I do the lottery? “If I won more than a million, I’d buy myself a safari park and I’d drive my Jeep round and retire there. I’d drink beer and watch the lions.” Sam, younger brother of MIC regular Louise Thompson, was speaking about his retirement plans aboard “The Subway” yacht, before it opens to the public this week. The floating pop-up restaurant will open to the public for two days, offering a VIP experience supposedly akin to what the jet-set would enjoy in St Tropez and Ibiza. Guests will be greeted by the captain with a glass of bubbly, complimentary shades and hot towels on arrival, while a live DJ spins Ibiza chill-out tunes on deck. The restaurant chain created the luxury pop-up to launch their “Meal Deal Millionaire” prize draw, where guests who purchase a Meal Deal at stores until 29th March have the chance to win one million Subway Rewards points. This is the equivalent of 1,000 Footlong Subs - to redeem against the lunchtime favourite’s subs, wraps, salads, sides and hot drinks. Sam Thompson also discussed his “bromance” with fellow TikTok prankster Pete Wicks - and revealed some of the tricks he’s tried to get away with. Sam said: “I‘ve tried to prank him. He’s a vegetarian and I’ve tried to prank him with meat before and he gets angry. “I put some Peperami in his beer once and it didn’t go down well. “Pete maintains we’re not friends, but you have to be friends first. I think we’re brothers, and he thinks we’re acquaintances. “He actually does love me. He just says he doesn’t to maintain his cool image. “When we speak on the phone, I make him say “love you” at the end and sometimes he does.” To book a VIP meal on “The Subway” yacht, visit here.
