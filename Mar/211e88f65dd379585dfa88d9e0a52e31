Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Transpennine route upgrade, the Integrated Rail Plan and Northern Powerhouse Rail schemes would "transform the lives of passengers across the region for generations to come". He added: "As we level up, we're determined to use rail to boost local economies, create greener journeys and change lives." Rail minister Wendy Morton will announce a package of infrastructure upgrades today that will "transform" the day-to-day journeys of train passengers in the North-west region over the next decade. Work has already begun with upgrades to track-side equipment between Manchester and Liverpool and platform extensions on the Cumbrian route, which will allow for longer trains.
