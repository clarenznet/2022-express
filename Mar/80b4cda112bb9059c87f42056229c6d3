Gary Neville has given a damning verdict on Tottenham's star duo Harry Kane and Heung-min Son following their loss to Manchester United. Tottenham suffered a 3-2 defeat to United at Old Trafford, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a stunning hat-trick. The loss puts a huge dent in Spurs' hopes of finishing in the Premier League top four. Tottenham drew level twice but Ronaldo's late header condemned Antonio Conte's side to defeat. Neville was critical of Spurs' wing-backs Matt Doherty and Sergio Reguilon after the match. But he then singled out Kane and Son for criticism, saying they were particularly poor after Harry Maguire's own goal drew the game level at 2-2. Neville said on Sky Sports: "I've just dug out their wing-backs there but it's worth mentioning in the last 25 minutes the two best players.

About five, six times in that last 20 minutes. So they were really poor. "After Spurs got back in the game at 2-2, those two players really should have gone on and won the game for Spurs but they were poor. "They had the worst period in the game, Son and Kane, in that last part. "So that was disappointing as well for Conte. I'm sure he'll look back and think I expect more from you."
