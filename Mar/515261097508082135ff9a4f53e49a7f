Max Verstappen has attacked Red Bull’s strategy as he struggled to pass Charles Leclerc in the Bahrain Grand Prix. Verstappen pitted a lap earlier than the Ferrari to get to within a second of Leclerc on two separate occasions.  However, Verstappen felt he could have taken the lead if he was allowed to push on his outlap. He said: “This is now two times that I've taken it easy on the out laps when I could have easily taken the lead," says Verstappen on team radio. I'm never ever doing it again." Martin Brundle said Verstappen was “angry in that car” after Verstappen’s heated outburst.   Ted Kravitz said he would be looking into how much slower Verstappen was going on his two outlaps. He said it was possible Red Bull would tell Verstappen he would not have been able to pass Leclerc even if he had pushed. Since the pitstop phase, Verstappen has been unable to close in on Leclerc. The two enjoyed a fierce battle in the early stages with Leclerc just edging it out. Vertasappen ran wide at Turn One and locked up his front tyres which may have contributed to hos slightly tainted pace. Before the race, Verstappen believes his team had built a strong race car”.

The Ferraris are of course very close and it’s going to be a tough battle, they have two strong drivers so it’s going to be exciting.”
