Shane Malpass, spokesperson for We Buy Any Motorcaravan said there would one day be a “gradual depreciation” in costs but warned this was not likely in the foreseeable future. He added new motorhome costs were “increasing in value” every year which was pushing up prices across the board. Mr Malpass said: “There may be some gradual depreciation in years to come, but for the next few years, probably not. “Why? Because every year, new motorhomes increase in value. “This means that the user maintains its price so it falls in line with the new prices. “For example, a brand new Swift Escape 674 was £56,450 in 2021 and the used price on a forecourt was around £47,950.

No! “There is just no way that there will be a near £20,000 gap between new and used. “Therefore, if you managed to get hold of a Swift Escape in 2021, you probably could get your money back in 2022 in a private sale.” Mr Malpass added there were still “floods” of first-time buyers desperate to get onto the market.

He added: “Some dealers who usually stock 20, 30, 40 motorhomes, are down to as little as two or three for sale. “There is even one chain of 13 branches, which is down to 38 total stock. That's averaging 2.92 per branch! “With new motorhomes in short supply, this is going to be very difficult to improve on.”  Caravans and motorhome demand has surged in recent years as staycation holidays become more popular in the coronavirus pandemic. Experts at The CaravanPlace warned earlier this year average prices had jumped by up to £700 on models. They warned there would not be a “huge amount” of new caravans produced in 2022 as many had already sold out. WeBuyAnyMotorcaravan has previously warned some models were up by around £15,000 in some cases.  Semi-conductor issues were a “big factor” in the shortage while some manufacturers were facing increased material costs. Last year, British Car Auctions (BCA) said one driver had paid over £97,000 for a motorhome. Meanwhile, another had spent £85,000 for a Swift Kon Tiki motorhome in a massive purchase.
