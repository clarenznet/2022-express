The long-forgotten Distinguished Flying Cross belonged to Pilot Officer Roy Jack Hubert Hussey. But his grandson failed to realise its importance and planned to bin it before taking it with other finds to East Bristol Auctions. Auctioneer Andrew Stowe said: "As he laid the items out I caught sight of a box that had 'DFC' on top. "My heart skipped. I tentatively opened it up and there it was. The gentleman knew it belonged to his grandfather, but no details. If we hadn't spotted it, his next stop was to throw it away." Plt Off Hussey, of Mangotsfield, Bristol, joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve underage. He shot down 15 enemy aircraft and took part in 230 sorties. He was killed on February 20, 1945, three days before his 22nd birthday, when his Mustang KH440 crash landed. His DFC - one of the highest awards a pilot can be given - could fetch more than Â£5,000 when it goes under the hammer on March 21 in an online-only auction alongside Plt Off Hussey's wings and log books.
