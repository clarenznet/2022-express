Honeysuckle, saddled by Rachel Blackmore, will look to extend her 14-race unbeaten run when she runs in the Champion Hurdle (3.30pm) on Day One of the Cheltenham Festival today. However, the superstar mare faces stiff competition from Patrick Mullins' Appreciate It. When asked if today will be the biggest test of her career today, the horse's trainer Henry De Bromhead said: "Maybe it is, I don't know, but every time you run in a Grade 1 it's a tough test if you ask me. "Obviously Appreciate It is very good and it sounds like they are happier than ever with Epatante too, so she will be asked plenty of questions. Let's see if she has the answers." And on Honeysuckle's form, he added: "She seems really well in herself. She's actually in mighty form and everything has gone great since you saw her last. It's all very positive."
