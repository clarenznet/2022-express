Andrea Bocelli showed no sign of stopping during the pandemic; finding ways to perform in whatever ways he could. Along with releasing his Believe album, the Italian tenor has since put out the 10th anniversary remastered version of his Concerto: One Night In Central Park record. Back in 2011, the maestro performed accompanied by the Westminster Symphonic Choir and New York Philharmonic Orchestra to over 70,000 people on the great lawn. One of the special concert’s highlights had to be singing his rendition of Nessun dorma!, which Bocelli has shared the climax of on his Instagram page. The star was met with thunderous applause as he belted out that final note to an audience that included then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and future President Donald Trump. Nessun dorma!, which means “Let no one sleep” is an aria from the final act of Giacomo Puccini’s opera Turandot. It is performed by the unknown prince character Calaf who falls in love at first sight with the Princess Turandot.

Nessun dorma! is the prince’s assertion that he will indeed triumph and wed the princess. The piece was popularised in modern times by Pavarotti, when he performed the aria for the 1990 World Cup. Reaching No 2 in the UK, he would go on to perform it with the Three Tenors at the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cup finals.
