The man was battered senseless after allegedly failing to bring a gas analyser used in boiler exhausts to an operation in Muirhouse, Edinburgh. Although the attack was caught on camera, police say "no complaint" was made about the violence. It's alleged the victim was sacked after the attack, which happened on March 4 on a housing estate. In the footage, the hooded victim is asked: "Where is it?" and "Where’s the boy’s analyser?" "No more f*****g, you dafty, where’s the analyser?" The man is then punched and kicked repeatedly in the footage, which Express.co.uk has deemed too distressing to publish. Police said they were given "no information" by people they traced after witnessing the footage, reports Edinburgh Live today. It is understood the gas engineer is recovering from his injuries. Further information about the job in question is limited at this stage. It comes days after senseless youths repeatedly assaulted a man and then reversed their car into his - just because he had challenged them over "queue jumping" in a newsagents mear Smethwick, West Midlands. The 38-year-old victim was left bruised after the beating. He had made a remark to one of the teenagers after they darted to the front of the queue in the shop in the suburb, but was confronted by the rest of the gang outside. The dad refused to apologise for his comment and he claimed punches started "flying all over the place" as he walked to his car.
