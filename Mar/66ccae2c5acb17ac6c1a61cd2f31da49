Non-profit organisation Polskie Merseyside has been flooded with supplies after making an appeal. Toiletries, underwear, sanitary products and even shoes are being collected for Ukrainians fleeing the bombardment. Michael Frackowiak, the charity's Polish founder, said: "We are giving people a platform to donate."Ava Clark, an eight-year-old from Cleethorpes, Lincs, cycled across the Humber Bridge 10 times. She covered almost 14 miles to raise money for humanitarian aid organisation Unicef to support families in Ukraine. Dad John Clark, 30, said: "She saw the news and asked us how she could help. We're very proud."
