 MasterChef fans tuned in to see a new series of the BBC cooking show begin on Wednesday night. However, as the show began, hosts John Torode and Gregg Wallace revealed they were shaking-up the format for the new series. The culinary duo explained the contestants would be taking part in a brand new audition round. However, many viewers weren’t pleased with the change and took to Twitter to complain.    Co-hosts John and Gregg welcomed the fresh contestants into the MasterChef kitchen before revealing the format change. John announced: “This year we’re changing things up a bit. This is an audition round! “You’ve all brought along your own ingredients and we’ve asked you to cook your signature dish. “However, you’ll be serving us in the brand new tasting room which means that we will not be in here watching you cook.

He explained: “When we’ve tasted all the dishes John and I will choose our three favourites. Those three top cooks will grab an apron straight away. “The remaining six will get the chance to cook again for four remaining aprons,” Gregg added.   “We look forward to something truly delicious,” John said, before leaving the contestants to begin cooking. After watching the hosts explain the new audition round, viewers took to Twitter to share their thoughts. However, many weren’t pleased with the format change, insisting the show didn’t need to be altered. @Nickel_Wound wrote: “I do not like change #masterchef.” “I'm already confused #MasterChef," @SteveERobinson2 commented.

Meanwhile, other viewers embraced the change with some recognising the audition round had been taken from the Australian and American versions of the show. @helen_a15 enthused: "Oooh a format change! #Masterchef #MasterchefUK.” “So pleased @MasterChefUK is following in the footsteps of @masterchefau at last with an audition round. Australia's had this right for years! #Masterchef #MasterchefUK #MasterchefAustralia," @dizzytiggy said.   This is the eighteenth series of MasterChef UK and will take place over the course of seven weeks. Over the coming weeks 45 hopefuls will battle it out in the kitchen as they try their best to impress judges John and Gregg. By the end of the series one contestant will be crowned this year’s MasterChef Champion. MasterChef continues Friday at 8pm on BBC One.
