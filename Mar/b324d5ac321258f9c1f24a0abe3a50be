The Wildlife and Cornfield mixes are perfect for starting a wildlife garden or using as charming border plants, whilst also being a great source of food and habitat for wildlife (attracting Butterflies and Bees). Furthermore, the Lettuce Salad Bowl seeds will become ‘baby leaves’ or ‘loose leaf’ lettuces with an attractive red-tinged or green oak leaf shape, the core of any great salad. And accompany this with the masses of sweet and tangy, large 'cherry' Tomatoes which even though technically a fruit, are Britain's favourite summer vegetable! Regardless of your gardening experience, all the seeds are suitable for all with clear and easy planting and growing instructions to follow! So make sure you don’t miss out, pick up your weekend papers (Saturday March 26 and Sunday March 27, 2022) where you will find a voucher to cut out and take with you to your local WHSmith store to redeem the offer.
