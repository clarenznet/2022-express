Anybody who's been gaming since the 1980s will have seen plenty of iconic video game characters come and go. It started with the likes of Pac-Man, Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, and would evolve into more realistic characters such as Lara Croft, Chris Redfield and Marcus Fenix. If you fancy yourself as a bit of a gamer, then you might want to test your mettle against Express Online's latest gaming quiz. We want to know how well you know your video game characters, particularly the ones who don't have their own movies, TV shows and merchandise. And good luck getting a perfect score, because this gaming quiz is much harder than you think.
