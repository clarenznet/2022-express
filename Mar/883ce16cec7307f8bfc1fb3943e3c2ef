Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock made sure she dressed to impress on Friday as she took on the red carpet at the Top Boy 2 premiere. The 30-year-old wore a matching Diesel set consisting of a dark green mini-skirt and bomber jacket. She paired the co-ord with some black mesh heels and large gold hoop earrings. Leigh-Anne posed up a storm on the red carpet with her fierce gaze emphasised by shimmery green eyeshadow. She completed the fabulous look with an elaborate geometrical hairdo. Leigh-Anne rose to prominence in 2011 as part of the girl group Little Mix, who made history by becoming the first ever group to win the British version of the X Factor. The pop star recently became a mum after she gave birth to twins last August.
