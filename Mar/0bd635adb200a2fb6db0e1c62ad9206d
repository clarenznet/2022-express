The son of Shane actor Alan Ladd, Laddie - as he was known - gave the green light to George Lucas' original Star Wars movie, despite studio resistance and an admittance he didn't understand its vision.  The 20th Century Fox executive famously said in 1982: "I hope I can make a lot of films I'm very proud of and that 30 years from now somebody'll come to me and say, 'Gee, I just saw Star Wars and I think it's the greatest movie ever made,' or something like that." His films won more than 50 Oscars and had 150 nominations. He produced The Right Stuff, Blade Runner, Police Academy, Gone Baby Gone and Braveheart, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1996. Without his backing, there would have been no Alien, Young Frankenstein, The Rocky Horror Show or Chariots of Fire. Born in LA, California, to Alan Ladd and Marjorie Jane, he was raised by his father after his parents divorced when he was two and his mother suffered health problems.  Growing up, he immersed himself in movies and got a job as a cinema usher so he could watch Errol Flynn pictures repeatedly. After serving in the US Air Force he became a talent agent for stars such as Judy Garland, Natalie Wood, Joan Collins and Robert Redford. He relocated to London and established himself as an independent producer. In the mid-1980s, he moved to MCM and made Moonstruck, Rainman, Thelma & Louise and A Fish Called Wanda. Ladd Jr is survived by his wife, Cindra Pincock and his three children. He is said to have died of kidney failure. Alan Ladd Jr Born October 22 1937, Died March 2 2022, aged 84
