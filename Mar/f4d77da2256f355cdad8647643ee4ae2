Belarus, a close Russian ally, may soon join the Russian attack on Ukraine and is preparing to let Russia position nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil, an official has warned. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has already allowed Russia’s military to use its territory to invade Ukraine and launch attacks but has so far resisted directly joining the war. The NATO intelligence official told NBC: “The Belarusian government is preparing the environment to justify a Belarusian offensive against Ukraine and the imminent deployment of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus. I’m not telling you they’re going to put nukes in there tomorrow. What I mean is they’ve taken steps politically to now be able to receive nuclear weapons if such a decision is made.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
