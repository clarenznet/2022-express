Rises in council tax have been announced by the Government this morning and will be implemented as soon as Friday. The rise is the latest in the catastrophic cost of living crisis being felt by Brits currently. Along with council tax, National Insurance, energy bills, and the biggest income crop recorded since the 1950s, this crisis is quickly beginning to outdo the 2008 financial crash. According the Government’s Wednesday morning release: “The average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2022 to 2023 will be £1,966, which is an increase of £67 or 3.5 percent on the 2021 to 2022 figure of £1,898.” The Government admits this does not take into account the £150 rebate being issued for bands A to D. Today’s figures confirm 63 out of 151 in England are lifting bills by more than 3 percent.

Experts have been dismayed by the news, with Andrew Dixon, founder of campaign group Fairer Share, demanding an overhaul to the entire council tax system. He said: “The latest council tax rises are exorbitant, inequitable and an affront to millions of people in modest homes up and down the UK. “The Chancellor now urgently needs to stop fiddling while Rome burns. “As the cost of living crisis escalates yet further, the time has come to kill off council tax and stamp duty and bring in a modern proportional property tax which reflects existing property prices, not values from over 30 years ago.” Tax Justice UK Executive Director Robert Palmer said the rise is yet another burden for British households already struggling. He said: “This is going to worsen the cost of living scandal faced by families right now. “An increase in council tax will hit poorer households much harder than wealthier ones.

He should close the tax loopholes open to the rich and powerful. “He should also implement a windfall tax on oil and gas companies like BP who are enjoying a massive windfall while people across the country struggle to pay their energy bills.” Council tax is calculated according to how much your home is worth. In England, it is based on your home valuation from 1991, and the devolved nations each have different bands to England, and Northern Ireland still has domestic rates instead of council tax. The current council tax bands for England are: A - Up to £40,000B - £40,000-£52,000C - £52,000-£68,000D - £68,000-£88,000E - £88,000-£120,000F - £120,000-£160,000G - £160,000-£320,000H - More than £320,000
