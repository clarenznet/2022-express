The spectacular Royal Air Force squadron roared over Yorkshire and Lincolnshire after taking to the skies to bid farewell to 100 Squadron at RAF Leeming, Yorkshire’s last remaining RAF base. The Squadron is being disbanded after 105 years of service, having been formed as a night bomber unit in 1917. It moved to RAF Leeming in 1995 and its black jets have been a familiar sight over the town of Northallerton. After days of intense preparations the nine jets departed their base at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshirethis afternoon and flew over Lincoln before heading north, passing over towns including Harrogate, Wetherby and Knaresborough before delighting tourists in the city of York. It marked the first Red Arrows sightings of the year in what will be a packed summer of Jubilee celebrations for the iconic Hawk and Typhoon jets. Officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows were formed in 1964 and their breath-taking displays frequently grace major national commemorations. Although they are currently based at RAF Scampton, they will be relocated to neighbouring RAF Waddington later this year when the historic base shuts down. They will continue to train in the UK until mid-Spring when they move overseas to a location with more predictable, settled weather to maximise flying hours and perfect this year’s routines. The team is then assessed by senior Royal Air Force officers, with the aim of gaining Public Display Authority. If this is awarded, the Squadron’s pilots change from green coveralls into their famous red flying suits and the ground crew are allowed to wear their royal blue display coveralls. Last season the Red Arrows carried out 37 public displays and 22 major flypasts.
