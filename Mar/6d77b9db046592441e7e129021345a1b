The Russian billionaire and Chelsea FC owner reportedly suffered symptoms at a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, as part of his efforts to act as a 'peacemaker' in the Russia Ukraine crisis. Sources said Mr Abramovich suffered symptoms including red eyes, constant, painful tearing, and skin peeling on his face and hands. On Tuesday, Mr Abramovich was pictured in Istanbul, with Reuters reporting he took part in further negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Other pictures showed him speaking to delegates including Turkish President, Recep Tayipp Erdogan. After being sanctioned by the UK government along with other prominent Russian figures, Mr Abramovich is understood to be acting as a mediator in the negotiations. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Mr Abramovich had offered to help broker a peace deal with the Kremlin. In response to the suspected poisoning reports, sources from the Kremlin say that they have "nothing to do with the reality," according to Reuters. The Russian government reportedly stated that the story is part of an "information war". Moreover, they added that Mr Abramovich is not an official member of the Russian delegation in Turkey. The oligarch is worth more than Â£9bn and has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. His private luxury yacht was anchored in the Cruise Port in Marmaris district of Mugla in Turkey on Friday last week.
