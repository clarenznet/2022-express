Nirvana and Guns N Roses helped define the sound of the 1990s, but the two never worked together. When Kurt Cobain’s band hit the mainstream with the release of Nevermind, GNR’s frontman Axl Rose was desperate to work with them. He repeatedly pleaded with the grunge singer to collaborate, but it was an unrequited love. During the 1992 MTV Music Video Awards, the pair finally battled backstage in an unexpected twist, Metallica’s lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was caught in the middle. The confrontation has become something of a legend in rock circles and as the years go on, the story only deepens as more musicians get caught in the mix. Sadly for Rose, Cobain didn’t want anything to do with him because he didn’t “approve of his behaviour,” according to Hammett. In an interview with Revolver, the guitarist explained: “I remember having to call Kurt up, because we wanted Nirvana to open up the Guns N Roses/Metallica tour. … This came down to me from my manager saying, ‘Okay, we've talked to Nirvana's management. They've told us no. … Kurt doesn't want to do it, because he doesn't want to be affiliated with Guns N Roses… [He] doesn't approve of Axl's behavior.’ A long laundry list of stuff and it's all about Guns N Roses and Axl. It had nothing to do with Metallica. They loved Metallica." The continual rejection eventually got to Rose, who once got on stage and infamously called Cobain and his wife Courtney Love “f**king junkies.” He added: “If the baby is born deformed, I think they both ought to go to prison.” However, as Hammett recalls, it was the 1992 MTV show then things truly went down.

I was sitting there talking to Kurt backstage, and all of a sudden f**king Axl walks up, sees me, and looks at Kurt and I'm like, ‘Oh no!’ And he goes right up to Kurt and says, ‘What's your problem, mother****r, what's your problem!’ And so Kurt's like, ‘Whatever, dude.’ …And [Axl's] like, ‘I'll f**king beat your ass. Come on. Let's go!’ And Kurt's just like, ‘Whatever, dude.’” He added: “And then Axl backed up and [his girlfriend] Stephanie Seymour was there. She put her hand on his arm and kind of calmed him down, and he was just like, ‘F**k you! … I'll kick your f**king ass.’ And Kurt's like, ‘Whatever.’ … Axl stormed off and Kurt looked at me and I was like, ‘Bro, that was f**king crazy.’ And Kurt's like, ‘Man, I don't know. That guy's nuts.’ And I was so shaken up. I said, ‘Kurt, man, I'm really sorry. I got to get out of here, man.’ He's like, "Yeah, man. That was just weird." The confrontation didn’t end there either, as Rose then came up to Hammett. Hammett continued: “Then at another point I was just standing, minding my own business, and then Axl f**king shows up again and he says to me, ‘What's up with your f**king friend?’ I go, ‘I don't know what's up, man. You guys have to work it out.’ And he goes, ‘Yeah, well, I'll f**king work it out with him.’ I was like, ‘Please man, just like ... it's between you guys. I don't know what's up with him. I don't know what's up with you. You guys just please, just work it out.’ And I was just being my usual apolitical self. I'm trying to just talk all this down, all this fucking confrontation, and somehow I felt like I was just fucking caught in the middle of it all rather innocently, you know?” Cobain wasn’t alone in the moment though, as he was joined by Love backstage.

Rose responded with threats: "You shut your b***h up, or I'm taking you down to the pavement!" Joking, Cobain turned to Love and said: “Shit up, b***h!” The battle then spread to the rest of the band members, as GNR’s bassist Duff Mckagan and his security repeatedly harassed Nirvana’s drummer and bassist, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, respectively. Clearly taunting the other group, Grohl then sang “Hi Axl,” into his mic during their performance of Lithium. After this public shouting match, the rivalry between the two grounds died down and faded away. Years later, Grohl recalled: “Guns N Roses was about to do this massive stadium tour with Metallica, and they wanted us to open. So Axl had been calling Kurt nonstop. One day we’re walking through an airport and Kurt says, ‘Fuck. Axl Rose won’t stop calling me.’ I think it represented something bigger. Nirvana didn’t want to turn into Guns N’ Roses. So, Kurt started talking s**t in interviews, and then Axl started talking back. It went back and forth like tenth-grade bulls**t.” Read the full interview with Revolver here.
