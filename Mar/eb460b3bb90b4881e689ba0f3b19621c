Camilla, 74, visited London's new headquarters of the Royal Academy of Dance yesterday. Joining a class, she took up some positions under the watchful eye of ex-Strictly judge Dame Darcey, 52. Also greeting her was Royal Academy chief executive Luke Rittner, who gave her a tour, and Mayor of Wandsworth Richard Field. The new building in York Road, Battersea, south London, is 60,000 square feet and almost double the size of the old premises. The Duchess of Cornwall - the Royal Academy's vice-patron since 2020 - unveiled a foundation stone, and revealed she has taken up over-55s ballet herself via the academy's Silver Swan scheme. Camilla then watched a Silver Swans class, led by Sarah Platt, who has taught the duchess herself. They were joined remotely by a class in Perth, Australia, instructed by Jamelia Gubgub. The duchess, who told attendees how "proud" she was of them, said: "I am very impressed by you. Being a silver swan myself I reckon I need to put in a lot of practice." Mr Rittner said of the visit: "She was just very complimentary about the building, very complimentary about the performers, and I think that she is very thrilled to be part of the organisation, really."
