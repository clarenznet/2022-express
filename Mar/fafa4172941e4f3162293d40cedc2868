Allegedly inspired by cockfighting, it is a battle for the affections of the epically indecisive John (Jonathan Bailey, from TV's Bridgerton) who has been living with boyfriend M (Taron 'Kingsman' Egerton) until afflicted by the seven-year itch. John subsequently has an affair with a woman, known only as W (Jade Anouka). Returning to the bereft M, he finds himself dilly-dallying between the two until a climactic dinner party where all three protagonists are joined by M's well-meaning father F (Phil Daniels). Marianne Elliott's sharp and speedy production is played out against a curved wall of shining metal whose smoky distortions reflect the actors and their opaque desires and identities. Naturalism takes a back seat as there are no props, and all actions - including sexual encounters and undressing - are conducted in minimal mime. And while the play pivots around serious conflicts, it is at times howlingly funny: John and M bicker like an old married couple; the pumped up, virile M conceals a wounded sensitivity; while John's dithering faux femininity is revealed as self-obsessed narcissism.   Daniels is reliably superb as the solid, decent father, spouting homilies about romantic love, while Anouka's W is smart, saucy and vulnerable. Bartlett's facility for digging down beyond surface cliches and redirecting sympathies mid-stream is formidable and, while Elliott discourages us from empathising too deeply with John's predicament, Cock is acutely observed and finely played by all.
