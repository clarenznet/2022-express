The US President told reporters that the “first lady’s husband” had Covid, seemingly mistaking the titles for his wife and the second gentleman of the US. Mr Biden appeared to forget that it is Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has tested positive for the disease.  He said: “The First Lady’s husband had contracted Covid, but look at this room and you’ll see...” At this point Mr Biden was interrupted by a member of staff who pointed out the mistake to him. The US President appeared confused and laughed with the audience before responding incoherently and again incorrectly. He said: “That’s right she’s fine, it’s me.  “The first gentleman, how about that.” The First Gentleman is a male equivalent of the term First Lady and is used to refer to men who are married to the president. It is likely Biden was meant to say the “second gentleman” which is used to refer to the husband of the Vice President. On Twitter Mr Biden was slammed for his latest embarrassing gaffe.
