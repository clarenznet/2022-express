Detectives investigating the alleged murder of 19-year-old Sabita Thanwani in Clerkenwell arrested 22-year-old Maher Maaroufe on Sunday. The young man was detained on suspicion of murder and assault on police and remains in police custody. Officers were called to Arbour House, in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell, at around 5.10am on Saturday to reports that Ms Thanwani, a British national, was injured. They attended along with medics to find she had suffered serious neck injuries but, despite their efforts, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Scotland Yard launched an appeal to help them trace Mr Maaroufe later on Saturday. Detective Chief Inspector Linda Bradley who leads the investigation said: “I would like to thank everyone for publicising and sharing our appeal to trace Maaroufe. “Sabita’s family have been updated with this development and continue to be supported by specially trained officers. "Our deepest condolences are with them." “I would ask everyone to respect their privacy at this indescribably devastating time for them as they come to terms with Sabita’s murder.”
