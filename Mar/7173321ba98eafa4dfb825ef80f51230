Express Royal Correspondent Richard Palmer was part of the press pack accompanying the Cambridges as they journeyed to the Caribbean to mark the Queen’s 70 years on the throne as part of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Richard sent a video update from Jamaica on the last episode, and told royal fans the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got “a pop star's welcome in Trench Town and were mobbed by crowds shouting ‘we love you’”. His stand-in for last week’s live chat with Assistant Head of Social Pandora Forsyth was GB News’ Royal Reporter Cameron Walker who updated on the protests encountered by the royal couple outside the Jamaican British High Commission building, with calls for the monarchy to pay reparations for slavery. You can get the chance to catch up with all the behind the scenes updates from the royal tour and more top stories from the past week, when Richard joins Pandora live on the Express Facebook Page on Thursday, March 30 at 2pm. The Foreign Office have been accused of not doing their job properly by failing to prepare the Royal couple for their Caribbean tour. It was described as a disaster as their trip has gained much bad press due to many Caribbean public figures speaking out and slamming the couple. And the Queen travelled to London to attend the memorial service for her beloved late husband Prince Philip. Many members of the British royal family and heads of state from foreign countries attended. However, noticeable in their absence were the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry was accused of 'doing nothing' as he and Meghan silent while family honour Philip.
