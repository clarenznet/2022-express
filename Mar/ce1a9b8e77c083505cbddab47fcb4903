The Europa League has reached the quarter-final stage and two British teams are involved in West Ham and Rangers, who are just two of eight teams dreaming of glory in Seville in May. Barcelona, RB Leipzig and Lyon are among the other big guns still remaining in the competition. West Ham secured their spot in the last eight by beating six-time winners Sevilla in stunning fashion at the London Stadium on Thursday night, winning 2-0 courtesy of Andriy Yarmolenko's extra-time strike to overturn a 1-0 first-leg loss. Rangers meanwhile overcame Red Star Belgrade despite losing 2-1 in Serbia. A 3-0 first-leg win was good enough for a 4-2 aggregate triumph. Elsewhere, Barcelona powered past Galatasaray after a goalless first leg. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored again as Xavi's side came from behind to win 2-1 and reach the next stage. But Real Betis were another Spanish team to bow out after Eintracht Frankfurt netted a 121st minute goal in extra time to give them a dramatic 3-2 aggregate win. That came after Betis only forced an extra 30 minutes with a 90th-minute goal. There are representatives from Italy, Portugal and France also in the last eight after Lyon beat Porto 2-1 on aggregate, drawing 1-1 last night. And Braga got the better of Monaco 3-1 on aggregate while Atalanta hold aloft the Italian flag in the next round after downing Germans Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 away from home and 4-2 over both games. RB Leipzig are automatically into the draw for the next round despite not playing in the last 16, because they were due to face Russia's Spartak Moscow who were barred from UEFA competitions as a result of their country's war on Ukraine.
