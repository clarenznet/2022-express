Following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine a number of countries from around the world have imposed sanctions against Moscow. The West has set its sights on crippling the Russian economy and its wealthiest oligarchs while also aiding Ukraine with munitions and humanitarian support.   A mediator in the Ukraine-Russia crisis, Israel has condemned President Putin’s invasion. However, the country is conscious of not straining relations with Moscow, a power-broker in neighbouring Syria where Israeli forces regularly attack pro-Iranian militia. Russian intervention in Syria’s civil war in 2015 turned the tide of the conflict in Bashar al-Assad’s favour. Moscow is now the major power in Syria’s skies, dropping bombs on Syrian civilians in areas still outside the regime’s control, and allowing the Israeli air force to operate against Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups active in the conflict. There is also some talk that action of any kind from Israel could stir up antisemitism against Ukraine and Russia’s large Jewish communities. Although Jersusalem has imposed some sanctions against Russia it has stopped short of adopting all the measures announced by the West. For example, the country has not officially passed any regulations or orders that would affect Israeli companies doing business with Russia.

Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked why Jerusalem was not providing missile defences to his country or sanctioning Russia over its invasion. During an address to Israel’s parliament, last Sunday, Mr Zelensky said the “choice is yours to make” and that “you must then live with your answer”. He said: “Everybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best. And that you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews.”  In a statement Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said his country would continue to assist the Ukrainian people "as much as we can" but was non-committal on whether that would extend beyond sending humanitarian aid. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with President Vladimir Putin two weeks ago in Moscow and has spoken frequently with him and Mr Zelensky since then. The deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, Ihor Zhovkva, told Politico that the time has now come for Israel to pick a side in the war. He said: “As far as Israel is concerned, yeah, I think they should be more decisive in finding their place in this Ukraine-Russian war.”  DON'T MISS: Putin humiliated as hardman Chechen special forces go home [NEWS]Putin bowel cancer speculation fuelled by ‘Moon face’ fears [INSIGHT]Germany blocks West from scuppering Putin's energy ties [EXPLAINED] Mr Zhovkva noted Israel is still allowing flights to operate from Russia but has ended visa-free travel for Ukrainians. He also accused Mr Bennett’s Government of staying silent after Ukraine said a Russian airstrike hit near the Babi Yar memorial. The tribute marks where German Nazis killed tens of thousands of Jews during World War Two. He added: “I didn’t hear a clear position from the leadership of Israel.”  At present the UK, EU and US have imposed sanctions on hundreds of members of the Russian regime, and wealthy business leaders known as oligarchs, who are considered close to the Kremlin. Elsewhere, the US has announced it’s banning all Russian oil and gas imports and the UK will phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022. Western countries have frozen the assets of Russia's central bank, to stop it using its $630bn (£470bn) of foreign currency reserves, and some banks are being removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. A growing number of international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have also suspended trading in Russia.
