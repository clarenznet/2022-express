The Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements mean card holders will have to confirm two of three things. These are "something they are", such as a fingerprint or facial ID; "something they know", including passcodes; and "something they have", e.g. a mobile. People may find they are asked to verify a purchase via text message more often, receiving a passcode which they are prompted to enter on screen. Other confirmations could include answering an automated phone call to a landline or mobile. A spokeswoman for the banking and finance industry trade association UK Finance said SCA "is an important tool in the fight against fraud, adding an additional layer of protection when people pay online using a card". She added: "Customers should make sure their bank has their correct contact details. "If a customer has any specific needs, they should contact their bank to discuss what help is available."  The proportion of transactions for which SCA applies has been steadily increasing since the start of this year. Some transactions may be exempt, including repeated purchases such as subscriptions. Tom Ironside, at the British Retail Consortium, said: "Retailers have been working hard to prepare for the SCA requirements, ensuring... any additional friction is kept to a minimum. "Customers should be reassured that buying online has never been safer." But Dennis Reed, of senior citizens' group Silver Voices, said: "Of course we want to combat online fraud. "But to do things like have fingerprints or face recognition technology is going to put a lot of older people off."
