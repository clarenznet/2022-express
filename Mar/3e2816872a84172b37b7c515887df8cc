Campaign group Action on Salt surveyed 360 products, two-thirds of which claimed to be healthy. Co-op’s lemon and coriander olives had over 2g of salt, equal to five portions of salted peanuts. A Ginsters pasty had 1.89g, or more than 5.5 packets of salted crisps. A Subway chicken sandwich had 5.3g – almost a whole day’s worth and more than a Big Mac and fries. Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure for lowering blood pressure and reducing the number of people dying from strokes, heart disease and life changing disabilities.”
