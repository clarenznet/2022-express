Max George has split up with his girlfriend of two years, Stacey Giggs, it has been reported. He recently starred on the Strictly Come Dancing tour, where he was paired with Katya Jones. Max, 33, began dating 38-year-old Stacey in 2019, three years after her divorce from ex-Manchester United player Ryan. But trouble appears to be brewing after he cleared his social media of photos of Stacey, and The Sun claimed the pair have officially gone their separate ways. Express.co.uk has contacted representatives for Max, Stacey and Katya for comment. Max was previously in a relationship with Michelle Keegan, and has also enjoyed a fling with Amy Willerton. After he competed on the 2020 series of Strictly, Max returned for the tour this year and danced with 32-year-old Katya, who used to be married to her fellow Strictly pro Neil Jones. Max has Stacey’s name tattooed on his wrist, and he once said the idea of splitting up with her was “unthinkable”. Speaking in 2019, the boyband member said Stacey was “the one” and he wanted to have a baby with her one day. “I’d like to think this is it for me now, she’s the one. I’ve never felt so strongly about anyone,” he told The Sun on Sunday. “I’m like, ‘Just say Max, that’s fine.’ “I’m not a dad. I kind of blend in, I’m one of them. Stacey’s upstairs on her own and I’m down there with the kids. But it works.” Max has recently been performing on a greatest hits tour with The Wanted, as Tom Parker took to the stage in a wheelchair amid his battle with a brain tumour. Tom was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma in October 2020. Last year, he revealed his cancer is stable but it appeared his continued treatment has left him too weak to stand. Posting a photo with Tom, Max praised him as a “hero”. “It's been an epic few weeks… One last show my boy…” he wrote. “You are a true hero mate. Can't wait for the next tour with you…Liverpool… Can you hear us???!”
