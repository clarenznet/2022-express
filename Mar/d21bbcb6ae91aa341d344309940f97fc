In a statement, the bank confirmed the decision was taken as part of its “transformation” into how branches operate within individual communities. Going forward, HSBC has pledged to offer more varied services for its customers outside of the traditional banking model. However, the result of this will see 69 branches close throughout the country, which many vulnerable customers may be reliant on. What do you think? Join the debate in the comments section here. As part of HSBC’s transformation, local areas will see more community pop-ups, new integrated self-service machines and further digital support for customers, which will be assisted by colleagues. Furthermore, the bank will continue to use the Post Office network as part of its wider operations. These changes are part of HSBC’s efforts to invest in its digital and mobile service, reflecting the needs of customers. Under 50 percent of the bank’s customers now actively use its branch network, with the average footfall declining over 50 percent since 2017, according to the bank.

She added: “We know that the majority of our customers have a preference to do much of their day-to-day banking online or via mobile, so we’re removing locations where we have another branch nearby, and where there is a significant reduction in customers using face-to-face branch servicing. “This will enable us to invest in locations where our customers are continuing to utilise the branch network, including updating technology and refurbishing branches.”
