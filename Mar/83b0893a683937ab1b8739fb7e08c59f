In 1967 the song stayed at No.1 for six weeks and is constantly played on radio stations around the world to this day. Born in Hackney, east London, Gary Brooker's father Harry was an entertainer who earned a humble living in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. When he was 17, Brooker started a rhythm and blues band with his friend Robin Trower on guitar and The Paramounts hit the No.35 slot with Poison Ivy. But the breakthrough came in 1966 when he formed a new band with lyricist Keith Reid. Procol Harum took their name from a Latin phrase which means "far beyond these things". Playing around with a Bach melody, Brooker came up with the tune which inspired Reid to write the immortal opening line, "We skipped the light fandango." Matthew Fisher's organ playing gave the song a slightly religious feel, but it was to prove the band's only No.1 hit, although they reached No.6 in the charts with their follow up, Homburg. However, Fisher and Brooker fell out over the rights to A Whiter Shade Of Pale, culminating in a court case in 2006 in which the judge asked Brooker to play the tune as he had done on his mother's piano in Southend-on-Sea back in 1967.  Daily Express journalist David Robson, who was at the hearing, wrote at the time: "It was electrifying and awe-inspiring. When he finished there was silence in court - a silenter shade of silence." But Fisher still won 40 percent of Brooker's royalties. Brooker is survived by his Swiss-born wife Francoise (Franky) Riedo, whom he married in 1968.
