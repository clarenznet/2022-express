Head down to the bottom of the page for Wordle 273 hints, and good luck figuring out the answer. Wordle tasks players with figuring out a different five letter word each day. After you take a guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. You can share your score on social media, while the app itself keeps track of your statistics. The only bad news is that if you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Even worse, your winning streak will be reset back to zero.
