And one in six women confessed they worried that exercising while menstruating is harmful. Menstruation underwear brand WUKA (WAKE UP AND KICK ASS) will provide the Wales Women’s national senior squad with a range of sustainable period underwear. It is the first period pants brand to sponsor a sports team. Jo Perkins, Wales Women head physio, said: “This partnership is fantastic news for us as a programme, and for female sport in general. “As part of our performance programme we are looking at many ways in which we can support players so they can reach their full potential on the pitch - and that includes tackling aspects of female health. “Acknowledging the importance of periods is the first important step. The menstrual cycle should be seen as a real advantage to women, not only as a sign of good health - but by adapting nutrition and training at key times in the cycle, women can make performance gains. “WUKA is the perfect partner. With this practical support, players will be able to feel strong, confident and supported to help them concentrate on performing rather than worry about other factors.” Ruby Raut, founder of WUKA, said: “From our research, we know that some women still feel they face barriers in some sports whilst menstruating. “We feel it’s important to educate women around the benefits of exercising and playing sport during periods. “We also want to highlight the great variety of sanitary products now available that can cater to women of all shapes and sizes for many different sports.”
