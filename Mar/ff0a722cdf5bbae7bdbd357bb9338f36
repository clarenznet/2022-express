Kate Middleton and Prince William have been on a royal tour in the Caribbean for the past week. The Duchess has pulled out all the stops with her outfits during this trip, including a satin number last night. The royal couple attended a reception hosted by the Governor General at Baha Mar Resort. Kate wore a satin blue gown, by Phillipa Lepley, which had a front crossover bodice. It pulled in at the waist before continuing into a floor length skirt with loose pleats. The simple but stunning design had tie detailing at the shoulders.
