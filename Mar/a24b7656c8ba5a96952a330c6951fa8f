Manchester United may be able to use Mauricio Pochettino to their advantage in order to find a solution over Marcus Rashford's immediate future at the club ahead of the summer transfer window. The Paris Saint-Germain boss has been heavily linked with the Red Devils job in recent months, while Erik ten Hag of Ajax is also understood to be among those on the club's radar in advance of next season. Interim boss Ralf Rangnick is set to move into a consultancy role at the end of the current campaign to leave United with the task of sourcing a new permanent head coach over the coming months.Pochettino has consistently declined to shed any light on the rumours linking him with a return to the Premier League in the near future but is widely believed to be near the top of United's managerial shortlist.The Red Devils have already reached out to gauge his interest in the prospect of taking charge at Old Trafford, according to The Guardian.However, it is also claimed that Ten Hag has been approached in a similar fashion and is another candidate with the potential to emerge as the frontrunner in United's ongoing search for a new manager.A move for Pochettino, though, would have clear implications with regards to the immediate future of Rashford ahead of next season.

The Argentine boss clearly rates Rashford and could be up for the challenge of helping to revive the forward's United career if he decides to swap Paris for Manchester over the next few months.It remains to be seen whether the Red Devils will eventually opt to pile their resources into a move for Pochettino, who remains tied down to PSG until at least the summer of 2023.Former England striker Kevin Phillips recently insisted that Pochettino would have what it takes to end United's ongoing five-year trophy drought, which looks set to leave them empty-handed for yet another season as things stand."The obvious accusation is that he never won any trophies at Tottenham," Phillips told Football Insider last month.

I think he would have big funds to go out and sign the players he wanted [at United]."At Spurs, he didn’t have that because of the money spent on the stadium. He can clearly get the best out of players, we saw that at Spurs."When you do that at United and the players you can bring in, they will win trophies. When you consider his style of play as well, it makes sense to me." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport? Join our brand new Facebook group by clicking here
