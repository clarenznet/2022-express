Daniil Kvyat has criticised the governing bodies of world sport over their calls for Russian teams and athletes to be banned from international competition as a result of the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. A number of sporting measures have already been handed down by the likes of FIFA and UEFA, while the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have asked for Russian competitors to be prevented from taking part in events until further notice. FIFA announced on Sunday that Russia's national team had been suspended from all international tournaments, meaning they will not be able to fulfil their World Cup play-off matches later this month.Their verdict followed UEFA's decision to withdraw Spartak Moscow from the Europa League before terminating their long-term partnership with Russian state-owned energy firm Gazprom.Meanwhile, there are still questions over whether Formula One will follow suit by banning Haas driver Nikita Mazepin from taking part in the upcoming 2022 season.Kvyat, who raced in F1 until he was dropped by AlphaTauri at the end of 2020, has since expressed his view that the world's governing bodies should cease mixing sport with politics as the bans are unfair on the individual athletes in question."I really hope for a peaceful solution to this situation in Ukraine and that we can all live in peace," wrote Kvyat in a lengthy Instagram post on Monday. JUST IN: Toto Wolff's 'significant' Mercedes fears answered by Michael Andretti "Hopefully all parties can find a solution by sitting together and through a respectful dialogue. It horrifies me to see two brotherhood nations in a conflict."I don't want military actions and wars to influence the future of humanity, I want my daughter and all children to enjoy this beautiful world."I also would like to highlight and address all sports federations across the world, including the IOC, that sport should remain outside politics."Disallowing Russian athletes and teams from participating in world competitions is an unfair solution and goes against what sport teaches us in its principle, the unity and peace. "Who else if not us sports people will help to glue nations together in the upcoming times?"Kvyat, who hails from the Russian city of Ufa, served as a test and reserve driver with Alpine in 2021 and would be affected by an FIA ban on the country's drivers after signing up for this year's World Endurance Championship.The likes of Mazepin, Ferrari junior Robert Shwartzman, Formula Three driver Alexander Smoylar and Kvyat's WEC outfit G-Drive Racing may also be prevented from competing if a blanket ban is enforced.The former could be removed from his seat at Haas if the American team decide to cancel their lucrative sponsorship deal with Russian potash firm Uralkali in the coming days.

However, Haas team principal Guenther Steiner recently jumped to Mazepin's defence by insisting that he is in no way responsible for the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. "The best thing is to not look at what is there because at the moment, he has nothing to do with this," Steiner told reporters last week."We just need to crack on and see where this ends up and work through it. Hopefully he can keep his head up and keep on going."
