As it was reported, first class Royal Mail stamps will become more expensive by 10p, and will now cost 95p, while second class stamps prices rise by 2p to 68p each. Reading the news about the price rise on Express.co.uk, a reader commented that they will be turning to other companies instead. Royal Mail hikes prices of stamps - first and second class hit by major shake up The reader, with the user name "Chihuahua face", said: ”Well I won’t be sending anything by post, anymore Christmas cards and birthday cards or off the list. Just send them via one of the great marketing companies.” Another consumer with the user name "Retep13" reflected the same thoughts, by writing: “It has not occurred to Royal Mail that if you put up, prices people use other services and thus less mail is sent.” And they continued: “I think the real reason is to kill off universal mail delivery and concentrate on parcels to make more money. “This is one example of where privatisation has not worked.” Worried about the stamps’ prices being high, a reader with the user name "Chris4454x" complained: “They have got to be joking? 95p to post a letter? “All it will achieve is that even fewer letters are posted. They are running an obsolete service into the ground.” According to Royal Mail, UK stamps are still cheaper than in any other European country. The company announced that the price hikes are due to inflation, but also due to the fact that demand has decreased as people send fewer letters. A frustrated consumer with the user name "LoveJaguars" wrote: “Prices have to go up because fewer letters are being posted, hmm, not surprising is it at the prices being charged at the moment is it.” They added: “I warrant that even fewer will be posted after this latest piece of lunacy from the Post Office!”
