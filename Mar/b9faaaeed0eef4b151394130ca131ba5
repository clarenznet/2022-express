Ray Stanley spotted a chance to stay active in his later years so asked bosses if he could take on the task of distributing the mail. The grandfather-of-two collects letters from the postbox outside the residence in Poole, Dorset, and hands them out. Thoughtful staff at Upton Bay Care Home contacted the Royal Mail depot and asked if they could provide a uniform - and they gladly obliged. Ray does his round in an embroidered shirt and cap - and even has his own red post bag. The retired RAF navigator and transport consultant said: "It's been quite a laugh. There's a postbox down the front and at 1.30 pm we empty the letters out. "Then my wheelchair is wheeled around and I deliver the letters. I meet a lot of people who probably wouldn't know me otherwise. "I enjoy visiting Memory Lane, where people living with dementia are cared for. I feel like I'm bringing them a little bit of joy."
