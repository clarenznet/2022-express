Campaign group "Get Britain Out" said the government has shown a "lack of ambition" in rolling out freeports in the years since Britain left the EU. Get Britain Out director Jayne Adye described Boris Johnson as having "a lack of backbone" when it comes to Brexit. She said: “The Government continues to show no urgency to implement the rollout of Freeports within the United Kingdom. This is being hampered by increased bureaucracy, Boris Johnson’s obsession with Net-Zero and an apparent lack of backbone which continues to get in the way." “The Prime Minister consistently tries to claim the electoral benefits of ‘completing’ Brexit, meanwhile he consistently fails to deliver on his promises."
