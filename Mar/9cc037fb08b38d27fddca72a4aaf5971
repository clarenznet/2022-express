And the cost of returning the roads to a state allowing cost-effective maintenance could rocket to £12.64billion, the survey by the Asphalt Industry Alliance claims. That figure has risen from £10.24billion in a year. The AIA's annual local authority road maintenance (Alarm) research indicated the proportion of council budgets allocated to highway maintenance has fallen during the 2021-'22 financial year. It dropped from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in England, excluding London where it dived from two per cent to 1.6 per cent. In Wales, the figure plunged from 4.5 to three per cent. Almost one in five local roads may need to be rebuilt in the next five years because of their condition, which equates to nearly 37,000 miles. The Alarm survey also suggested that roads are typically resurfaced only once every 70 years. AIA chairman Rick Green said: "The link is clear between continued underinvestment and the structural decline and below par surface conditions of local roads.  "Local authority highway teams have a legal responsibility to keep our roads safe but do not have the funds to do so in a cost-effective way." David Renard, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: "Despite the efforts of councils, which repair a pothole every 19 seconds, these stark new figures show that councils need further government investment and certainty on future funding over the next decade." Nicholas Lyes, RAC's head of roads policy, said the report "provides a sobering picture of the dire condition of our local road network".
