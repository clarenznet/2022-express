Prince William was overheard using a sweet monicker for his daughter during a family engagement. The Duke of Cambridge stepped out with his three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis - in May 2019 to show support to his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. At the time, the Duchess took part in the Royal Chelsea Flower by showcasing a concept garden she created with the help of experts. The three little Cambridges were photographed playing around Kate's garden, where they went on swings, climbed trees and stepped into a small river. During the family visit, Prince William also took part in the playful activities and was heard calling out to Charlotte to ask her to give him a push on the swing. However, instead of calling his daughter by name, he was heard saying "Mignonette".

The third-in-line to the throne is also believed to have been given a few adorable nicknames over the past years. One is reportedly PG, which comes from a shortened version of his name and title. A second, even more adorable, moniker for George, is believed to be PG Tips, in a nod to the tea brand.  Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are currently spending time away from their parents, as the Duke and Duchess are touring three Caribbean nations. The children are likely being looked after by the Cambridges' trusted nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. But they may also be in the care of Kate's beloved parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. Kate and Prince William mentioned a few times their children during their ongoing trip.  During a reception held in Belize, the Duke said his son George keeps track of his parents' journeys around the world by locating the countries they visit on a map and pinning them down. On the other hand, the Duchess mentioned her children while visiting a cocoa farm. As she was offered freshly-made chocolate, Kate admitted her children would be "jealous" of her trip.
