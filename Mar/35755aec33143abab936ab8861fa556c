After concluding his and his wife Kate’s eight-day Caribbean royal tour over the weekend, the Duke of Cambridge released an unprecedented, statement about the future governance of Commonwealth nations. It comes after the tour was marred by a series of protests. In a closing statement, he said the trip had brought into sharper focus “questions about the past and the future”, before adding: “Catherine and I are committed to service. For us, that’s not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have." Royal biographer Angela Levin claims William's comment about "not telling people what to do" was a “dig” at his brother, who has vocally campaigned for a number of causes since quitting royal duties. Speaking on Sky News, the author said of William's comments: "I think he’s right, I think that worked very well to say what he felt without telling people what to do - which I thought was also a dig at his brother." It comes as the Queen, 95, is “determined” to join members of the Royal Family at Westminster Abbey today for the Duke of Edinburgh's service of thanksgiving. Ms Levin said of the monarch’s planned appearance: "She looks much, much better and it's very important for her to appear. And I think we've been told that she will, she hasn't said she's going to leave it until the absolute last minute and I think it would be heartbreaking for her not to be able to get there.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
