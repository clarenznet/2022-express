And remember, you only have 24-hours to solve Wordle 281, so you'd better hurry. Good luck! If you haven't played Wordle and want to know what all the fuss is about, here's how it works. Players are given just six chances to correctly guess a five-letter word. You'll need to use the process of elimination to figure out the answer, paying close attention to the colour of the tiles. If a tile turns grey, then the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. You can share your score on social media (for bragging rights), while the app itself keeps track of your statistics. On the flipside, if you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released.
