Last month, Andrea Bocelli’s son Matteo Bocelli release his third single Dime. The Spanish track, written with Mahmood and Sylvia Tofani came with a music video, seeing the 24-year-old playing the acoustic guitar on a rooftop before traversing a city centre with a love interest. Now, as promised, the rising star has released a new version of the track. Having performed Dime in Spanish, Matteo has also released an Italian version called Dimmi and fans can check out the music videos for both here. Both Dime and Dimmi are the singer’s first tracks in Italian and Spanish, following on from Close and Solo. Fans can expect all these tracks to feature on the 24-year-old’s debut album, which will be released later on in 2022.

And I believe that his very promising single Solo shows that. As for duets, it is true that the song Fall On Me was a beautiful occasion that we have seized upon as a family, perhaps without truly thinking it through but with great enthusiasm. And the public appreciated the genuineness of the emotions involved. But I also think that my son has, today, wings strong enough to take flight by himself.”
