Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky heaped praise on Britain, saying Boris Johnson has helped in the fight against Russia "more than other leaders". He said: "Britain is definitely on our side. It is not performing a balancing act. Britain sees no alternative for the way out of the situation. "Britain wants Ukraine to win and Russia to lose, but I’m not ready to say whether Britain wants the war to drag on or not." His comments come after the Ukrainian leader issued a scathing attack in a series of interviews of the weekend, with France's President bearing the brunt of the critics. Mr Zelenskyy fiercely criticized Emmanual Macron for failing to support his country militarily, saying it was "because they are afraid of Russia. And that’s it. And those who say it first are the first to be afraid.” And speaking about Germany, he said: "They are trying to be balanced. They have a long relationship with Russia and they are looking at the situation through the prism of the economy. They help out at times. I think they are trying to adjust to the situation as it develops." HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
