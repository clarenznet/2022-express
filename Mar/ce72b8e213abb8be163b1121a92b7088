Many clutched their faces to protect themselves from noxious fumes and 29 were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties yesterday. The London Aquatics Centre at Stratford was cordoned off owing to a "chemical reaction" with a "high quantity of chlorine gas" released, said firefighters. A witness, wearing only trunks, said: "Everyone was running out, coughing and trying to cover their mouths." An Aquatics Centre spokesman said the leak occurred "when the facilities management company that operates the plant room took delivery of pool chemicals".
