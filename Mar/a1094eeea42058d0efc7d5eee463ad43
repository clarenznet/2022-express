If you fancy chopping down your broadband bill and making a saving on your smartphone at the same time then Virgin Media may have just the deal. Thanks to its partnership with O2, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) is currently offering access to the web along with a SIM card for your smartphone from just £29.99 per month - that's a bit of a bargain! Virgin Media and O2 have been featuring these special 'Volt' offers for a while but what makes these latest options more attractive is that they now include faster speeds and extra data for free. This means you can sign up for 50Mbps broadband speeds and get a free boost to 100Mbps plus there's a SIM with a generous 10GB of monthly data for the price of 5GB. To make things even better, Virgin has also scrapped the usual £35 setup fee making it total free to join to the firm. Considering most broadband suppliers want around £40 per month for those download speeds and a 10GB SIM will cost around £10 per month this is a decent deal from Virgin. Along with this "Supercharged" M100 Volt bundle, there's also a Volt 200 option which includes 200Mbps broadband for the price of 100Mbps plus a 10GB SIM SIM from O2 which is double the usual amount. This deal costs £35.99 per month. Finally, there are even faster speeds with Virgin boosting its usual 200Mbs service up to 350Mbps plus there's that 10GB SIM included as well. This deal costs £41.99 per month.
