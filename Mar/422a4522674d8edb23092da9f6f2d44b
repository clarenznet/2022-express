  Laura, 39, wowed her followers as she posed in the flattering garment. The dress featured a mixture of animal print patterns in black, white and green. The star held her leg out in order to show off the thigh-high split that ran up the right hand side of the frock. She finished off the bold look with a pair of black stiletto heels. She captioned the picture in a message to her co-star Jasmine Harman: “I’m going for the leg split dress too this week @jasmineharman!  “Prob not the best dress choice in this weather in Spain… “It’s grey, overcast and blowing a gale…but let’s smile, have fun and be grateful… hopefully going to change someone’s life this week…” (sic) Her co-star Lucy Alexander commented with a sun and laughing emoji: “You get all the luck…” While Cathie Handley wrote: “Great dress, you look lovely Laura.” Mervyn Cowdell added: “Looking great Laura. Have a good week!”
