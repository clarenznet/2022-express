Police were called to Wood Lane, White City, where Television Centre is located, at 11.14am to reports of a "suspicious item".  White City and Wood Lane tube stations were closed and the area was evacuated. ITV's live shows, which are filmed at Television Centre, went off air due to the incident. Viewers were left baffled after This Morning went off air suddenly and Loose Women did not air a live show. The Met Police said the incident was stood down just before 12.49pm and an investigation is ongoing.  A spokesperson for the force said: "At 11.14am on Thursday, 10 March, police were called to reports of a security alert at Wood Lane, White City. "It was reported a suspicious item had been discovered. "The area was evacuated as a precaution and White City and Wood Lane tube stations were temporarily closed. "The incident was stood down shortly before 12.49pm.  "An investigation is ongoing." This Morning went to an advert break during the final 15 minutes of the live show, but when it returned, an old episode of the show was being aired. Loose Women, which is on ITV immediately after This Morning, also did not air a live show. Tweets on the This Morning and Loose Women accounts said: "We apologise for the break in live programming today.   "We are currently running pre-recorded content and hope to be back with you soon." TfL Access tweeted at 12.18pm: "White City and Wood Lane stations closed: While the police respond to a security alert outside the station." Hammersmith and Fulham Police tweeted at 1.18pm: "Police dealt with a #SuspiciousPackage reported at 11:44hrs this morning at #WhiteCity. "The incident was stood down at 12:49hrs.
