Demi Moore, 59, looked amazing as she joined many celebrity faces at the Saint Laurent Womenswear show last night. The actress left hearts racing as she flashed her cleavage in a plunging black jumpsuit. The jumpsuit featured three gold buttons, making sure not to take attention away from the low neckline and the actress's enviable figure. She styled the outfit with a pair of unmissable blue leather gloves and a coordinated blue pendant necklace. Her effortless complexion dazzled many as she wore minimal make up for the event. Demi's famous black tresses were straight as her hair fell to her hips. Others at the event included Victoria Beckham, Romeo Beckham, Donatella Versace and Amber Valletta.
