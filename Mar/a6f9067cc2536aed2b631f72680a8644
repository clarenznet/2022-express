West Ham are through to the quarter-finals of the Europa League after Andriy Yarmolenko's goal in extra time saw the east London outfit secure a dramatic win over Sevilla at the London Stadium on Thursday evening. The Hammers were 1-0 down on aggregate heading into the second leg after Munir El Haddadi scored in the opening tie. West Ham had it all to do in front of their home fans and were immediately on the front foot throughout. Tomas Soucek then brought them level with Sevilla on aggregate six minutes before the breaking, send the home fans wild. And it was West Ham who were pushing for the winner in the second half as Michail Antonio led the line for the hosts.

The winger looked to the skies as he marked the special moment, and went over to the crowd where Ukraine flags were being waved.
