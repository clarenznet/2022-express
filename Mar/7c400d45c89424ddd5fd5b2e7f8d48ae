Ever since Wordle became a daily smash-hit sensation,Â  dozens and dozens of clones have appeared online and on the various app stores. Needless to say, the vast majority are a bit rubbish or gimmicky, but every now and then you come across a true diamond in the rough. One such Wordle clone is Heardle, which is a music-based puzzle featuring a new song each day. Read on for more about Heardle and how to play the latest Wordle alternative. The aim of Heardle is to guess the day's song by listening to its intro. It's that simple. Where things get interesting is that for every incorrect or skipped guess, you unlock more of the song. This is where the competitive element comes into play. For ultimate bragging rights, you'll need to guess correctly in as few tries as possible, at which point you can share you score online. Like Wordle, you have six attempts to get the right answer, and you can search for artists and song names when entering your answer. Pop on something from the 1980s and 1990s and I reckon I could solve it no problem. Anything from the past few years and I think I'd struggle. Did you manage to correctly guess today's Heardle puzzle? Let us know in the comments below - without actually spoiling the answer for other players. You can play Heardle by visiting the following link. As for Wordle, the popular puzzle game gives players six chances to figure out a different five-letter word each day. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released.
