Photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and reporter Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, died when their vehicle was hit by artillery shelling outside Kyiv on Monday. British-born reporter Benjamin Hall, 39, who was also in the car, was hit in his legs by shrapnel and is said to be fighting for his life. Both men worked for Fox News, which confirmed Mr Zakrzewski’s death yesterday. Ms Kuvshinova had been working with the team for the past month. She was described as “funny and kind” by a producer with the US news channel. Married Mr Zakrzewski, who was based in London, had been in Ukraine since February, working as a photographer, engineer, editor and producer. Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst wrote of the veteran of major conflicts, including Iraq and Afghanistan: “Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate.” In a statement, Fox News said: “He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists.”
