At a High Court hearing in London yesterday, Google Ireland Ltd apologised to Mr Anderson, who had been left "extremely distressed". Felicity McMahon, the barrister representing the MP for Ashfield, Notts, told Judge Jaron Lewis the advert, displayed on the Guido Fawkes political website in February 2021, implied he was "protective of or sympathetic to, the abuse of children and those who perpetrate such abuse". Ms McMahon said that Mr Anderson, 55, was told the advert from Google Ads was on the Guido Fawkes site, which attracts hundreds of thousands of readers. She said the ad linked to a "fringe campaign group" called Keeping Kids Safe and featured a picture of Mr Anderson next to the headline "MP Office protect paedophile". She added: "This was highly defamatory, threatening to erode the confidence of the claimant's constituents in him as their elected representative." Ms McMahon said Mr Anderson had settled a "threatened action" for defamation, and breach of data protection law and rights, with Google Ireland. Barrister Hope Williams, representing Google Ireland, said the firm "sincerely" apologised to Mr Anderson. She told the judge the advert should not have been displayed as it did not comply with Google Ads policies, adding that it had been removed as soon as Mr Anderson raised the issue.
