The Emirati-flagged Al Salmy 6 capsized off the coast of Iran in a storm. Captain Nizar Qaddoura said emergency services had saved 16 of his crew, while 11 had made it onto a life raft and one was picked up by a nearby tanker. But two were still bobbing in the water. He said the crew were from Sudan, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The vessel - owned by the Salem Al Makrani Cargo company, based in Dubai - was carrying cars to the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr when it went down 30 miles off Asaluyeh in southern Iran. Accidents there are rare but Iran meteorologists this week issued a "red alert" for 40mph plus gusts and high waves.
