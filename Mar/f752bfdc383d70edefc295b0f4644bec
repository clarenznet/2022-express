WhatsApp appears to be testing a much-needed upgrade to its Android app that copies a feature iPhone users have enjoyed for years. iMessage reactions aren't anything new with users of this service quickly able to respond to texts using icons such as thumbs up or exclamation marks. Now WhatsApp users are finally getting something very similar with this upgrade currently being tried out via WhatsApp's beta tests programme. As spotted by the ever-reliable team at WABetaInfo, WhatsApp has released this upgrade its beta for Android 2.22.8.3 and it includes the option to reply to messages via emoji-style reactions. It seems there will be six options to choose from including a thumbs up, love heart, and laughing face. Just like in Apple's iMessage, these reactions can be placed on top of a message to make replying much faster. For example, if someone sends a message that makes you happy you can simply overlay the love heart or laugh emoji reaction on top of it rather than typing a long reply. READ MORE: Use Android?
