Parts of the sky are beginning to turn orange and yellow due to a weather phenomenon. This is due to a Saharan dust cloud making its way to the UK, and the Met Office has said the dust cloud, which is 2km above ground level, may fall during showers in southern parts of the country in the afternoon. Richard Miles, of the Met Office, said: "Storm Celia over Spain is indeed pulling a dust cloud up from the Sahara, which could potentially reach as far as the south of the UK. "However, we don't expect significant impacts - the most likely would be on the cloudscapes at sunset, but as conditions are likely to be generally overcast and wet for much of the day this is unlikely to amount to much. There are no air quality warnings. "People in the south might find a bit of dust left on their cars as the rain washes it out of the skies today."   Orange skies are likely in the south of the UK, with forecasters unsure of how prominent the effect will be. "Although it won't be as severe here, you'll notice the sky colour." If the full effect of the Saharan dust does hit the UK, there's likely to be residue on cars and windows. There are also some health risks for those with lung conditions.
