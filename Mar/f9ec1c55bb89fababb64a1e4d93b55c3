Prices will rise across the board with petrol and diesel drivers who cause the highest air pollution set to pay considerably more. HM Revenue and Customs previously reported the changes in the Autumn Budget rates and allowances policy paper. However, the changes do not come into effect until April at the start of the new tax year. The new rules will see the standard rate of car tax increase by £10 for all petrol and diesel owners. This will see the standard rate rise from £155 per year to £165 in a major blow to road users. However, the highest increase comes from the first year tax rate for brand new cars.

Rates then increase by around £10 up to cars which produce 151 to 170 g/km. These models will pay £585 in tax costs over the first year, up from £555 in 2021/22. The higher increases are saved for the most polluting models on the road with costs up £105 for cars producing 226 to 255 g/km.

First year rates will rise from £2,245 to £2,365 from the 2022/23 tax year. HM Revenue and Customs warn some extra charges could also apply on top of the stated fees. Cars with a lost price of over £40,000 when new will pay an additional £355 charge for five years. This means drivers will be forced to pay over £2,900 for a highly polluting new car in the first year. Thus would then see costs rise above £500 on the standard rates in a massive financial blow. Alternative fuelled vehicles, including hybrids, bioethanol and cars running on liquid petroleum gas will also pay £155 per annum. The DVLA has warned drivers must have their vehicle taxed at all times. Drivers who believe they are exempt must also still apply to receive a special tax class. The DVLA warns those who fail to pay their tax fees could face financial penalties. This can include getting a wheel clamped, court action or eventually losing their vehicle if they fail to take action.
