Mr Johnson will face renewed pressure to resign during today's PMQs after the Metropolitan Police announced it will issue 20 fines in connection with the Downing Street lockdown breaches. The force has not named the individuals facing the penalties or revealed which events they attended. But a number of former Tory rebels now appear to be rallying around the embattled Prime Minister.
