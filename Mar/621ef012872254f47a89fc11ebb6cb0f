His boat the Susan Chase came in about five minutes ahead of four others including one featuring the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate looked shipshape in a pair of khaki shorts and a £45 white polo shirt from sailing label Gill Marine.  She finished the outfit with a pair of £40 white trainers from Superga. But she suffered the ignominy of coming in last with her crew. Yesterday’s race was one of a number of royal events affected by torrential rain on the couple’s visit to the Bahamas. It came as Belize, the country they visited at the start of the eight-day Caribbean tour, became the latest of the Queen’s realms to announce that it was setting up a commission to look at ditching the monarchy.  However, it was the English climate people were talking about yesterday. “Good morning, sorry about this. We’ve brought the weather, haven’t we?” William told his hosts at Sybil Strachan Primary School, in Nassau. The Duchess, now wearing a green dress by Self Portrait and jewellery by Bahamian designer Nadia Irena, addressed an assembly on the troubles of Covid. She said: “One of the hardest things that so many of us found about the pandemic was being separated from the people we love. “We have rediscovered how important our families are, and just how important our friends are.” William and Kate were joined virtually for the event by pupils from across the Bahamas.   Kate told them: “We are thrilled to be in the Bahamas, a country that made us feel at home as soon as we set foot on its soil.” Later the couple spoke to staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau and paid tribute to key workers who had battled through the pandemic. In between the heavy rain showers, they also watched a parade and went on a walkabout. School pupil Maqayro Rolle, 11, said: “It was amazing. It doesn’t matter we are wet.”
