New figures show that motorists are being hit harder than ever before by driving fines, with the average amount of each fine issued also increasing. Some £25million more has been shelled out by motorists over five years than previously recorded. Data collected by Wessex Fleet for the most recent period available between 2015 and 2020 saw different police forces handing out wildly varying numbers of fines. The data also shows that the average cost per fine has increased by £58, meaning that drivers are being hit harder for breaking the law. Dangerous driving was responsible for the largest kind of fine, which carries an average charge of £690 - up £317 from £373 in 2015. On average, drivers who refused to give details to police would expect fines of £636, while insurance offences saw people handed an average £426 penalty.

Different areas of the UK saw large variations in how much drivers are being fined. Drivers in Warwickshire paid the most, handing over £467 on average for being found guilty of a driving-related offence. Northamptonshire drivers paid out £428 per fine, while the West Midlands took third place with an average fine of £413. However some motorists were rather more fortunate, with some police forces handing down substantially smaller average fines than those at the top. In Norfolk, drivers received an average fine almost half the size of those in Warwickshire, at £271. This means that people who commit driving offences in this area are more likely than people anywhere else to have a low price to pay. Motorists in Dyfed-Powys were hit with an average fine of £276 and people in south Wales £280.
