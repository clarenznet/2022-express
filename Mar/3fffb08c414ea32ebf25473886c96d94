Tess Daly, 52, put on a leggy display in an ethereal white gown at the star-studded BAFTA Gala earlier today. This year’s Fundraising Gala Dinner took place at The Londoner Hotel in the capital’s iconic Leicester Square. The Strictly Come Dancing star attended the glamorous event alongside her presenter husband Vernon Kay. The pair looked fantastic as they took to the red carpet together and exchanged smiles with each other. Tess showed off her endless toned legs in a white asymmetrical gown that accentuated her shoulders and waistline. She complemented the look with a brown smokey eye and berry lip, while keeping the jewellery minimal wearing a thin gold necklace and matching hoop earrings. Vernon opted for a classic navy suit and turtleneck combination, with his hair combed to the side.
