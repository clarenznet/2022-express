   Loose Women star Stacey Solomon was both amused and confused by a series of bizarre outfit comparisons yesterday. The former X Factor finalist couldn’t seem to get her head round “why she enjoyed” a particularly quirky Twitter thread dedicated to her sense of style.     In an odd turn of events, Stacey’s clothes were laid out on Twitter in a side-by-side comparison with various household cleaning products. Stacey, 32, seemed to take it all in her stride, admitting that she rather “enjoyed” the comparison, in view of her 1.5 million followers. Yesterday, Twitter user Pandamoanimum shared an interesting thread with her 81,700 followers. Amanda captioned it: “Stacey Solomon as household cleaning products. A thread.” READ MORE: Mark Labbett says The Chase USA dropped him for 'no reason'      What followed was a series of photos of Stacey wearing various colourful outfits besides different cleaning products. In one pic, Stacey wore a bright orange jumper next to a bottle of Mr Muscle.

She could also be seen posing in glamorous outfits beside bottles of Persil, Comfort fabric conditioner, and various products from the Method brand.     Stacey was clearly tickled by the thread, writing: “Why did I enjoy this so much?” with three laughing emojis. Amanda replied: “Well the plan was that you’d enjoy it, and I thought cleaning products might resonate with you.” “I love it thank you must have taken ages,” Stacey responded gratefully. Amanda wrote back: “Really glad you like it. READ MORE...
