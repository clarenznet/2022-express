Scotland Yard appealed to playboy Farouk Abdulhak following a breakthrough in the probe into the 2008 murder of Martine Vik Magnussen. Martine, 23, from Norway, was found dead in a basement in London's Westminster after celebrating the end of exams with friends. She had been raped and strangled. Abdulhak, now 35, fled to Egypt and then to Yemen within hours of her murder. It has no extradition treaty with the UK. Yesterday, detectives revealed a woman in her 60s had been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Eastwood said Martine's family had been informed and described the arrest as a "positive step". He added: "Most importantly, Farouk Abdulhak should be 'Wanted man'...aware that this matter has not, and will not, go away." "My team and I will continue to seek justice and use all opportunities available to pursue him and bring him back to the UK." "His status as a wanted man will remain and we will not cease in our efforts to get justice for Martine's family. I'm appealing to Farouk Abdulhak directly: Come back to the UK. Come back to face justice." He added: "Since Martine's death, her family has shown true determination, together with my investigation team, as we want to provide some closure for Martine's family." She and other students from Regent's Business School, including Abdulhak, were celebrating at the Maddox nightclub in Mayfair. She was last seen with Abdulhak, a Yemeni citizen and son of a billionaire sugar magnate, in the early hours of March 14. Her body was found two days later partially concealed by rubble. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as compression to the neck. An inquest in November 2010 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Previously, Martine's father, Odd Petter Magnussen, described Abdulhak as a coward.
