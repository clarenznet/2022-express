The panel is made up of Tory MP Damian Hinds, Labour's Lisa Nandy, comedian Dom Joly, Mark Serwokta from PCS Union and Spectator journalist Kate Andrews, and they will be joining host Fiona Bruce from Reading at 10.35 pm. One Twitter user said they have “given up” watching, accusing the show of having “no real debate, just Government bashing with no insight generated”. Another user echoed this view, saying: “What a dreadful panel. What the hell has Dom Jolly or Kate Andrews got to do with the dreadful state of our country. I’m out, won’t be watching again.” One even said: “The only honest guest is a comedian.” Another Twitter user added: “Scraping the barrel this week, think I'll give it a miss.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
