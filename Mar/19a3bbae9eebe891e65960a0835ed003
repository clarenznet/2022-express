The number of virus patients on wards in England has increased. It stood at 9,163 yesterday, up from 8,402 a week earlier. Scientists said it may also be fuelled by people mixing more after curbs were lifted. The latest round of the React-1 testing study showed infections had fallen since the peak of the Omicron wave but remained very high last month. Swab tests from 95,000 volunteers in England showed one in 35 people had Covid between February 8 and March 1. This was down from one in 23 in January but still the second-highest prevalence in 18 rounds of the study since it launched in 2020. Study director Professor Paul Elliott of Imperial College London said: "It's encouraging infections have been falling, but they are still very high and the possibility that they are rising in older adults may be cause for concern. "The good news is that this is a highly vaccinated group. However, a high number of infections will lead to more people becoming ill." He added that more mixing between age groups has meant "older people are more exposed". There are plans for an extra round of booster doses for the over-75s and clinically vulnerable, due to begin in April. Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, agreed a rise in cases was inevitable after restrictions were lifted. He said: "If you create or allow conditions for the virus to spread, that is what it will do. It cannot simply be wished away. "Whether the UK sees hospitalisations like we have seen previously and whether admissions result in a higher proportion going to ICU remains to be seen. It's the latter that will be important as it's something of a bottleneck." The React-1 study showed case rates were highest among children aged five to 11, with one in 21 infected. A further 67,159 cases were reported across the UK yesterday and 123 deaths.
