Manchester United could risk angering Erik ten Hag in their search for a permanent manager after it emerged that a second and final round of interviews are reportedly set to be held. It was claimed earlier this week that the Dutchman was ‘stunned’ after not being handed the job after his first interview with the Old Trafford hierarchy.  United are yet to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s replacement five months after the club icon was sacked. Ralf Rangnick was placed in interim control of the first team until the end of the season. PSG capitulated in their European tie against Real Madrid, losing 3-2 after leading 2-0 three-quarters of the way through the two-legged clash. The Parisians are widely understood to not be too concerned if Pochettino departs, although they must pay £16.8million should they sack the Argentine. Meanwhile, there are reportedly concerns among the United hierarchy that Ten Hag lacks the experience of managing a big club, despite leading the race with Pochettino and the mystery candidate. Ten Hag has enjoyed success with Ajax but aside from a stint with Bayern Munich II, has not coached outside the Eredivisie.
