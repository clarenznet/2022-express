Venus Williams, 41, appeared to suffer a wardrobe malfunction after one of the cameras broadcasting the 2022 Academy Awards panned to her. The legendary tennis star opted for a show-stopping white Elie Saab gown that she paired with silver accessories. The dress featured a plunging neckline that reached half way down her stomach. However, the top appeared to shift slightly to the left, uncovering her nipple. The sports star was watching actor Will Smith’s acceptance speech for Best Actor as the accidental exposure happened. During the brief moment the camera panned to her, she appeared to be trying to keep her neckline up by crossing her arms. Venus was accompanied by her sister Serena, who opted for a pink long-sleeved gown with black sequin details.
