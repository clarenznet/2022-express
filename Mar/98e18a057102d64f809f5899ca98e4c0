The Duke of Sussex was spotted at the Stockyards Rodeo event where animals are "made to perform", according to one source. The source told the Daily Mail: "It's a quintessentially American event. Given he has such a lack of respect for the first amendment and his wife is such an animal rights activist - it is shocking he thought he could show his face here."Meghan is a keen advocate for animal activism and reportedly talked the Duke out of the annual Boxing Day hunt in 2017.
