Max Verstappen clinched his first race victory of the new Formula One season after holding off Charles Leclerc to win the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in dramatic fashion on Sunday evening. The Red Bull driver was engaged in a titanic battle with his Ferrari rival during the final few laps of the race but managed to stay ahead after moving into the lead with just a few laps remaining to claim the spoils late on. Leclerc led for the vast majority of the contest after taking advantage of pole-sitter Sergio Perez's misfortune, with the Mexican driver letting his advantage slip after pitting just before the safety car was deployed in the early stages of the race. The Ferrari man looked set to claim a second Grand Prix victory in as many weeks before he was overtaken by Verstappen but still managed to pick up an extra championship point by setting the fastest lap on the streets of Jeddah. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton managed to secure a 10th-placed finish despite starting from all the way down in 15th to claim a single point after a spirited drive from the seven-time world champion. He pulled off a number of exciting moves over the course of the race and did well to make up some lost ground but was still unable to beat his new Mercedes team-mate George Russell, who crossed the line in fifth place to seal a respectable finish.
