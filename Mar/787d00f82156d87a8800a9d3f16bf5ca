Sonos CEO Patrick Spence has confirmed that Sonos will not be launching any all-new products for months. That's a blow for fans who were hoping to see the smart audio brand enter new product categories as soon as possible. Whispers have swirled for months that Sonos has designed a pair of wireless headphones with active noise-cancellation to compete with the likes of the Apple AirPods Max, Bose 700 Series, and Sony WH-1000XM4. CEO Patrick Spence has confirmed to investors that Sonos will be “focused on launching new products in our existing product categories" for the rest of the financial year. Since headphones would constitute a new product for the US brand, it won't happen before October 2022. That's quite a long wait. That said, there's still plenty for Sonos fans to be excited about. Since the statement from CEO Patrick Spence, Sonos has revealed a new product – the Sonos Roam SL. As the name suggests, this pocketable speaker has the same rugged design, water-resistant case, and the ability to switch between Wi-Fi streaming and Bluetooth. The only difference between the Sonos Roam and Sonos Roam SL is the latter ditches the far-field microphone array that enables hands-free smart assistants like Alexa. It is also £20 cheaper. With months to go before the end of Sonos' financial year, we're likely to see even more refreshed hardware from the firm. Could we see a lower cost soundbar with support for Dolby Atmos for those who don't have £899 to spend on the Sonos Arc? A rebooted Sonos Five with a far-field microphone array to enable Google Assistant and Alexa? Whatever the firm has up its sleeve, Express.co.uk will have all of the news as soon as it breaks. So stay tuned.
