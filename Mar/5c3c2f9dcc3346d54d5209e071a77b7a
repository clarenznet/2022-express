National Highways said that the clockwise carriageway at Junction 3 of the motorwayÂ would remain closed due to "infrastructure defect". Engineers had advised that the damage would require "protracted" repair work, owing to the closure.  Images of the junction show a split in the road surface. National Highways South East said at around 4.30pm today (Monday) that "specialist engineers" were en route and that a diversion had been established using the entry and exit slip roads. An hour later, it added: "Engineers have advised that due to the nature of the damage to the carriageway, a permanent repair will be needed to make safe for traffic to use." This, National Highways said, "will be protracted" and so the closure would remain in place until at least 6am tomorrow morning (Tuesday).   According to KentOnline, as of 6.30pm there were tailbacks reaching 11 miles, however National Highways now says these have been cleared. Motorists are advised to allow extra time for journeys through the affected stretch of road. Junction 3 of the M25 is the intersection with the A20 outside of Swanley.   To make matters worse, Highways England reported a broken down vehicle between Junctions 2 and 3 going clockwise, which as of 7.20pm meant traffic was at a standstill. There is also a planned closure of the M25, from Junction 1a to Junction 3, from 10pm tonight to 5am tomorrow morning, National Highways said.
