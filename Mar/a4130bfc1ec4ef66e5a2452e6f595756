She has also portrayed Sally Boothe in the ITV drama series Where the Heart Is, and Valerie Holden in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks. After a hiatus from the show, Emmerdale producers asked Samantha to return in 2021, which she accepted, and her comeback scenes aired on May 27. The actress personally identifies as a “white witch” and claims she met husband Sean Pritchard “in another life” when she was a man.      The pair tied the knot in 2010 and share two children together. On a recent episode of the Wonderbirds YouTube show Samantha said: "I do think that, you know, I mean, some of us, this is our first life, but most of us I would imagine have lived before. I feel we have. Yeah, definitely. When asked if she had been involved in any past life regression, she added: "I have years ago, yeah...It was weird really, because I was this man actually, and I’d gone to work on this fairground, and the weird thing is it was before I’d met my husband, but I looked like my husband. "I had black curly hair and the woman that I was marrying, if you like, looked like me now. So when I met my husband, I had this feeling of meeting him when I saw him – ‘I know you, I’ve met you before’. "So it was almost as if we’d looked like each other in another life."
