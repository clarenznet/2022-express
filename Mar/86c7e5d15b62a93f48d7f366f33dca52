During their almost 12 year marriage, the couple had four children, including nine-year-old Theodora Rose, also known as Teddy, and Charlie Valentine, who is seven.  "For a narcissist, it’s a wonderful project because it’s all about me and my life," he joked. “The film is the juicy bits before I lost my testosterone. “The project is a little bit disjointed but is about to be in complete harmony very soon." He added: "I think I am playing me for quite a chunk of the film.” Robbie has been on the lookout for young Australians with the potential to channel Take That vibes, as he needs them to play his former bandmates in the movie. Michael Gracey, who previously directed The Greatest Showman, will also be responsible for Better Man. Meanwhile, Robbie has confessed that his life has recently been tinged by grief, after the death of Shane Warne, with whom he was close. "If you don't love Shane Warne," he asserted, "you're an a***hole."
