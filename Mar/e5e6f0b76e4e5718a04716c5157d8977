George Russell has reacted to Lewis Hamilton's shock exit from Q1 with the seven-time champion set to start the race 16th. Hamilton struggled for grip on his flying laps and missed out on getting into Q2 for the first time since 2017. Meanwhile, Russell will start the race sixth.  Russell said: “We are one team and as a team it was not a good day. We don’t have a handle on the car at the moment, it's been a bit inconsistent and we’re fighting this very small window. "On our side of the garage we are managing it inside that window, don;t really know wy or how. On Lewis’ side they didn’t manage to get it inside that window. You take the positives but equally it doesn’t help us in the long run. “We are not here to fight for P5, P6, we want more and we were nine-tenths behind Checo today.  We've got work to do.” READ MORE: Lewis Hamilton apologises to Mercedes team after qualifying nightmare   When pushed on why Russell was so far ahead of Hamikton, he said “it’s just confidence” He added: “I've been in that position when I went out and had no confidence in the car on  circuit like this.
