Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel has erupted at repeated press conference questions over Roman Abramovich following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Blues are owned by Russian billionaire Abramovich, who is alleged to be an associate of President Vladimir Putin.  Abramovich made a rare public statement on Saturday, telling fans that he planned to pass on the ‘stewardship’ of the Premier League club to trustees of the Chelsea charitable foundation. “It is a bit too much for me to answer,” Tuchel told one journalist at his Tuesday media briefing. “Honestly, I can only repeat [what I’ve already said]. I feel bad to repeat it because I have never experienced war.  He said: “During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities. "I have always taken decisions with the club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. “That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. “I believe that currently, they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans.”
