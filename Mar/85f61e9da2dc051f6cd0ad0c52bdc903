For both men and women, the state pension age is currently 66 years old, and between 2026 and 2028 each will rise to 67 years old. Under the current plan, the state pension age is scheduled to rise to 68 years old between 2044 and 2046, which would affect those born on or after April 1977. Yet this could happen as soon as 2037 due to life expectancy, the costs of an ageing population and state pension as well as labour market trends. UK campaign organisation for senior citizens Silver Voices is calling for the Government to scrap the next state pension age rise. Dennis Reed, director of Silver Voices said that until stronger age discrimination measures are introduced in the employment sector, there is a real danger that older workers “will continue to be cast off in their late fifties and early sixties”. He said: “With the cost-of-living crisis likely to worsen and lengthen as result of the war in Europe, older people need threats of a rise in the state pension age like a kick in the teeth. “Millions of people in their late fifties and early sixties already find themselves unable to work, either through ill-health or age discrimination by employers, and have to eke out the time until their state pension on benefits and whatever savings they have. “Accelerated rises in the State Pension age would return state retirement policy to the era when older people were considered lucky to receive the state pension for a couple of years before they died”. The state pension is currently worth up to £179.60 a week, or £9,339.20 a year, but this amount will rise to £185.15 from April 2022, providing an extra £288.60 each year. The Government’s review of the state pension age is ongoing and will be published by May 7, 2023. So what do YOU think? Should the pension age rise or stay at 66?
