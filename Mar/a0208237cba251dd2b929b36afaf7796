The set of irons Tiger Woods used during his ‘Tiger Slam’ haul between 2000 and 2001, have been listed for auction and are set to smash golf memorabilia sale records. Woods used the Titleist set when winning four major titles on the bounce across two seasons, which resulted in the birth of the phrase ‘Tiger Slam’. The clubs that produced arguably the greatest performances in the sport’s history are now up for sale for the first time since 2010. Twelve years ago, Todd Brock was the man to purchase them, after paying £43,420 ($57,242). Now, though, the iron set is set to smash auction records with some predicting this time around the sale could exceed over one million dollars (£758,415). Golden Age Auctions is the company in charge of the sale, and current bidding at the time of writing sits at a cool £212,373 ($280,000) with 16 days left. The auction site is no stranger to selling some of Woods’ prized possessions, having sold one of his iconic back-up 2002 Scotty Cameron putters last year. The sale last year set the winning bidder back a cool £298,000 ($393,000) for a piece of golfing history. JUST IN: Tiger Woods drops Masters 2022 hint as fans notice field inclusion The current record sale for golf memorabilia came with the sale of Horton Smith’s Masters green jacket. The two-time Masters winner’s iconic prize sold for £517,354 ($682,000) back in 2013. Woods’ super set is expected to trump this though, according to Golden Age founder Ryan Carey. Carey said: “I do wonder if [the irons] will be the first golf collectible to break the $1 million mark. “It’s not like there are many people collecting used iron sets, as it’s just not feasible, so it’s hard to know the market. These aren’t exactly baseball cards.” DON'T MISSHenrik Stenson announced as Europe Ryder Cup captain as Donald and Karlsson miss outRory McIlroy felt 'punch drunk' after snapping golf club in fit of rage at 'crazy' courseBrooks Koepka makes Saudi Super League admission as ‘everyone talks about money' The expected sale price is a far cry from Brock’s purchase of just over £43,000 12 years ago, and auction owner Carey admitted he had been trying tirelessly to get the Houston business man to relist them in an effort to ‘break records’. He added: “The $57,000 number sounds extremely low now, but that was a low point for sports memorabilia and a low point for Tiger Woods memorabilia. “I’ve been trying to get these back ever since, and I finally convinced Todd to let me sell them just for history’s sake. He doesn’t need the money, and I told him this will break records.”
