His mother died when he was six and he was cared for by a nanny and her husband, a stonecutter, near a marble quarry owned by his father. It was here he made his first steps towards sculpting. Sent to Florence to study grammar, he showed more interest in copying artworks and learning from other artists.  Florence, under patrons like the Medicis, was the centre of the artistic world. Aged 13 he was an apprentice to the master in Renaissance frescoes Domenico Ghirlandaio. Political upheaval in Florence saw him leave for Venice, Bologna and later Rome, where he sculpted The Pietà - Mary cradling the body of Christ. Now in St Peter's Basilica, it was immediately hailed as a masterpiece in sculpting. Michelangelo was just 24. By 1499 he was back in Florence and in 1504 completed the Statue of David, a 17ft depiction of Goliath's conqueror. The Florentines saw it as a representation of the city's civil liberties and it stood in the public square outside the seat of government, glowering towards Rome. The following year he began work on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, on the commission of Pope Julius II. At its centre are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, most famously the Creation of Adam. German writer Goethe latest said of the fresco: "Without having seen the Sistine Chapel one can form no appreciable idea of what one man is capable of achieving." In 1546 Michelangelo took over as architect to complete St Peter's, designing the dome of the Basilica. He died in 1564, before its completion, aged 88. At his wish he was buried in his beloved Florence.  1951: Trial begins in the US of Julius and Ethel Rosenburg, who went on to be convicted and executed for passing atomic secrets to Russia. 1987: Herald of Free Enterprise ferry capsizes, killing 197.
