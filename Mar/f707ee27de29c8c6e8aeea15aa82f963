Glamorous Little Mix star Leigh Anne Pinnock looked immaculate in a barely-there white bandage bralet this evening. She also wore a matching white blazer which hung open as she flashed the flesh and showcased her toned stomach. She paired her outfit with loose-fitting white cargo pants. Leigh Anne dazzled in the stylish all-white outfit. After a decade together, her group, Little Mix, are set to take a break, during which she's likely to continue pursuing new projects. She began venturing into new areas with her acting debut over the festive season last year when she starred as Georgia in the romcom Boxing Day. It has gained attention for being the first-ever British Christmas movie to feature an entirely black cast. The star, who posed confidently on the red carpet at tonight's awards ceremony, has confirmed that her Little Mix bandmates are "very supportive" as "we all just want each other to win". She added to NME: "It's past friendship - it is sisterhood. We’ll be in each other’s eyes forever."
