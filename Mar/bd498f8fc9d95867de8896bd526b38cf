One of the UK’s most notorious prisoner says he cannot wait to taste freedom again. He is now doing daily exercises to ensure he leaves jail in the same shape as he was in when he was imprisoned 40 years ago. In a phone call from jail, Bronson said: “I still smash my press-ups out.  "I’m 70 years old and I can still do 95 press-ups in 30 seconds. "I don’t walk on the yard, I run – sit-ups, press-ups, squats, I love it. “When I go out on the yard that’s my hour of freedom. "I’ve got a big smile, I’m happy.   READ MORE: Diabetes: Do you experience polyuria? The warning sign that strikes 'especially at night'  “It’s looking good, it really is. "I’m closer now to getting out than I have been in 30-odd years. "Up to now, there’s not a date. "But it’s looking like June, July. “I’m the first man in the British Isles to have a public parole hearing. "All these decades I’ve done.” Bronson, a bare-knuckle boxer, has actually changed his name to Charles Salvador. He was first jailed for seven years in 1974, aged 22.  This was for armed robbery. However, more time to his stretch was added due to attacks on guards and fellow prisoners. He was first released in 1987, but was soon back in jail. In total, he has spent over 40 years inside. Mr Bronson also spoke about his belief that Michael Stone, whom he has served time with, was wrongly convicted of killing mother-and-daughter Lin and Megan Russell in Chillenden, Kent, in 1996. Bronson said: “I know Michael Stone. "All these years he’s been in prison, not one day of it has he been on a protection wing. "The reason he hasn’t been on a protection wing is he claims he’s innocent of them murders. "And I believe he is.”
