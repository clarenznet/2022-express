AEMET warns that the largest accumulations are expected in the western third of the region. AEMET warns that with the red alert the meteorological risk is extreme with unusual phenomena of exceptional intensity and with a very high level of risk. An orange alert, raised for Catalonia, signifies an important meterological risk with a certain degree of risk for the population. An orange warning has been given to Lanzarote and extended until Wednesday. Until 5pm on Tuesday the warning for swell will be orange, and from that time until 11am on Wednesday the warning will be yellow.
