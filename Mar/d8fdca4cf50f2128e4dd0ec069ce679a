The Wordle craze shows no sign of slowing down, despite the recent purchase by The New York Times. Millions of people across the world enjoy a game of Wordle each day, although judging by the latest statistics, some places are better than others when it comes to solving the daily Wordle puzzle. A new study conducted by WordTips has revealed which cities and countries are best at solving Wordle puzzles in the fewest guesses possible. The results - which you can see on the leaderboard further down the page - may surprise you. According to the data, the UK is actually the 15th best country at solving Wordle puzzles. The UK has an average score of 3.89, while Sweden tops the chart with an average score of just 3.72. Canada has an average score of 3.90, followed by the US with 3.92. Elsewhere, Germany has an average score of 4.01, while Russia can only manage an average score of 4.10. The study tracks Twitter data to find the countries and cities with the best Wordle scores. In the UK, Bristol is the brainiest city, scoring an average of 3.73, followed by Newcastle with 3.75. London, Edinburgh and Glasgow occupy the third, fourth and fifth spots, while Manchester is ranked 10th within the UK with a score of 4.04. If you're new to Wordle, the game gives players six chances to guess a different five-letter word each day. You'll need to use the process of elimination to uncover the correct answer. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released.
