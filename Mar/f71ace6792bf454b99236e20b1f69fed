Among 350 black and brown staff quizzed, 77.3 percent who challenged it said they were not treated fairly. The Nursing Narratives research, led by Sheffield Hallam University, found a further 59 percent said racism was so bad it was difficult to do their job. Over a third had left a job as a result. More than half said they had experienced unfair treatment in the pandemic in relation to deployment, PPE or risk assessment. Sam, a Filipino nurse who quit the NHS, said: “It was like bullying was part of the system.” Professor Anandi Ramamurthy, at Sheffield Hallam, said: “Racism in the NHS is not new but the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed its fatal impact. This can’t be tolerated.”
