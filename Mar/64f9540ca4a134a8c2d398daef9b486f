Gary Neville has launched yet another brutal attack on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after the leader seemingly compared the horrifying scenes in Ukraine at the moment to Brexit.  Ukraine has been coming under attack from Russia since last month in what has been a horrifying invasion. The first cities to come under fire were Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbass region, although that has now moved on to Kyiv and Mariupol. The war has led to people around the world showing their support for Ukraine, with a number of countries coming to their aid. Ukrainian families have been ripped apart by the war, with many fleeing to neighbouring countries such as Poland. But after Johnson's comments on Saturday, the Prime Minister was berated by many for his inability to show affection to those in danger - with Neville airing his anger. "I know that it is the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom every time," Johnson said on Saturday. "I can give you a couple of recent, famous examples. When the British people voted for Brexit in such large numbers, I don't think they were remotely hostile to foreigners. "It's because they wanted to be free." His words evidently angered Neville, who said that Johnson was a 'disgrace'. "He’s an absolute disgrace to the end!" Neville tweeted on Saturday.  It is not the first time the former Manchester United star had enrolled himself into politics, and he has made his displeasure towards the Conservatives known on more than one occasion. He joined the Labour Party in January after years of interest. “That is purely for myself,” he said. “I want to support Labour. I do believe that we need a progressive Labour party but one that not just looks after the left side … it has to come towards the centre.”
