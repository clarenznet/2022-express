London North Eastern Railway (LNER) notified its 191,700 Twitter followers about the disruption to service earlier this morning. Posting on Twitter at 5:20am, LNER said: "Due to a derailment at Newcastle depot, services are subject to delays and short-notice amendments."  The update was accompanied by an image which warned disruption was likely at services between Edinburgh Waverley and York. Newcastle and Sunderland were also identified as areas affected by the depot derailment. LNER later added two more posts to update Brits on how they can use the network.
