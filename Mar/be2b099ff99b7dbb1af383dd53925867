Since stepping back from royal duties two years ago, Meghan and Harry have been raising their two children Archie, now two, and Lilibet, nine months, in California. Before stepping back, Prince Harry interviewed Dr Jane Goodall, for Vogue magazine – Meghan co-edited that month’s issue of the magazine and Archie was four months old at the time. In discussion with Dr Goodall, Harry brought up his environmental sensitivities, views towards parenthood and the responsibilities towards new generations. He said in September 2019: “It does make it different. I think, weirdly, because of the people that I’ve met and the places that I’ve been fortunate enough to go to, I’ve always had a connection and a love for nature. “I view it differently now, without question.” He continued: “But I’ve always wanted to try and ensure that, even before having a child and hoping to have children…” Ms Goodall rushed to add, laughing: “Not too many!” And Prince Harry replied: “Two, maximum!” He continued: “But I’ve always thought: this place is borrowed. “And, surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation." If Harry still holds the same view two and a half years later, it is unlikely that the couple will have more children. However, he may have reviewed this position. So what do YOU think?
