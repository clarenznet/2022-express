Good Morning Britain's Jonathan Swain talked to viewers from Lille, where a pop-up centre for visa applications is supposed to be. He described the hopelessness some refugees feel about getting into Britain as he described how he has been helping out where he can because nobody is representing Britain in the effort to assist those fleeing the war zone. "The British charities aren't really here, no one from the Home Office, border force is really here," Jonathan explained. "There was a couple of blokes at the port in Calais so people are asking us. We're kind of representing Britain as journalists at the moment." He detailed ways in which he has supported those who need help, adding: "I've tried to do what I can for these families because they need help and it's not crossing a line, they just need to borrow a phone to get some data." He described the lack of British support as "pretty appalling". MORE TO FOLLOW...
