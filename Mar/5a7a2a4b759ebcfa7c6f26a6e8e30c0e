Royal commentator Richard Eden insisted that both the Duke of Sussex and Prince Andrew should both lose their roles as Counsellors of State. The position means they could act in the Queen's place if she cannot carry out official duties due to illness or absence abroad. Prince Charles and Prince William are also Counsellors of State, but Mr Eden raised fears as they are currently both away on royal tours, meaning it is only Harry and Andrew left. He said: "This is why #PrinceAndrew and #PrinceHarry must be stripped of their roles as Counsellors of State immediately. #royal." Mr Eden was responding to royal expert Peter Hunt, who tweeted: "Both Charles and William are abroad. If the Queen becomes ill, either Charles flies home or Andrew steps in – an unthinkable move for many. This is the reality of having no foolproof plan to cover all scenarios for when a 95-year-old head of state can’t carry out her duties." Harry is living in California after quitting as a working royal, meanwhile the Duke of York stepped back from public duties following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES:
