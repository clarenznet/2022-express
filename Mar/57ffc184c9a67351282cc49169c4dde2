Debuting in DC Comics back in 1939, Batman has been adapted in live-action many times. Aside from early serials and Adam West’s big-screen version of the Batman TV series, the first proper blockbuster take on the Dark Knight arguably kicked off in 1989. Here are the Batman movies in order, who played the Caped Crusader and which main villains featured in each outing. Michael Keaton Batman (1989) - The JokerBatman Returns (1992) – The Penguin, CatwomanThe Flash (2022) – ?Batgirl (2022) – ? Val Kilmer Batman Forever (1995) – Two-Face, The Riddler George Clooney Batman and Robin (1997) – Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane Christian Bale Batman Begins (2005) – Ra’s al Ghul, Scarecrow, Carmine FalconeThe Dark Knight (2008) – The Joker, Two-FaceThe Dark Knight Rises (2012) – Bane, Talia al Ghul, Scarecrow Ben Affleck Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) – Superman (sort of), Lex Luthor, DoomsdaySuicide Squad (2016) [cameo] – The Joker, Harley QuinnJustice League (2017) – SteppenwolfZack Snyder’s Justice League (2021) [recut of the latter] – Steppenwolf, DarkseidThe Flash (2022) – ? Robert Pattinson The Batman – The Ridder, The Penguin, Carmine Falcone, The Joker NB: The Batman is set in a different universe to the other movies and so you don’t need to watch anything else prior. Think of it like the debut of a new James Bond. Meanwhile, The Flash will include both Keaton and Affleck reprising their Bruce Wayne in a multiverse movie. Perhaps, other former Batman stars could feature or maybe even R-Batz, in cameo roles. On top of this Keaton's will also feature in HBO Max movie Batgirl later this year. The Batman is out now.
