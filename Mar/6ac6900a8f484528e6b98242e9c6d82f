She joined Lyons' management trainee scheme in 1952 and was based in the statistical office. LEO was created by the British catering company, a technology pioneer, to create back-office efficiency for its orders to tea shops, hotels and restaurants. Mary Blood, as she was then known, was intelligent and mathematically gifted.   When a memo advertising a "computer appreciation course" circulated the office, she applied - the only woman among the 10 applicants. Mary's first job was to create test programmes for LEO, which was unreliable and occupied 5,000 sq ft at Lyons' headquarters in Hammersmith, west London. She then worked on automated payslips for the payroll's 10,000 employees. It was slow and painstaking work. "A modern computer has a huge store of umpteen gigabytes. LEO 1 was 2k," she explained. Coombs replicated her duties for the Ford Motor Company. She also worked on early payroll programmes for the British Army, Met Office and Inland Revenue. Mary Clare Coombs was born in Muswell Hill, north London, the daughter of doctorWilliam - Lyons' company's medical officer - and his wife Ruth (n√©e Petri).
