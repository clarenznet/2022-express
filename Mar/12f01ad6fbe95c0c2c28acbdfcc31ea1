It is likely to dwarf the 2015 migration crisis in its scope. Russia’s invasion could bring about the biggest movement of people in Europe since the end of the second world war when 12 million Europeans were displaced.  Janez Lenarcic, the EU’s Slovenian crisis management commissioner, said it will be the worst European humanitarian crisis for decades. He said: “We are witnessing what could become the largest humanitarian crisis on our European continent in many, many years.” According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, around half a million Ukrainians have left the country for countries to the west. So far Poland has received 160,000 refugees, which is the largest number.  Polish authorities are bracing themselves to receive 1.5 million refugees over the course of the crisis. That is equivalent to the population of Warsaw. Around 127,000 are thought to have left for Russia from the Russian occupied South East of Ukraine. According to The Times, Ukrainian authorities estimate as many as 4 million people out of a population of 44 million could leave the country.

She said: “The figures that we’re seeing are really astounding. “Something of this proportion, we haven’t seen it in recent times.” Currently, most of the refugees are women and children.  All Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 have been banned from leaving the country and instructed to fight Russian forces by President Zelensky.
