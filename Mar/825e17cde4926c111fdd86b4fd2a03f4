Good luck with Wordle 266 on March 12, and check back on Sunday for new hints for the next Wordle puzzle. Chances are you already know how to play Wordle, but if you are new to the game, here's how it works. The game begins with an empty grid, and players are given six chances to figure out a different five-letter word each day. When you guess a word, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. If you really want a challenge, Wordle features a hard mode, which bans players from guessing letters that have already been ruled out. It's a fantastic game, although if you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Read on for the Wordle 266 hints for March 12...
