Many Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits and payments like state pension will see their rates increase next month, but so will energy bills, National Insurance and inflation. Concerns are spreading that the real value of the 3.1 percent increases in benefits and payments will not be enough to keep the most vulnerable age groups afloat during the cost of living crisis.   The new state pension rates will be increasing from £179.60 to £185.15 per week in April. To be eligible for a new state pension, retirees must be born on or after April 6, 1951 if they are a man or on or after April 6,1953 if they are a woman. Additionally, they need 35 qualifying years worth of National Insurance contributions to get the full amount, and at least 10 to receive a portion of it.

Men born before April 6,1951 and women born before April 6, 1953 are eligible for the full basic state pension if they have 30 qualifying years of NI contributions or credits. The triple lock was put in place to ensure state pension payments would rise each year by the biggest of three UK figures: inflation, earnings increases or 2.5 percent.  However, this mechanism was suspended, with the reason being that the pandemic had caused an unprecedented skewing of these three figures which would mean a rise of over eight percent in line with wage increases. A double lock replaced the triple lock, ensuring state pension payments would increase by either inflation or 2.5 percent, which resulted in the current 3.1 percent increase due next month. However, since these increases were confirmed last year, inflation has skyrocketed with an expected seven or eight percent to hit in April, which would mean pensioners essentially face a real-value loss in their payments of roughly £486.20 for the 2022 to 2023 financial year. Women who derive their qualifying years from their spouse or civil partner’s NI contributions, also known as a Category B pension, will see an increase from £82.45 to £85.  The over-80 pension will also increase from £82.45 to £85. This pension is a non-contributory based pension, but Britons must be receiving a basic state pension less than this amount or no state pension at all in order to claim it. The maximum additional state pension, which is an extra amount payable on top of a basic state pension, is rising from £180.31 to £185.90.  Britons that reached state pension age before April 6, 2016 and claimed basic state pension should automatically receive additional state pension. Pension Credit provides a range of pension income top ups for those on low income and over the state pension age, which includes the likes of additional payments for carers, savings credit and children additions. All aspects of Pension Credit rates are increasing, with the standard minimum guarantee from 177.10 to £182.60 for individuals and £270.30 to £278.70 for couples.
