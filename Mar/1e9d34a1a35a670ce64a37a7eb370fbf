With 25 James Bond themes over the last 60 years, the 007 franchise has an impressive back catalogue. But no one has performed more than Dame Shirley Bassey. After her iconic debut with Goldfinger, the Welsh legend went on to perform Diamonds Are Forever and Moonraker. Now BAFTA have announced Dame Shirley will be performing one of them at the 75th EE British Academy Film Awards next Sunday March 13. Her live performance will open the ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate the 007 film franchise’s 60th anniversary. However, which of her three Bond themes she’ll be singing remains totally under wraps. Our best bet would be Goldfinger as it’s probably the most well-known and best-loved of all the 007 songs. Although, given that Diamond marks a 60th anniversary, perhaps she’ll go with Diamonds Are Forever.
