This morning, on Saturday, the Government posted an update urging its citizens living in Russia to “consider leaving by remaining commercial routes”. It stressed flying directly to the UK may not be possible, warning travel plans will likely need to be amended. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: “We advise against all travel to the whole of Russia.” This was “due to the lack of available flight options to return to the UK, and the increased volatility in the Russian economy”. The department added: “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes.” It cited as reasons for its advice fresh restrictions on the publishing and distribution of news and the falling value of the Ruble. On the current difficulties of travelling straight from Russia to the UK, it said: “Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider. “Connecting flights, largely via the Middle East and Turkey are operational for travel from Russia to the UK and other destinations.” Those nationals in need of consular assistance have been advised to call the British Embassy in Moscow and to select the option for the assistance. This can be done by calling +7 (8) 495 956 7200. More to follow.
