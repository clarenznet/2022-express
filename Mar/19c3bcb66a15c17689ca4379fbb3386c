Any unpaid cares who make a claim before April 11 could be eligible for a £237.90 bonus in June. The Scottish Government released figures showing that over 658,000 Carer’s Allowance Supplement payments have been made to 126,055 people since the bi-annual bonus was first introduced in September 2018.  Carer's Allowance Supplement is an extra payment for people in Scotland who get Carer’s Allowance from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Just under 82,000 eligible claimants received a double payment of £462.80 in December, 2021 in recognition of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on unpaid carers. There are two qualifying dates for receiving the cash boost. The two dates have been confirmed, and deadlines to make a claim will be Monday, April 11 and Monday, October 10, 2022.

That is why we also paid an additional Coronavirus Carer’s Allowance Supplement Payment in 2020 and 2021.” He added: “The Scottish Government’s additional payments meant that eligible carers in Scotland received up to £694.20 more in support last year than carers in the rest of the UK.” With April fast approaching, Britons are urged to see if they can claim this benefit. With the rising cost of energy, and the cost of living crisis, any bonus could be seen as vital as people struggle to pay bills. Britons may be eligible for Carer's Allowance if they or the person they care for and the type of care they provide meets certain criteria. The person cared for must already get one of these benefits: If two people care for one person, only one of them can claim Carer’s Allowance. People need to spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone. This can include: Claimants must be 16 and over, and not in full time education. Their earnings should be £128 or less a week after tax, National Insurance and expenses. Britons can make a claim on the Gov.uk website, or they can call 0800 731 0297 for a form.
