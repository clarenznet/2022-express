Darci Topping was also quizzed about the dad, a Manchester employment tribunal heard. The 23-year-old was on minimum wage for 37 hours a week but was pressured into cutting that to 20 as Covid hit - and made redundant out of the blue by line manager Zara Costello, the tribunal was told. Bosses at Stepping Stones nursery in Hoddlesden, Lancs, sacked her in a sham process because she was pregnant, the tribunal ruled. Judge Marion Batten said: "The decision to make her redundant was a decision targeted at her." Ms Topping, from Blackburn, whose son Stanley is now one, was awarded Â£25,646 after she won her case for pregnancy discrimination and unfair dismissal.
