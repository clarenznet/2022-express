Jude Bellingham is expected this week to have the chance to show the growing maturity in his game that playing in the Bundesliga has brought - as well as maybe his sharp tongue. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder is set to be used by England manager Gareth Southgate in both friendly games against Switzerland on Saturday and the Ivory Coast on Tuesday as the build up hots up to this summer’s Nations League group games and the World Cup finals in Qatar. But it is an international break that might also give the Dortmund dressing room a break from the demands of the ebullient, increasingly confident 18 year old. Dortmund coach Marco Rose has played down the outbursts that have reportedly caused friction between Bellingham and his club teammates - and insisted that the England teenager needs that edge to his game. With the news breaking this week that the UK and Ireland are set to be named as the joint hosts of Euro 2028, by which time Bellingham could be at his peak as a player at 24, it may well be the time for the former Birmingham starlet to start staking his claim for a future in England’s midfield. He won’t be quiet about it - that is for sure. Bellingham, who will not turn 19 until June, has ten caps so far for the Three Lions - Wayne Rooney got to the ten mark quicker at 18 and three months -  but has now registered ten goals and 17 assists in 83 games for Dortmund, after joining them in a £25 million deal from Birmingham just over a year ago for £25m. But there have been a series of bust ups this season - including a sweary outburst at fullback Nico Schulz as his team went out of the Europa League to Rangers, when cameras caught the English youngster raging: “You can’t get one f****** pass off, you’re f******* s***. Every f****** time!” Then there was an on field row which continued into the dressing rooms with Belgium’s Alex Witsel - 14 years his senior - after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Augsberg. But Rose defended his young hot head, saying: “Where Jude comes from, you possibly speak a bit more rough in English. “That’s part of it. Jude wants to win games, he’s angry – and that’s part of him as a player and something we actually need even more.” Liverpool and Manchester United were both expected to be bidding strongly for Bellingham this summer - but the youngster has reportedly told Dortmund that he is happy in Germany and wants to stay for at least another year - so a prospective £100 million move back to England looks to be off the cards for the moment. Bellingham does not have a release clause in his Dortmund contract, which runs out in 2025. But the English youngster is despite his fiery nature already considered a leader at Dortmund - often being handed the key holding role in midfield - by Rose, but equally used in his more familiar, ranging box to box role.
