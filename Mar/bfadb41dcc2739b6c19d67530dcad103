Max Verstappen moaned about his Ferrari rival's rear lights while hunting him down in the opening stages. He said: “The lights of [Charles] Leclerc don't work on the back of his car. Yeah they don't work.”  However, F1’s rear lights do not determine when a car is braking. Instead, they simply show when the car is harvesting energy. The lights are a regulation so it is likely Verstappen was mentioning it to raise awareness to the stewards. Verstappen overtook Carlos Sainz at the start of the race to jump into third, behind Leclerc.

Of course I’m not happy with fourth and we’ll analyse what happened but we have a competitive car and we have a lot to fight for tomorrow as a team. I am looking forward to it, hopefully we can have a good race.”
