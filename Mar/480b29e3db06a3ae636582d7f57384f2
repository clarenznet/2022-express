Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced the deployment of the Sky Sabre, along with 100 troops, yesterday. Sky Sabre, which will be under UK control, can direct 24 missiles hitting separate targets at the same time. It can hit a tennis ball-sized object travelling several times faster than the speed of sound. During a visit to Warsaw, Mr Wallace said: "It is very right that Britain stands by Poland, as Poland carries much of the burden of the consequence of this war and stands tall and brave to stand up to the threats from Russia."  Downing Street said sending the Sky Sabre system was about "supporting the Polish armed forces at the request of the Polish government". Nato has pledged to send more troops to defend its eastern flank, following Russia's strike on a Ukrainian military base just a few miles from the border with Poland.
