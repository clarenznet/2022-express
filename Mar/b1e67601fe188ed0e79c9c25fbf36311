Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen will renew their bitter on-track rivalry when the five red lights go out to start this afternoon's season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari will be on pole position in the desert ahead of second-placed Verstappen, who was unable to dislodge the Monegasque driver from the top of the order at the end of Saturday's qualifying session. Hamilton will start this afternoon's race from the third row of the grid after only managing to qualify in fifth place, with Mercedes struggling to shake off the troublesome problems that hampered their efforts in pre-season testing. The Silver Arrows are still working hard to solve the 'porpoising' issue that is a by-product of the ground effect on this year's new cars and has left them well adrift of their Constructors' Championship rivals at this early stage. Meanwhile, Ferrari and Red Bull look to be in the ascendancy after snapping up each of the four highest-placed grid positions on Saturday. Leclerc and Verstappen will be closely followed off the line by third-placed Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez in fourth when the action finally gets underway at 3pm.
