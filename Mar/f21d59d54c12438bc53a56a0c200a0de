Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis demanded a “crackdown” over disproportionate demands, even for those in credit. He told the business, energy and industrial strategy committee that “there is no reason”, it is “not mathematically sound and it’s a breach of licence conditions”. Mr Lewis said: “I have been very concerned that a number of companies  are doing it to improve their cash flow situation at the expense of their customers and I would like to see the regulator crack down on that quite substantially.” He added: “It’s important to remember that there is no competition in the market any more. This is not a market... no one can switch.” Asked to give examples of firms doing this, Mr Lewis replied: “Anyone with an energy licence. Companies are seeing this price change as an opportunity to crystallise a change in payments. “The amount of playing fast and loose that seems to be going on is huge right now. We need to crack down and we need to be much tougher with firms that do this.” Mr Lewis earlier told the committee that the Government’s current package to help pay the bills of those on the lowest incomes is “not enough”, adding that it “needs to give them more money. It really is as simple as that.” He said: “This is a market-based system, with absolutely zero market, zero competition. “There is nothing meaningfully cheaper than the price cap going on out there at the moment.” Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, also told MPs that energy bill support is “insufficient for the scale of the crisis we’re facing”. She said: “We have to recognise that there are millions of households that are simply unable to cope with the energy bill increases that we’re going to see this year.”
