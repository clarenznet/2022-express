 Earlier this week, the former Good Morning Britain host confirmed he would not be holding back as he gave his Twitter followers an insight into his new chat show. In a new clip shared to his social media accounts, Piers Morgan laid into Prince Harry as he branded the royal a “hypocrite”.         “I liked the old Prince Harry, you know the one who used to get drunk and play naked billiards in Vegas,” Piers ranted. “He was a lot more fun than this po-faced, sanctimonious, virtue-signalling, hypocrite who thinks it’s perfectly ok to quit the country, quit the Royal Family and then make all these demands from his California mansion about all the stuff he still thinks he’s entitled to. "He and his wife are making hundreds of millions of dollars out of fleecing titles bestowed on them by an institution they keep trashing in public. "I think it's a sickening thing that they're doing. I think it's horrible for the Queen and I wish they would stop."

Bob Oberti replied: “About time and welcome back!!” “Well said and all true,” user Royal All Over posted, while Mrs Bird commented: “Bring it on.” “Bravo," Carol simply praised. Earlier in the week, Piers took aim at Good Morning Britain as he shared a teaser for Uncensored. The former Life Stories host claimed he was "forced to leave" the ITV show following his clash with co-star Alex Beresford.  Piers and Alex had a disagreement over Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey. However, shortly after the incident on GMB, Piers made the announcement he was leaving the show. In the trailer for Uncensored, he said: “A year ago today, I was forced to leave a job that I loved at the peak of its success for having the audacity to express an honestly held opinion. “Well, this shouldn’t happen in any democracy supposedly built on the principles of free speech and freedom of expression."

I’m Piers Morgan Uncensored.” Piers left his role on Good Morning Britain on March 9, after his comments about the Duchess of Sussex sparked more than 40,000 Ofcom complaints.    At the time, ITV released a statement confirming Piers would no longer be presenting with Susanna Reid. The statement read: "Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. "ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add."  Piers later confirmed he had also decided to leave his role on ITV’s Life Stories and was later replaced by Kate Garraway.
