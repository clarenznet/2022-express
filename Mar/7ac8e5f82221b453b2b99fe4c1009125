Sharing the moment they first met as she paid tribute to her close pal, Sue added: "I met Maggie when we were Drama students at Bristol University in the 1970's. “We were in a very serious production of Ibsen's The Lady For the Sea but for some reason the audience was on the floor laughing. “A tragedy for Ibsen (he was good at those) but the launch of an epic comedy partnership.     "Our theatre company LipService was officially launched in 1985 and we have written 22 original comedies, touring all over the world, managing to have children in between! "It's notoriously difficult to present new work in theatre and we are really proud that we managed to do so and to build an audience for it. "We are still all in a state of shock as this was very sudden following an accident,” she continued. “We had planned a new digital version of Chateau Ghoul which we had already filmed which will be shared with you later in the year in memory of Maggie, plus some live events using the huge amount of digital footage we thankfully have archived."
