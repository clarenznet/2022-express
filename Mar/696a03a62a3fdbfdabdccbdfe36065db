Sami Chokri claims it infringes "particular lines and phrases" of his 2015 track Oh Why. He added: "I feel like I've been robbed by someone I respect, or respected." Chokri and co-writer Ross O'Donoghue say an "Oh I" hook in Sheeran's song is "strikingly similar" to their "Oh Why" refrain.    Sheeran plus co-authors Steven McCutcheon and John McDaid deny allegations of copying and say they do not remember Oh Why. The High Court trial in London heard from Chokri yesterday. He performs as Sami Switch and calls himself a rapper, poet and singer. He said: "Friends said that the new song by Ed Sheeran sounded incredibly similar to my song Oh Why. I was a passenger in my girlfriend's car and Shape Of You came on the radio. She and I were both shocked to hear the similarities. We said, 'This is what everyone is talking about.'" Chokri said he tried to get Sheeran to listen to his music as he was "inspired" by him. With his management, he wanted to get his EP "to the attention of labels and publishers, and writers and performers, who might support and enhance my career. We discussed getting them to Ed Sheeran and Sticky Studios" where he was recording. Chokri of Reading said Oh Why is the song he is "most proud of". It was not registered with the body that covers royalties until 2017. The trial continues.
