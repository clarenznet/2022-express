The French President will send a "Letter to the French" confirming his candidacy to the April presidential election, according to French media.  Franceinfo reported that Mr Macron would make the announcement on Friday. But news agency AFP claimed the letter would be published on Thursday evening. According to Le Figaro, the President will also post a video for the announcement on social media. This method is far from being unprecedented for the President of the Republic. In March 2019, two months before the European elections, he outlined some of his proposals for the EU in a letter to the 28 member states and the citizens of the continent. After having played the delaying card, due to the health crisis, Emmanuel Macron was once again taken by surprise by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, the initial idea of his candidacy was based on the multiplication of communication channels, thus allowing him to approach a wider audience. According to a source of CNEWS, his role as mediator between the West and Putin will not prevent Emmanuel Macron from campaigning and ensuring "big moments". During his speech on Ukraine on Wednesday evening, Macron said: "This campaign will allow an important democratic debate on the nation, but that will not prevent us from coming together on the essentials." Candidates have until Friday evening to announce their intentions to run in the elections. French voters will head to the poll on April 10. It should be noted that this late candidacy does not seem to affect the president in the polls. According to the latest OpinionWay barometer for CNEWS, Emmanuel Macron has 27% of voting intentions in the first round of the presidential election on 10 April. Additional reporting by Maria Ortega
