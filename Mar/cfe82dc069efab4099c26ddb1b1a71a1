Ukrainian farmers, who are among the world's top producers of wheat, maize, barley and various cooking oils, have abandoned their fields to fight Putin's invaders. The price of diesel has also rocketed as a result of the war, meaning lorry drivers who deliver products to supermarkets might have to pass on costs to consumers. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, said: "Just when you think hell on earth can't get any worse, it does. "So you're going from being a breadbasket to now, literally, having to hand out bread to them. It's just an incredible reverse of reality." Bakery chain Greggs warned that its customers are likely to see the second hike this year as it faces runaway increases in costs. The firm's boss Roger Whiteside said: "We've got no plans to raise prices currently, but obviously that's going to have to remain under review given the way the markets are moving around the world on commodity food prices in particular." Ukrainian trade lawyer Ivanna Dorichenko said her country's farmers have left their fields to fight Russia. Ukraine is referred to as the "breadbasket of Europe" as the fifth largest exporter of wheat, accounting for seven per cent of sales globally in 2019. Ms Dorichenko said: "The men who need to work on the land, they're all defending our land right now. "Because if they do not defend the land, there'll be nothing to work on at a later stage, and you don't have a single person right now who's not trying to help in any way they can." Meanwhile pump prices are reaching new highs every day as the uncertainty over supply of Russian oil and gas continues. Rod McKenzie, managing director at trade body the Road Haulage Association, said: "If hauliers have to pay more for their fuel, they inevitably have to charge customers more. "I suspect this will mean prices going up on everything that is delivered by a truck, which is frankly 97 per cent of everything that we get in Britain."
