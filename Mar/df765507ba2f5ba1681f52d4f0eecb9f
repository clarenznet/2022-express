Spike, a crossbreed who is around five years old, was rescued from a public shelter in Romania and brought to the UK last December by Pawprints to Freedom. But three months after arriving at the charity's kennels in Cheshire, he is still patiently waiting for adopters to pick him. A spokesperson for Pawprints to Freedom said Spike "constantly gets overlooked even though he's super sweet". Spike enjoys walks, treats and getting attention from staff at the kennels. The charity is looking for an adult-only home, although he could live with another dog. The spokesperson said: "Spike is lead tested and walks lovely on the lead. "He enjoys his walks and being outside of his kennel. "Spike likes to make himself heard when he sees another dog on his walks, but does soon calm down and settle enough to continue on his walk. "Spike has been fine with everyone at the kennels and enjoys a quick fuss when it is his time for attention. "Spike loves his food and treats.
