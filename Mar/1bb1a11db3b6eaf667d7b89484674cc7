Her Majesty still hopes to be at Westminster Abbey on March 29 – but aides are thought to be worried that she may not be mobile enough. Buckingham Palace officials said she would not be at the Common-wealth Service at the abbey today – usually a highlight of her year. The monarch, who recently saw off Covid and is 96 next month, is said to have ruled out using a wheelchair. But her problems getting around are believed to have been behind the “regretful” decision to pull out of today’s service, where she will be represented by Prince Charles. The Queen referred to her mobility issues as she received incoming and outgoing Defence Services Secretaries last month, saying: “Good morning. Well, as you can see I can’t move.” Aides said she will continue with other “planned engagements, including in-person audiences”. Plans are reportedly being drawn up to find a way for her to attend the service for her late husband comfortably, such as entering the abbey via a side door to avoid a long walk down the aisle to her seat. Penny Junor, a royal biographer, said: “The Queen is extraordinary. But we have to remember she is 95. “The Queen is fantastic on Zoom calls but I think events where she is required to walk or go up any steps are not going to be feasible any more. “We have the technology that means she is not going to disappear from view altogether.” The service will allow more people to pay their respects to Prince Philip as pandemic curbs limited his funeral last April to 30. Prince Harry will not return from the US for his grandfather’s service. He has begun a legal challenge against the Home Office over his UK security.
