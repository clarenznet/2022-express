Strictly Come Dancing star AJ Odudu has put on a jaw-dropping display in a figure-hugging, sheer dress this evening as she attended the BAFTAs at the Royal Albert Hall. The BAFTA co-host, 34, who hosted the red carpet this evening alongside Tom Allen, wasn't afraid to pose up a storm in the dazzling number. Posing expertly, AJ opted for a revealing black number which hugged her curves in all the right places. The sequined evening gown showcased her incredible figure while leaving little to the imagination. The exquisite garment featured its own black mesh train which trailed elegantly behind AJ as she walked the red carpet. The lower half of the dress skimmed the floor, but it was the top half which garnered the most attention.

However, the star flashed her perfectly toned midriff, chest and arms as she posed for snaps. She added a hint of bling to the outfit with a silver choker, gold earrings and matching bracelets. Complimenting her jewellery, AJ opted for a glowy face of makeup, completed with gold eye shadow which made her brown eyes pop.
