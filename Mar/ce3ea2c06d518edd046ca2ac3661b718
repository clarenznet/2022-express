The Foreign Secretary refused to rule out the UK signing a defence and foreign policy cooperation and integration agreement with the EU when questioned by the foreign affairs committee, opening the possibility that she would enter into it in future. The refusal to deny a move to join forces with the EU has sparked outrage among Leave voters and Brexit advocacy groups. One such group, Get Britain Out, said: “Such a deal would not only make a mockery of the UK’s independence from the EU, but it would severely undermine NATO and effectively bind the UK into any EU army or foreign policy decision. During negotiations on a post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation agreement in 2020, the UK and EU excluded provisions for a pact on continued defence and security.  When pushed on an answer, Ms Truss said: “What I am talking about is much closer working between the EU with NATO and with broader allies as well as us strengthening our additional relationships,” adding she “wouldn’t jump ahead to what those structures may look like”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked calls for unity between Western nations, with Emmanuel Macron stating in a Versailles summit: “Faced with the violence deployed by Russia against Ukraine and its people, we are at a tragic turning point in our history. We are fully aware that it is also a turning point for our societies, our peoples and our European project.” Boris Johnson’s government has come under criticism for not delivering on the Brexit that Leave voters to believe was promised, with Reform UK deputy leader Dr David Bull saying Mr Johnson was “not doing what he said he’d do.” Follow below for LIVE updates...
