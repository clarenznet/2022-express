Bosses at The Sun Inn in Everton, Nottinghamshire, said the family of six tucked into roast dinners, sides and guzzled drinks before walking out the restaurant on Sunday March 13. The pub says it is not the first hospitality business in the area to have been targeted in recent weeks. The family has been reported to police, who it is thought are investigating. A statement on The Sun Inn's Facebook page says: "A heads up to all hospitality venues in the local area. "We had a walk out at lunchtime, a couple with four children. "They have been reported to the police. "Please be careful as we are not the first pub in the area this week." The Sun Inn is an independent pub - a former coaching house - with open log fires and a contemporary interior, Nottinghamshire Live reports.  It comes after another pub in the same county was left "like a bomb site" by two families, who also did a runner without paying. Four adults and their children arrived at The White Horse Inn in Barnby Boor, East Retford, Nottinghamshire, at around 7.30pm on Tuesday March 8. The order rounded up to £330 and the families reportedly vanished without paying at around 9pm. Staff at the pub said the families were intimidating staff while they were there. A photograph taken at the esatablishment shows food and plates strewn over the floor around a large table last week.
