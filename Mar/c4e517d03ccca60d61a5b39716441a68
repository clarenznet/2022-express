Prince Harry did not join other members of the Royal Family at Westminster Abbey today for a memorial service to Prince Philip. A congregation of 1,800 came together to commemorate the legacy of Philip. The Queen, who’s attendance was not guaranteed, put aside her health concerns to honour her late husband. However, Harry and his wife Meghan Markle remained in the US, where they live with their two children.Royal journalist Robert Jobson branded Harry’s absence “disrespectful”, given the Duke of Sussex’s “great relationship” with his grandfather.He told the Royally Obsessed podcast earlier this month: “I’m sure that the Queen knows that Philip and Harry had a great relationship and enjoyed each other’s company.“I think it’s [Harry not returning for the memorial service] disrespectful, personally.” He explained that the Duke of Edinburgh had been a guide for Harry.Unearthed reports reveal that Philip may have played a role in setting Harry on the right path.The prince was known for his rebellious side and was a regular fixture on the party scene.In 2008, Harry reportedly had a series of frank discussions with his grandfather before leaving for Africa, where he worked on charity projects with fellow soldiers from the Household Cavalry. A royal source close to the Duke told the Daily Mail at the time: "Harry will probably go out to let off some steam now he’s back home but he has said his Boujis nights are numbered."He and his grandfather are very close and Harry is determined that Prince Philip knows how seriously he takes his role."Harry has said he is busy planning the next step of his military career and wants to continue doing charity work in Africa."Philip sees a lot of himself in Harry.

He has returned to the UK twice — the first time being for Philip’s funeral in April last year.In 2008, the source close to Harry told the Daily Mail: "I’m told Prince Philip has asked Harry to record a testimonial to be played at his funeral."Harry sees it as a great honour."Due to coronavirus restrictions, only 30 guests were permitted at Philip’s funeral in April 2021. Harry, who flew from California to attend the ceremonial royal funeral, described Philip as “master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end” in a statement ahead of the service. He said in his statement: “He [Philip] will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the monarch, a decorated serviceman, a prince and a duke.“But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end.”Although a reason for Harry’s absence from today’s memorial service was not given, it comes as the Duke is in a legal dispute over the provision of security while he is in the UK.His spokesperson said earlier this month that he hopes to visit the Queen soon.
