If you're struggling with the latest daily puzzle and need a nudge in the right direction, Express Online has put together three clues to help you solve it. We won't be giving away the answer, but continue to the bottom of the page if you want help solving Wordle 259. Good luck! If you're new to Wordle and are not exactly sure how to play it, here's how the popular puzzle game works. Players are given six chances to guess a different five-letter word each day. You'll need to use the process of elimination to get the correct answer. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. Read on for the Wordle 259 hints...
