Phil Collins, who is touring with fellow bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks, remained seated throughout the gig. It comes after the Against All Odds hitmaker has been plagued with a number of health issues in recent years. The 71-year-old injured his vertebrae in his upper back in 2009 - an injury that was sustained during a show. He then had surgery to correct the injury, which went wrong. This left him with crippling nerve damage in his hands which has left him unable to play the instruments he is famous for. Despite Phil's health setbacks, he has continued to perform for his legion of loyal fans. The Genesis trio is back on the road for the European leg of shows, The Last Domino Tour. The band opened their set with the song Behind The Lines and then Duke's End, both from their hit 1980 album, Duke. The setlist was full of Genesis staples including, the Mama, Follow You Follow Me, Invisible Touch, Throwing It All Away and I Can't Dance, among others. Phil was able to hold a microphone and a tambourine during parts of the two-hour show. Fans have since taken to social media and addressed the singer's appearance, with Twitter user, Clayton Lee, saying: "Phil looks frail at 71." Sweeney tweeted: "Omg! He is so unrecognizable. I love me some Phil Collins (Genesis). May God bless him and his health." The musician lost the feeling in his fingers following surgery and could only play drums for the band, as he did previously if the sticks were taped to his hands. He also suffers from a condition called foot drop after a back operation, leaving him needing a stick to help him walk.
