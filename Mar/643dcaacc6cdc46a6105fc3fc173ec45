Ivan Lendl is back on the scene with Andy Murray and the legendary tennis coach is not putting any limits on what the former British No 1 could achieve. It was announced earlier this month that Murray had re-hired Lendl as his coach for a third time. The news caused quite a stir as it's been four-and-a-half years since their last split. Lendl went on to coach Alexander Zverev from 2018 before a far from harmonious split a year later with the German tennis ace hitting out at the 62-year-old. The former world No 1 has stayed away from coaching ever since, but the opportunity to work with Murray again proved too enticing to ignore. He hints that not many players would have been able to convince him to come back on the tour. “Depends who that would be,” Lendl said. “But we have quite a long history with good results and a lot of good times. He really needs help and I’m happy to do that.” JUST IN: Kyrgios reacts to 'crazy' Miami Open point won with racket upside down  Lendl points to Rafael Nadal's incredible win at the Australian Open this year as the perfect example for what the 'Big Four' can achieve. “All these guys have incredible determination,” Lendl said. “They are just like bulldogs and they want to do things because it hasn't been done before. “If they set their mind to it, and they all do, then they can achieve amazing things. If I read it correctly, Rafa said [in November] he wasn't even sure he's going to be able to play again. He goes and wins the Australian Open, so, yes, these guys can do it.” DON'T MISS  The primary plan is for Murray to embark on a four-week training block under Lendl's watch at the United States Tennis Association’s national campus. And Lendl admits that Murray's best chance of making a run in a tournament will come when the grass-court season begins in the summer. "I would say grass is probably Andy's best surface," he added. "A lot of the players, it's their worst surface. That would obviously increase his chances."
