In the current context of a cost of living crisis, many have put their savings plans on hold but it is more important than ever to ensure one has enough saved should the worst case scenario become reality. Research commissioned by Money.co.uk shared just how much Britons should have set aside in different regions of the UK and how much they are falling short.   The average cost of six months’ rent, monthly expenditure, childcare and council tax were all taken into account in the research. This level of emergency fund would provide Britons enough leeway to get back on their feet should they suffer a devastating financial blow such as losing their job. However, real average savings statistics showed Britons are nowhere near their emergency fund goals. The biggest disparity being in the South East where emergency savings are over £19,000 short. The below figures show what it takes to have a healthy emergency fund able to support the average person including childcare costs in different regions.

Salman Haqqi, expert at Money.co.uk, commented:  “Britain is currently in the middle of a cost of living crisis, meaning that having a little extra tucked away in the bank is more crucial than ever to help a growing number of Brits get through to the end of the month. “Consequently, a growing savings account is hard to come by, and most people will struggle to have huge numbers sitting around in bank accounts with low interest rates. Nevertheless, having a safety net in the case of emergencies such as job loss could save your life in the future.”
