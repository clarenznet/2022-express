55-year-old Catwoman actress Halle Berry looked every inch the Hollywood star as she showed off her moves. Meanwhile, the heart-shaped sunglasses she accessorised her outfit with showed off her playful and youthful side even further. Joining her for her impromptu public exercise session was her shirtless personal trainer, who seemed in an equally buoyant mood as he high-fived the star after she caught up with him on their trail. Branding the display "Fitness Friday", she took to her Instagram page to treat fans to the resulting pictures, tagging her health and wellness brand Respin in the process. "Let’s get fit on this #FitnessFriday with @respin!" she announced before quipping: "Who’s joining us?" She added: "You already know what day it is! #FitnessFriday …. and @peterleethomas and I are BACK with another Fitness Friday classic. "Head over to @respin to check out this week’s workout and let us know how many reps you get in today!! "Always work to be the best version of yourself while landing on two feet..or four wheels #respinyourfit." Halle certainly seemed to be channeling the best version of herself when she zipped down the street for a sassy start to the weekend.
