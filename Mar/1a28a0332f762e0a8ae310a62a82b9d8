The crooks forgot rivalries to work together to supply more than Â£1million of heroin and crack cocaine over 11 months. A police source said: "The gangs were very polite to each other, which you don't normally get. It was quite worrying to see how quickly county lines can become established." Users had their homes taken over as bases for selling drugs to pay off their debts. But the rot was stopped by the largest anticounty lines operation in Cheshire Police's history. Almost 400 officers were involved in raids with doors booted in across Birmingham, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Warrington last August. The 42 criminals now await sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court in the coming weeks.
