Wednesday’s Lotto draw boasts a double rollover jackpot of £5.3 million - enough money to permanently alter your life for the better. So what are you waiting for? Tonight’s jackpot is a double rollover, meaning no ticket holder guessed correctly for Saturday night’s draw. If no one wins tonight's lottery jackpot, it will roll over again to Saturday night’s draw. The National Lottery's rollover system provides space for a total of four before the "must be won" stage. Lotto is the most popular National Lottery draw in the UK, with around 15 to 45 million tickets sold twice a week. Lotto tickets only cost £2 and are widely available - even from the comfort of your own home. You can buy your tickets in-store at newsagents, supermarkets and petrol stations, or you can play online and via the National Lottery app. You can only buy tickets between 6am and 11pm, and will need to purchase your ticket before 7.30pm on draw days. Playing is just as easy - pick six numbers from one to 59 and a bonus ball, and you’re good to go. Instead, you can try your hand at a Lucky Dip, which will randomly generate the numbers for you. Once bought, all that is left to do is wait for the draw to find out if you’re the next lucky Lotto winner. You must also be aged at least 18 or over to play National Lottery games. Tonight's winning numbers are: 3, 14, 15, 46, 52, 53 and the Bonus Ball is: 50 If you don’t get your hands on the jackpot, you can still win a range of prizes with the Lotto depending on how many numbers you guessed correctly.
