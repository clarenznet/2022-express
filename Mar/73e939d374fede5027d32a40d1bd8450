An investigation said the majority of the Government agency's 6,200 staff were sent home in the first lockdown and 3,400 were put on paid special leave, doing no work at all. Months later, 2,000 remained on special leave and managers told of working days spent in bed watching TV, a newspaper said. In nine out of the past 24 months, 500 staff were officially not working and either put on special leave or were involved in strike action. Meanwhile, millions of drivers faced licence application and renewal delays and a mountain of 60,000 posts a day built up at the DVLA's Swansea base. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has ordered a "thorough investigation" and "expect" quick answers" from DVLA bosses, a spokesman for the Cabinet minister said. The Times probe said workers were unhappy that those who claimed to be too vulnerable to come to work were placed on special leave and "not doing any work, yet they are out and about mingling with others and going on holiday". A training manager who joked about being at home and avoiding work said: "My manager would be messaging me, 'Can you do this?' and I'd be like, 'You're interrupting my series on Netflix'." Some staff were not able to work from home because they were not allowed remote access to systems with licence holders' personal data. Meanwhile, civil servants on the site had to either work a four-day week or on a week-on, week-off rota to prevent them from "burning out". The Department for Transport said: "We take these allegations extremely seriously." The PCS union said there had been more than 2,200 reported Covid cases at the DVLA, the highest number in anyone UK workplace. A backlog of driving application forms and original identification documents have built up, with the number peaking at 1.6 million cases in September. The number has since dropped to 945,000 cases. The latest snapshot, from January 17, showed that there were only 1,966 staff on site.
