The Duke of Cornwall, 73, who founded the Duchy organic range of foods, wore a white coat and hat to inspect Kern Yarg at Truro's Lynher Dairies. Charles saw how the cheese, invented by Alan Gray - Yarg backwards - in the late 1980s, is made. Alan uses a recipe that involves wrapping the finished curds in stinging nettle leaves to create a rind. Charles - whose Duchy label includes cheddar and savoury oatcakes - told staff: "As patron of the Specialist Cheesemakers Association I could not be more proud of you all." Later he visited the Royal British Legion Centenary Woodland at Nansledan in Newquay, where he unveiled a plaque dedicating the spot to the Queen's Green Canopy as part of his mother's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The Duchy of Cornwall had planted 100 trees specifically chosen for Newquay's climate to create a place for reflection on the sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces. It was opened on Armistice Day last year.
