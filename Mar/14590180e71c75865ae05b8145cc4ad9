At the beginning of each month, two bond holders are chosen at random to win £1million each. However many others have a chance to win cash prizes between £25 - £100,000. Even if people don’t win the £1million jackpot, Britons are urged to check to see if they have won any other cash prizes worth thousands. Premium Bonds holders can check to see if they have won a prize in March’s prize draw, by using the nsandi.com prize checker. Alternatively, If Britons have an Amazon Alexa, they can use the Premium Bonds prize checker skill. Once they have enabled the skill, they can check for prizes, find out when the next results are available and if they have any unclaimed prizes.

There are five people in the UK who could be £100,000 richer and nine others sitting on winnings of £50,000. That’s according to latest figures from National Savings and Investments (NS&I). In London and the South East there are 700,000 unclaimed prizes. On his website MoneySavingExpert.com, financial journalist Martin Lewis provides insight into who the likely winners of the jackpot will be. According to Mr Lewis, those who have more than £5,000 worth in bonds are more likely to win as the more bonds someone has the better their chances. He said: “The more bonds you have, the closer you get to the prize fund rate, and this is where the scales start to tip in Premium Bonds' favour.” This is because each bond is purchased at £1 and like any lottery the more one buys the higher one's chances of winning. Some people believe that bonds bought closer to the draw are more likely to win. Some people believe that bonds bought closer to the draw are more likely to win. However, this theory has been dismissed by NS&I. It states that each bond has an equal chance of winning - no matter when, or where, it was bought. The winners are drawn every month with the next one due at the beginning of April.
