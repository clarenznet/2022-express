The former zookeeper’s rivalry with his nemesis Carole Baskin, the CEO of Big Cat Rescue, kept viewers entertained during the first year of the pandemic. The pair’s bitter feud over the welfare of big cats was captured in the popular Netflix show, ‘Tiger King’. Now, a new limited drama series, ‘Joe vs Carole’ dramatically retells the duo’s real-life cat fight. The eight-parter premieres on the Peacock video streaming service today for UK viewers. ‘Vinyl’ actor John Cameron Mitchell plays Joe, while ‘Saturday Night Live’ star Kate McKinnon plays Carole. The cast also includes Kyle MacLachlan from ‘Twin Peaks’ who plays Howard Baskin, Carole’s husband, as well as Nat Wolff from ‘The Stand’ who plays Joe’s former partner Travis Maldonado. Before Joe — real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage — received global attention with ‘Tiger King’ he was interviewed by documentary maker Louis Theroux in 2011 for the BBC’s film, ‘America’s Most Dangerous Pets’. Following the brilliant reception to ‘Tiger King’, Louis made a new film, ‘Shooting Joe Exotic’, released in 2021. Discussing his latest work in April last year, the filmmaker revealed how Joe had shouted “F*** you” at him during a heated exchange ten years earlier.

F*** Tippi Hedren. F*** PETA. Yes, my animals are happy. Yes, I’m going to go on breeding.’ “He had a tantrum. Any time someone rips their mic off and tells you to f*** yourself… I won’t say it’s never happened before, but it’s not something you typically forget.” Joe’s outburst came as Louis confronted him with tough questions over his big cat wildlife park, GW Zoo, in Oklahoma. The animal park, which bred tigers in captivity, was the subject of intense concerns from animal rights activists, including Carole. Louis, who visited the site three times in 2011, said that he felt he had to hold Joe to account during their final day of filming. The journalist said Joe took issue with his line of questioning and thought he had an animal rights agenda. Louis said he replied to the zookeeper by saying: “I said, ‘Joe, I’m just asking these questions. I don’t mean to upset you. Can we just keep talking?’ “He came back on camera, and we finished the conversation, and I said, ‘Are we buds again?’ “And he goes on, ‘I guess.’ And I said, ‘Can I have a hug?’, and went over and I hugged him.” DON'T MISS: Emmerdale cancelled: ITV soap taken off air in TV schedule shake-up [LATEST]Christopher Plummer lifted lid on surprise Sound of Music secret: 'Awfully hard to match' [INSIGHT]Louis Theroux admission on BBC producer wife: 'I don't trouble her' [ANALYSIS] Louis added: “What struck me was the fact that I seemed to need some emotional reassurance that he was OK. “I felt protective of him, and I didn’t like the fact that I’d upset him. It’s odd.” Joe was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 22 years in prison for violence against tigers and people. A jury convicted him on 17 wildlife charges and two counts of murder-for-hire after he tried to hire two different hitmen to kill Carole. In January of this year, the ‘Tiger King’ star had his sentence reduced to 21 years after he pleaded with a judge for leniency due to his battle with cancer. Joe told a federal judge: “Please don’t make me die in prison waiting for a chance to be free.” ‘Joe vs Carole’ is available on Peacock for viewers with a NOW Entertainment Membership from March 4.
