The Reds go into the game off the back of seven successive victories in the Premier League - a run that's seen them close the gap on leaders City and, technically, have the title race in their hands. Albion, meanwhile, have seen their form dip over the last few weeks. Four defeats on the spin have seen the Seagulls drop into the bottom half of the table. Graham Potter can, however, take encouragement from the side's recent form against Liverpool. Having lost each of their first six Premier League matches against the Merseysiders, Brighton are now unbeaten in their last three against Klopp's men. Liverpool's trip to the south coast will be broadcast live on BT Sport 1 in the UK and Ireland. Coverage of the game starts from 11.30am with kick-off at 12.30pm.
