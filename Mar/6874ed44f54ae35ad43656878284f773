The company has taken Russian vodka brand "Standard" off the shelves, after “concerns raised from consumers”. a spokesperson told Express.co.uk this is the only product that Co-op Food sells that is produced in Russia. The spokesperson added: “Our move is a response to the situation in Ukraine and follows concerns raised from our customers. “It is a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also with Russian people who are against the invasion.” The Co-op spokesperson said that the reasoning behind that is that the product is also overtly marketed as being Russian. A few hours later, it was reported that major UK supermarkets chain Morissons have also decided to stop selling the same product. Upmarket retailer M&S does not sell any vodka that is produced in Russia. A spokesperson from M&S Food told Express.co.uk: "Our vodkas are only manufactured in England, Iceland, and Sweden" Express.co.uk has also reached out to Sainsbury's on whether they plan to follow the boycott. This move of condemnation against Russia follows similar bans from other countries. Finland was the first country to throw Russian alcohol out of the market. On Monday, through its government-controlled alcohol retailing monopoly, Alko, the country removed about 50 products of Russian origin from its market. Retailers in Sweden, Norway, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania also joined the boycott the days that followed. On Wednesday, 141 countries, member states of the United Nations, voted to condemn Russia’s actions.
