The valley of bulbs is among a target one million planted year by year as the dying wish of millionaire Keith Owen - who planned to retire in Sidmouth, Devon. The banker and former RAF airman was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2007 and left life savings of Â£2.3million to a local conservation society. He contacted the Sid Vale Association (SVA) and said he wanted his gift to "support local projects, which made use of voluntary labour, and in particular to sustain the ambience and way of life recognised in Sidmouth". He particularly wanted a million flowers planted. Some of the 153,000 latest spring bulbs are now in flower at Peak Hill and other sites. Ed Harrison of Sidmouth Civic Society said: "Every year it brings back happy memories of this man who did this amazing thing for the town."
