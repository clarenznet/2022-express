If you've recently purchased a PlayStation 4/PS5, or perhaps you've simply run out of games to play after Christmas, then now is the time to visit the PlayStation Store. Sony is holding a brand new sale for March 2022, discounting dozens of games as part of its Mega March promotion. This includes discounts on high profile releases such as FIFA 22, Battlefield 2042, It Takes Two, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Deathloop. "The aptly named Mega March promotion brings mega savings to PlayStation Store from Wednesday, March 16," Sony explains. "For a limited time enjoy discounts across a variety of games and add-ons. "That includes the likes of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Deluxe PS4 & PS5, FIFA 22 on PS4 and Back 4 Blood: Deluxe Edition PS4 & PS5." The Mega March promotion runs until March 30, giving fans a couple of weeks to take advantage of the deals. In terms of highlights, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal than the one currently available for FIFA 22. The annual sports release is down to just £15.59 for the standard edition, which represents a saving of more than 70%. Elsewhere, Battlefield 2042 is reduced to £29.99, which is the same price as the excellent Deathloop.
