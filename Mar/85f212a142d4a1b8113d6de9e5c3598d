Simone Ashley, 26, who plays Kate Sharma in the Netflix show, attended the Bridgerton premiere at London's Tate Modern on Tuesday. The actress ensured all eyes were on her as she put on a very risqué display after she was joined by her fellow castmates Jonathan Bailey and Charithra Chandran. Jonathan was seen putting on a playful display with his on-screen romantic interests Simone and Charithra (played Edwina Sharma) at the premiere. The actor, 33, looked dapper in a grey suit with a white shirt and a black tie, as he joined his glamorous female co-stars at the hotly-anticipated screening. Jonathan previously teased that the love triangle arc in the series would be "intense" as he attracts the interest of the two-on-screen sisters. Taking to the red carpet, the trio could be seen in high spirits as they posed for pictures. But Simone almost risked an awkward wardrobe malfunction in her racy attire. The actress posed for photos as she headed to the show premiere. Simone opted for a frock that drew attention to her hot pants while sporting a see-through skirt. She wore a sheer black skirt with sequinned floral embroidery and opted for black satin high-band hot pants underneath. Her skirt featured a ruffled olive green velvet hem and she wore a pair of black net stockings. The Bridgerton star gave a glimpse of her midriff in a white cropped top with ruffled detail. She accessorised her daring look with a pair of long sleeve gloves in the same pattern as her skirt. Simone showcased her glamourous looks with a bold pink eyeshadow, burgundy blush to accentuate her cheekbones with a matching lip. She wore some dazzling diamond earrings for her outing. The on-screen star posed for pictures alongside her castmates as her dark tresses cascaded down past her shoulders.
