Katy had been in the middle of a surprise performance of her hit song when the incident happened. The singer was accompanied by her fellow judges for the rendition, as the show's contestants looked on. However, when she crouched down during her song, an audible rip could be heard. This led the audience to gasp in surprise in a moment from the new episode of the show. Luke Bryan could be heard saying: “They busted.” Lionel then quipped: “The concert is officially over.” While Katy asked: "Can I get some tape - some gaffer tape?" In the clip obtained by PEOPLE, a show logo could be seen covering up the incident while her co-stars taped up her trousers.
