Olympic boxing star Caroline Dubois has joined Express Sport's Women in Sport series and will be the second guest on the show. The show casts a focus on the crucial role women play in sport far and wide alongside the #SheCan movement. BT Sport presenter Jules Breach was last week's guest, with the 34-year-old keen to point out that opportunities have increased for women within sport. However, there is still work to be done - thus highlighting the need for the campaign to continue. Dubois, 21, is the next guest on the series, with the Enfield-born boxer set to talk about her experiences until now. The super bantamweight comes from a boxing-mad family. Her brother Daniel, 24, is a professional boxer who held the WBA heavyweight title from June to August 2021. Other brothers Prince and Solomon are also involved in the sport. And Caroline started in the same gym as Daniel - Repton Boxing Club - even though girls were banned from there. Caroline had to pretend to be a boy named Colin just to be able to train there. Regardless, Caroline soldiered on to show everyone what she can do. And she has made incredible progress since those days. Dubois almost won an Olympic gold medal on her visit to Tokyo last summer, losing on a split decision in the lightweight quarter-finals to Sudaporn Seesondee of Thailand. That has not deterred Dubois, however, and she is working hard to potentially go one better in Paris in 2024. And last month, Dubois won her first ever professional fight with a points decision victory over Lithuanian star Vaida Masiokaite. Easing to victory, Dubois - trained by Shane McGuigan - indicated she has a huge future ahead to follow up on her 37-3 amateur record.
