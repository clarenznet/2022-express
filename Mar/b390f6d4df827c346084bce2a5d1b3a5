Victoria Pendleton, 41, took part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2012, just a mere five days after she had competed in the London Olympics. The sports star was partnered with Brendan Cole and has recalled how "clumsy" the pair were together, causing struggles behind-the-scenes. The couple made it to week eight of the show, before being eliminated for their rendition of the Salsa. Speaking to Express.co.uk about the experience, she said: "Honestly, the pair of us were just really clumsy. "It was really funny, just always tripping over or slipping over. "During the Quickstep I had to run up a couple of stairs and I fell down at the last minute on some cases that were part of the stage set.

"We just smiled and tried to ignore it. We were both just having trouble with stairs that day. "I had a big bruise on my shin from tripping over my own skirt, but it was funny that Brendan then did it. "I kept telling them to make my dresses smaller as I was only small and short and I can’t walk in them."

She won nine world titles, including a record six in the individual sprint, dominating the event between 2005 and 2012.
