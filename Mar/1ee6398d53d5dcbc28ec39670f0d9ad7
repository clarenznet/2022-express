It is compounded by price rises in essentials such as food and fuel, as wages, pensions and benefits fail to keep pace with inflation. And a House of Commons briefing says the invasion of Ukraine will keep prices high, with inflation hitting 8.1 per cent by autumn. Dennis Reed, of senior citizens group Silver Voices, said: "These are really astronomical price rises coming down the line. Before the current crisis there were two million older people on the brink of poverty. This is going to increase that way up, to five or six million." Citizens Advice says food bank referrals are up 26 per cent on last year, 33 per cent more people are seeking fuel debt help and 46 per cent more need help to buy clothes and other essentials. Its CEO, Dame Clare Moriarty, said: "Rising costs are simply swallowing what's left of people's budgets. "One of our advisers spoke to a parent last week having to choose between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime or putting on the heating for an hour while they got ready for school. These stark choices are only going to get worse fromApril, when energy bills rise again." Dame Clare urged ministers to raise benefits in line with inflation and bring in a support package when bills soar further in the autumn.  Senior economist Rebecca McDonald, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: "We are worried about people who are already in arrears or families who will have to borrow or fall into debt." Garry Lemon, of The Trussell Trust, which supports food banks, said: "We continue to see more and more facing impossible decisions like whether to put food on the table or heat homes. "For many of us who aren't able to work or work longer hours, there is little protection ahead."
