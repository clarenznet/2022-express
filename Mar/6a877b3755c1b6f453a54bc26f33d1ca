Strictly Come Dancing winner, Stacey Dooley, didn't hesitate to poke fun at her professional dancer boyfriend Kevin Clifton after he shared a daring snap earlier today, wearing just a pair of "budgie smugglers". The flame-haired star, 35, was one of the first of Kevin's followers to comment on the revealing picture which saw her cheekily draw a comparison between her beau and Olympic diving champion, Tom Daley. In view of his 361,000 followers, the dancer revealed that he's taking part in a new ITV show called The Games. Standing in a changing room, Kevin only wore a pair of swimming trunks as he showcased his incredibly toned body. Looking unimpressed at the situation, he prepared to head out to the pool area. The West End star captioned the snap: "@thegamestv Let’s go! Coming soon to @itv," followed by a flexed arm emoji.
