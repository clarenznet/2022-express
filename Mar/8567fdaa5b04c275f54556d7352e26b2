The warnings from Remainers were stark - a vote to leave the bloc would trigger an immediate recession, a painful fall in house prices, and a steep drop in exports. So far, little has changed since our historic exit from the Brussels bloc but with the UK in the tight grip of a cost of living crisis, with energy bills now higher than ever before, soaring inflation and tax rises coming next month, some are questioning in the face of crisis just how well the UK is doing outside of the EU. But is Brexit to blame? One look on Twitter shows some remainers remarking that their Brexit warnings were 'coming true'. One person wrote: "You told us it was all project fear. And it's all coming true. And worse." However, multiple international crises have taken place since Britain left the EU, including the coronavirus pandemic, global supply chain issues and the outbreak of war in Ukraine, making difficult to wade through the mire and see what is actually causing the problems ordinary Brits face. Do you think Brexit is the cause? If not, where does the blame lie for the UK’s problems? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
