Touring to support the recent 40th anniversary reissue of her 1981 debut album, Hopelessly In Love, Carroll thrilled the audience at London’s Boisdale with a set packed with tender classics including 1980’s I’m So Sorry, Just A Little Bit, and of course, Hopelessly In Love itself. England-born Carroll, 61, was the leading light on the UK lovers' rock scene, and has lost none of her power to impress as she fuses her soulful vocals with melancholic melodies. She quickly bought the crowd to their feet, singing along to her every note. It's not just a skank down memory lane, it's an emotional release with lyrics that apply to anyone who had ever fallen in love, and experienced the emotional charge that comes with it. Often dubbed "the album that triggered the baby boom"’, Hopelessly In Love has sold more than one million copies worldwide and was recently voted The Greatest Lovers Rock Album of All Time by readers of Mojo. Award-winning singer, songwriter and composer Carroll has provided vocals for superstars such as Michael Jackson, Sade, Stevie Wonder, Annie Lennox and the Pet Shop Boys to name a few. Her remastered album is represented in its original sleeve and includes five bonus tracks. Performing Alongside Carroll was the legendary Silly Games singer Janet Kay. The song went to Number Two in 1979 making Janet the first person to perform a lovers' rock tune on Top Of The Pops. A thoroughly engaging and entertaining performance.  Carroll Thompson and Janet Kay return to London Boisdale on April 30. For tickets and more tour dates see: seetickets.com.
