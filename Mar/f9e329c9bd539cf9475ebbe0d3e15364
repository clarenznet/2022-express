In a speech during the Scottish Conservative party conference, Mr Jack claimed the Nationalist administration’s politics demand “constant friction" with the UK Government. The Scottish Secretary stressed the people of Scotland rightly “expect their two governments to work together” because they “understand it is the best way to unlock the potential of devolution”.He admitted: “Now, it is not always easy to work with this SNP-Green Scottish Government.“Of course it can be difficult trying to deliver the benefits of devolution alongside a Nationalist administration in Edinburgh that does not believe in devolution.“An administration whose politics demand constant friction with the UK Government and a freshly brewed grievance every morning.“They may not be able to manufacture a ferry, ladies and gentlemen, but they sure know how to manufacture a grievance.” Ahead of May’s local elections, Mr Jack insisted it was “worth reflecting on the difference between our [UK Government] approach and that of the Scottish Government.” He added: “The real devolution I’m talking about stands in stark contrast to the centralising instincts of the SNP-Green government.“Hoarding decision-making and resources in Edinburgh.” Mr Jack pointed to the Scottish Government’s lack of engagement with Sir Peter Hendy’s Union Connectivity Review for a strategic transport network covering the whole UK.For Scotland, the review recommended upgrades of the A75, the A77, and the A1.But the Dumfries and Galloway MP made clear that working with the nationalist administration resulted in some success with bringing two new Freeports after some wrangling.The two new Freeports in Scotland are backed by up to £52m of UK Government investment along with a full range of tax breaks and benefits.However, he slated the SNP’s Green government partners opposition to the scheme, and added: “Something you would have thought all parties in Scotland would welcome.
