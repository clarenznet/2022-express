But Refugee minister Lord Harrington said the first families could be here so soon, they may have to stay in unvetted accommodation. The number of people registering interest in opening up their houses and flats on the Homes For Ukraine website last night reached 138,000. A further 20,000 have applied to bring in relatives under the separate Ukraine Family Scheme - and officials said 5,500 visas had already been granted to them. Speaking about the Ukrainians' imminent arrival, Lord Harrington said: "I'm talking next week - I'm expecting thousands of people." He warned it "may not be possible" to check homes on offer. But he added: "It's our duty to make sure they've got a roof over their head and they're fed properly. For the moment we just have to get these people in."
