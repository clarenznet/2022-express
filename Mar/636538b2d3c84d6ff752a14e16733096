Shingles is a reaction to the same virus as chickenpox. There are several signs which may indicate the condition and when they do strike early treatment allows the pain and rash to slightly subside. What are two key elements when it comes to at-home treatments to reduce shingles symptoms? Shingles is a skin condition and as with other skin conditions there are several dos and don’ts.

The reason for this is because it can slow down the healing process, thus increasing the amount of time one spends in displeasure. Other important tips to remember when it comes to shingles and treatment includes: When it comes to pain, the NHS says it may be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. “You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender,” it adds. The national health body adds: “Shingles usually affects a specific area on one side of the body and doesn't cross over the midline of the body (an imaginary line running from between your eyes down past the belly button). “Any part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, but the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas.” If your immune system is healthy, your chances of having shingles again in the first several years is lower than it is for people who have never had shingles. Your chances of a second bout go up over time, but one study suggests within seven years the odds of getting shingles again are about five percent. Your skin can be painful for weeks after the rash has gone, but it usually gets better over time. If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder. Early symptoms of shingles include:
