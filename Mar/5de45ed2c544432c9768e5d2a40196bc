This was the latest disruption to the airline which has faced a number of IT meltdowns in recent months.  Passenger Will Karkar tweeted: "Been stuck at Heathrow for 2.5 hours unable to check in with BA due to them experiencing a 'global IT system failure'." BA said: "This has now been resolved." Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: "Airlines should be offering a refund or to reroute passengers."
