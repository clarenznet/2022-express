Some huge stars have played the Dark Knight in live-action over the years. And now as Robert Pattinson debuts in The Batman, Michael Keaton will soon be reprising Bruce Wayne in Batgirl and The Flash. If that wasn’t enough, Ben Affleck is returning for the later multiverse epic with him. But of the live-action Batman movie stars, who is the best? From Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney to Christian Bale, Ben Affleck and Robert Pattinson? Well now Slingo have polled over 2000 UK adults to discover Britain’s favourite take on the Caped Crusader of all. To determine the best, voters were asked to select their top 3 favourites. It turns out the UK’s favourite Batman is none other than Bale, who starred in Christopher Nolan’s much loved and critically acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy. The British actor won 26 per cent of the vote, with Keaton just behind in second. However, the big surprise was seeing Pattinson bottom on 9 per cent. Although, it’s worth pointing out the survey took place between March 2-4, with The Batman only hitting cinemas on that last day so many participants won’t have had a chance to judge his much-praised performance properly. Here are the full results for the country’s favourite take on Batman.
