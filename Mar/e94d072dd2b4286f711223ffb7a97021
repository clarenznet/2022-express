A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex on Friday confirmed that Harry will not return to the UK from the US to join the Royal Family at the event for the Duke of Edinburgh at Westminster Abbey on March 29. He hopes to visit his grandmother soon, the spokesperson added. Senior aides told The Sun that the monarch got just 15 minutes’ notice of Harry’s statement. It comes as the Duke, who is living in California with Meghan Markle, is embroiled in a legal row with the Home Office over a decision not to allow him to pay for police protection for his family while in Britain. Harry's spokesperson declined to comment on the reason for his decision to miss the memorial service. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY.
