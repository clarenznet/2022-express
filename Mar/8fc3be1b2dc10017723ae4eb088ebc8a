The French President gathered EU leaders at Versailles on Thursday for a two-day summit to address Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began last month. Mr Macron was among those to reject Ukraine’s attempt to join the EU after the 27-nation bloc said it will study its accession bid. He told reporters: “With a country at war? I don’t think so … Must we close the door and say ‘never’? That would be unjust.” Professor Michael Bruter, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, who is director of the Electoral Psychology Observatory, discussed how Mr Macron’s image may have been boosted by his response to Putin’s war. He said: “I think that he is benefitting from the current situation because he is seen as somebody who is great at dealing with a crisis. “I think that is the bottom line. “He is seen as the sort of guy you want on your team when you are facing really difficult situations.” The political expert stressed that, although he thought Mr Macron was benefitting from his stance on the overall crisis, his talks with Putin were not as much of a factor. “One way or another, the French voice is clearly more audible under Macron than it would have been under either Hollande or Sarkozy before. “Certainly, more than it would be under Le Pen or Mélenchon or Zemmour.” Professor Bruter said Mr Macron’s leadership style on the international stage contrasted to that of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The expert claimed that Mr Macron appeared more “serious” than his UK counterpart. He said: “I think that Boris Johnson’s communication plan is to come across as a nice, laid-back, original, slightly weird leader, somebody people feel like relating to. “Macron is in a very different emotional register. “He tries to come across as the competent, serious, intelligent, knowledgeable leader. “It is a very different approach in many ways.”
