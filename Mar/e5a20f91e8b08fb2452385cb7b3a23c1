Jenny Powell, 53, stunned fans as she put on an eye-popping display in a sparkly red jumpsuit last night. The Wheel of Fortune star was in charge of hosting the Northern Digital Awards at Leeds Dock. Jenny’s show-stopping flare jumpsuit featured a geometrical pattern and red sequins all over. She finished off the look with a smokey eye and light pink lip. Jenny opted to have her wavy hair down and straightened her voluminous fringe. The presenter shared some pictures and videos of the event on her Instagram, where she gathered a whopping 104,000 followers. One of the videos, re-posted from Don’t Panic Event’s account, featured the caption: “Here comes Powell,” as she walked toward the camera.
