Latest data from Experian Catalist showing prices at 165.89p per litre for petrol and 177.34p per litre for diesel. This is up from just 148.0p and 151.6p a month ago, respectively. The RAC reports that the cost to fill an average tank of petrol is around £88, while diesel is over £92. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that drivers “badly need a break from these relentless daily rises”. Mr Williams hopes retailers will “soon start to pass on recent reductions in the price of wholesale fuel”. He said drivers will be looking for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to provide support by cutting fuel duty or VAT to “end their misery” in his spring statement next week. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would have "further conversations" with Mr Sunak – but that the decision would be down to the Chancellor. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said her constituents needed urgent help "as they struggle to make decisions over which basic essentials to cut" during the cost-of-living crisis.

This could include changing driving habits, sharing cars and working from home - and even a shift to more efficient vehicles. So how have YOU been affected?
