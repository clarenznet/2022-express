That's what the team constructing Britain's latest nuclear power plant did, as these amazing images show. More formally known as SGC-250, Big Carl is the world's largest super crane. The 656 ft-tall giant made light work of hauling the third of three massive 347-ton steel rings into place at Hinkley Point in Somerset, yesterday. Capable of lifting a whopping 3,000 tons at a time, Big Carl is helping build the atomic plant's first reactor building. But getting the crane here from its home in Belgium was no mean feat. A fleet of 250 trucks was needed to haul the beast to Britain. Named after Carl Sarens, boss of the firm that built it, the machine is taller than London's Gherkin, the London Eye and Big Ben. It's already added 56ft to the green energy project in a single day, changing the site's skyline. Construction of Hinkley Point C has gained fresh impetus thanks to the energy price crisis as Britain attempts to cut its reliance on imported fossil fuels. Once finished, the nuclear power plant's two reactors will provide 3,260MW of low carbon electricity for around 6 million homes.
