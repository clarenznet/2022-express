However, campaigners have said the decision will do little to limit fuel bills which have been rising rapidly in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last month. Pictures show the massive rigs in the harbour, along with 30 wind turbine frameworks for the nearby Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm. Work on the proposed development off the west coast of Shetland was halted in December after Shell decided to withdraw from the project, concluding the economic case for investment was "not strong enough".However, oil has since risen to more than £76 a barrel, with fears over the future of Russian oil sending prices soaring.Sources told the BBC that although the company's official position remains the same, it has acknowledged the "economic, political and regulatory environment had changed enormously" in the three months since Shell announced it was pulling out of the project.Environmental campaigners have long opposed the proposed field, claiming it would pose a risk to marine wildlife.In November, after months of pressure from opposition parties and campaigners, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the project should not go ahead.Industry body Oil and Gas UK previously said blocking long-planned energy projects like Cambo would risk leaving the UK at the mercy of global energy shortages. However, Greenpeace warned the proposed development would not tackle high bills or improve energy security and urged the Government to throw its weight behind renewables, insulation and heat pumps to wean the UK off oil and gas.Shell's decision to pull out was announced just weeks after the UK hosted the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, during which countries pledged to try to limit global warming to 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of an overheating planet.The International Energy Agency has said that no new oil and gas exploration projects should go ahead if the world is to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2050.Philip Evans, oil and gas transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK, warned the Cambo project would produce heavy crude oil, for which the UK has very little refining capacity, and it would "do nothing to tackle high bills or shore up energy security".He said: "Shell wasn't interested in pursuing this project when it was a bad look for them, but now they stand to gain billions in the midst of wartime price hikes, they're interested again. "Meanwhile our bills soar, and offshore workers are trapped in a volatile industry. The UK and North Sea communities deserve better.”He added: "With the spring statement and a new energy strategy coming up, the Government must throw its weight behind British renewables, a proper home insulation scheme and heat pump rollout, or our energy policy will be disrupted by the whims of fossil fuel giants for decades."Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Danny Gross added: "Developing the Cambo oil field would do nothing to reduce soaring fuel bills. As 80 percent of the oil extracted in the UK is exported, it wouldn't meaningfully improve our energy security either."The energy crisis highlights the need to reduce our reliance on increasingly expensive gas and oil that are also wrecking our climate.”The yellow frames, which will be anchored to the sea bed, have been delivered from China, providing a base for wind turbines at Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm, 20 miles off the coast of Angus in the outer Firth of Forth.Shell has been approached for comment.
