Liverpool ace Harvey Elliott has been tipped to go on and become a superstar at Anfield. Thiago Alcantara has also been warned that his standing in the squad hierarchy could plummet as the youngster’s stature grows. Liverpool star Elliott has been tipped to freeze Thiago out of the squad by former Premier League star Alan Hutton, who believes that the 18-year-old will become a starter under Jurgen Klopp soon. While Elliott had started out his fledgling career on the wings, he has been utilised in midfield by Jurgen Klopp and it has gone well so far. The teenager has played just 17 times for the Reds but has already helped them win the UEFA Super Cup, Club World Cup, Premier League and Carabao Cup. And the German coach trusted him enough to bring him on against Chelsea on Sunday in the League Cup final where they won on penalties. That was at the expense of Thiago, who had been injured in the warm-up, meaning Naby Keita was promoted from the bench. But Hutton believes it will be Elliott who will claim the spot ahead of the Spaniard in midfield very soon. It is not yet known how long the former Bayern Munich star will be out while the former right-back said: “I think Elliott’s a superstar. “I watched him in that central midfield role at the start of the season against Burnley – and he was outstanding. “He’s definitely got the ability. He can pick a pass and he plays with no fear whatsoever – and that’s really refreshing. “He’s come back quickly from a really nasty injury, which is brilliant – but he’ll be looking to build on that. "This injury to Thiago could give him that chance. “I’ve got no doubts that he’ll go on to be a superstar for Liverpool.” Elliott has only just returned from his own serious injury after five months out following a fractured ankle. But the youngster has made a quick recovery and has looked outstanding at times with fans looking forward to his future at Anfield.
