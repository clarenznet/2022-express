The change to the online store's Own Range food potentially saves thousands of tons from being binned. A spokesman said it would let customers decide when an item was past its best. A report by charity Wrap said UK stores could save 14 million baskets of food going to waste by removing best-before dates and plastic packaging on uncut fruit and veg. It followed an 18-month study of the five most wasted items - apples, bananas, broccoli, cucumber and potatoes. Experts estimated a combined yearly saving of 100,000 tons of household food waste, more than 10,300 tons of plastic and 130,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. "Best before" labels refer to food quality, meaning it is still safe to eat when past its best. "Use by" tags are for safety, indicating food should not be eaten after that date. Morrisons scrapped use by dates on milk while Tesco has axed best before labels on 116 of its products.
