The laser-guided STARStreak and Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) provide commanders with fresh ways to repel Russian air assaults. STARStreak can be carried by a soldier and is the world’s fastest surface-to-air missile, hitting its target at Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound. It is also harder for defensive flares to jam it. The LMM explodes up to 10ft from its target, giving a wider margin of error. Like the anti-tank weapons already provided to the Kyiv regime by Britain, STARStreak lets troops take cover immediately before and after attacking. Col Graham Taylor, Commander of 7th Air Defence Group, said: “How effective that is, depends on the quality of the training and depends on how the Ukrainians will want to work with it. “It is not like a Stinger [another surface-to-air missile]. A Stinger is an infrared, heat-seeking ‘fire and forget’ munition. The HVM [STARStreak High-Velocity Missile] is more complex in its aiming unit. At the same time, it is much more accurate. It is an extremely useful piece of kit.” Sgt Skee Sauligia, 42, of 12th Regiment Royal Artillery, who has trained with both missile systems, said: “They are both efficient. They can both do the job.” Britain is also deploying a “game-changing” piece of defence kit to Ukraine’s northern neighbour Poland – the Sky Sabre missile system. Its radar can detect aircraft, missiles and smart bombs up to 74 miles away while its missiles have an improved range of 15 miles, giving defenders more time to repel air attacks. Sgt Alex Henry, 42, of 16th Regiment RA said: “It is also programmed for future air threats.” Col Taylor added: “This is a defensive deployment and purposefully is protecting Polish airspace.”
