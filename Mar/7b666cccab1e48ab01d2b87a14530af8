The six year entitlement gap in different parts of the UK has sparked outrage, but Britons are urged to claim their dues as soon as they become eligible. In England, residents can claim a free bus pass once they reach the state pension age, but those living in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and parts of the UK including London could claim at age 60.  The current state pension age is 66 but could increase further. This could see England residents waiting six or more years to get the same travel concessions as their counterparts in other areas of the UK. To receive the free bus pass, residents can contact their local council in England that is responsible for administering the benefit. Londoners who are aged over 60 can apply online through the Transport for London website to receive their London Oyster photocard.

Applicants can use the photocard until they are eligible for a Freedom Pass. For applicants in other parts of England, they can go to the Gov.uk website where they will be asked to enter their postcode. The site will then redirect them to their corresponding council website where they can download the application form.

In order to be eligible for either SmartPass, applicants must be permanently resident in Northern Ireland for a minimum of three months. To apply for the SmartPasses, residents can use one of three methods:
