HMS Queen Elizabeth left Portsmouth, Hampshire, at 4pm for training and other exercises after being berthed for three months. The most powerful vessel ever constructed for the Royal Navy, the warship is capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft. She visited more than 40 countries during her 224 days at sea on her maiden deployment leading the UK Carrier Strike Group (CSG). But now the ship, worth £3billion, will prepare for Exercise "Strike Warrior", a Navy project which will take place off the coast of Scotland in May. The UK-led war-fighting exercise, including several other NATO navies, will be the final test for the Carrier Strike Group before it undertakes its maiden deployment. The Carrier Strike Group is designed to modernise and embolden the Royal Navy, reports Hampshire Live. Speaking last month, Commodore Steve Moorhouse, Commander UK Carrier Strike Group, said: "The new UK Carrier Strike Group is the embodiment of British maritime power, and sits at the heart of a modernised and emboldened Royal Navy. "Protected by a ring of advanced destroyers, frigates, helicopters and submarines, and equipped with fifth generation fighters, HMS Queen Elizabeth is able to strike from the sea at a time and place of our choosing; and with our NATO allies at our side, we will be ready to fight and win in the most demanding circumstances. "Carrier Strike offers Britain choice and flexibility on the global stage; it reassures our friends and allies and presents a powerful deterrent to would-be adversaries." It comes after American B-52 long-range bombers were pictured at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire on Sunday. At least two of the B-52H Stratofortress bombers since flew over Romania on Monday, according to Flight Radar tracking website. Much of the recent military activity is linked to the NATO mission to defend allied airspaces against Russia in the face of their invasion of Ukraine.
