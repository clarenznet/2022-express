The veteran fliers say they were left with painful neck and spinal conditions caused by constantly swivelling to look at a CCTV screen showing air crew buzzing to be let in. The veteran fliers say they were left with painful neck and spinal conditions caused by constantly swivelling to look at a CCTV screen showing air crew buzzing to be let in. The three-camera security system was brought in after the 9/11 attacks to stop terrorists invading the plane's cockpit, giving pilots a clear camera view of anyone wishing to gain entry. Lawyers for the 16 say screens displaying those outside the cockpit should have been positioned at the front of the cabin, preventing fliers from having to crane their necks. They are claiming compensation ranging from £10,000 to £100,000 - and lawyers say there could be health and safety issues if a pilot was to suffer an injury mid-flight due to twisting their neck. BA denies liability, claiming it did not breach its duty to keep the pilots safe from injury, as well as contesting the size of their claims. The case is spearheaded by Cpt Jonathan Parry, 57, who joined the airline in 2006 following a stint in the Royal Navy, and spent years flying Boeing 757 and 767 jets up to 2014. In court documents, his barrister Christopher Edwards says Cpt Parry, of Camberley, Surrey, claims to have been strapped so tight into his cockpit chair that it was awkward to switch his whole body round to check the cockpit door security surveillance system monitor. Instead he had to twist his neck up to five times an hour before operating the flight deck door release, which he said amounted to a total of around 5,000 "neck twists per year". Cpt Parry says he suffered a slipped disc and spinal damage and had to undergo surgery in 2015. The case reached Central London County Court last week as lawyers hammered out pre-trial issues involving legal costs and quantifying the 16 claims. No date has yet been fixed for the trial.
