Shane Warne’s family led mourners at a private funeral at St Kilda Football Club ground in Melbourne on Sunday. Around 80 people attended the service including Shane’s children Jackson, Brooke and Summer and his ex-wife Simone Callahan. Jackson was seen holding a cricket ball as he left the procession and Shane’s loved ones wore St Kilda Saints scarfs as a tribute to his favourite football team. Other attendees included Dannii Minogue, former Australia captains Michael Clarke and Allan Border as well as ex-England captain Michael Vaughan. Shane’s hearse completed a lap of honour around the oval as 80s classic (I’ve Had) The Time of My Life played. Other songs at the intimate ceremony included Coldplay’s Yellow and Fix You and The Best by Tina Turner, as reported by MailOnline. A state funeral will be held for the sports star at Melbourne Cricket Ground on March 30. Shane died aged 52 on March 4 while he was on holiday in Thailand. A post mortem exam concluded that the cricket legend died of natural causes, as confirmed by Thai police.
