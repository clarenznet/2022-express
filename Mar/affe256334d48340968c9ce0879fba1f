The This Morning guest hit back at Nicola Thorp who claimed Brexit was to blame for the speed it was taking for Ukrainian refugees to be allowed into the country. The discussion between Nicola and Julia became heated with Phillip Schofield having to step in to diffuse the row. Nicola began: “I just wish it wasn't the case. I wish I wasn't able to say that but it's what I do believe in my heart.” “So, you're saying this is intentional,” Phillip weighed in as Nicola replied: “It is a government built on immigration. “They’re taking their time to find out the best way they can manage both for their voters and refugees.” Hitting back at her claims, Julia raged: “I don't think it's a fair point of view it's a typical Remoaner hobbyhorse…anything to blame.” She continued: “If you’re saying this is a government built on immigration and hating foreigners which is basically what you're saying, Nicola, is you're saying British people are xenophobic and horrible.” “British people are very much in support of bringing in Ukrainian refugees.”   Defending her comments, Nicola replied: “I'm not saying British people are horrible, I'm not saying that someone who voted for Brexit is horrible.   “I'm talking about this government, look at the facts, we've got 300 people who've come through.”         Nicola’s reply seemed to anger Julia even more, as she fumed: “You are! “Nicola, you raised Brexit you knew exactly what you were doing, this is your hobbyhorse, let's talk about.” “No, this is the first time I’ve spoken about Brexit,” Nicola claimed. Julia pointed out: “The British people want to help, they're incredibly generous and charitable.

The government just hasn't got its act together.”   Viewers also took to social media to share their thoughts on the discussion, with many slamming Julia for her comments.   Kiren wrote: “Why #thismorning insist on allowing this waste of air Julia Hartley-Brewer on the show is beyond me.”         Davies raged: “I can't stand Julia. Honestly, the woman really sets my teeth on edge.”   While Simon added: “#thismorning Julia Hartley-Brewer desperate to shut down debate about #Ukraine️ refugees at Calais and to deny it’s got anything to do with her #brexit.” (sic)   “Julia whatever her name is on #ThisMorning is so annoying. Twisting every word to the Tory agenda,” Alicia tweeted.   Sam said: “Julia all heart, as usual, horrid woman #ThisMorning.” (sic)   This Morning airs weekdays at 10am on ITV.
