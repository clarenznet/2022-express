Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, looks stunning as ever in a new selfie with her husband Michael Douglas, 77. The Prodigal Son actress sent fans into a frenzy with the rare snap, which she posted on her Instagram account. The two members of Hollywood royalty, who tied the knot in 2000, can both be seen sitting in the front of a car, beaming into the camera. Harking back to the Hollywood Golden Age, Catherine captioned the post after a line from the  1942 film Casablanca. "Here's looking at you, kid," she wrote. Catherine is wearing a simple black top with frills around the sleeves and minimal makeup, while Michael looks suave in a white shirt with sunglasses and a pricey-looking watch. Immediately, fans of the famous couple flocked to comment on the beautiful photo. Mama_Holm wrote: “You both are beautiful!” Melinda added: “Gorgeous couple”. “You both look amazing,” gushed Michele.
