Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are walking out in a dispute over pensions blasted as a “kick in the teeth” by central London businesses struggling to recover from the pandemic. In a statement TFL said that customers should consider alternative forms of transport and prepare for severe disruption if they do attempt to use the network. They said: “We are urging customers whose journeys rely on the Tube to work from home if they can, consider alternative modes of transport and leave extra time for essential journeys.“While customers should prepare for no service throughout the day on Thursday, if any service is provided it will not continue into the evening and all journeys will need to be completed by 6.30pm.”A TFL spokesman gave additional travel advice to customers that disruption will continue on Friday.He said: “The planned action is also likely to severely impact services on Friday, with no service until at least 8am and a severely disrupted service after this. “Customers are advised to avoid travelling in the early morning on Friday, check before they travel and aim to make journeys from mid-morning.”Andy Lord, TfL’s chief operating officer, admitted that customers would be “frustrated” by the disruption.He said: “I apologise to customers for this and understand they will be frustrated by this strike action ,but urge them not to take it out on those who are trying to help.”In contrast RMT General Secretary Mick Lynch blasted London Mayor Sadiq Khan after he criticised his union claiming that striking wouldn’t help securing a deal with the Government any easier.
