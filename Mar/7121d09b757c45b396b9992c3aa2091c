We’ve teamed up with Dobbies Garden Centres to give you the chance to pick up a free packet of Mr Fothergill’s Giant Single Sunflower seeds from one of 74 Dobbies Garden Centres across the UK to encourage unity by planting this unique flower. The Sunflower has a long, rich history as an important part of Ukrainian culture dating back to the 1800’s, and is a common sight in village gardens all across the country as well as a major export from the seeds and oil. Recently, the Sunflower has become a symbol of resistance and strength – used by both civilians and the army to spread the message of hope. Don't miss Monday's Daily Express to get your free Sunflower seeds voucher and redeem at your nearest Dobbies Garden Centre.
