Buckingham Palace said the event would commemorate Prince Philip's "dedication to family, nation and Commonwealth". Confirmation of the Queen's attendance at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday would probably happen on the day. She had to pull out of the Commonwealth Day service last week amid concerns for her comfort, which are thought to have been linked to mobility issues. The Palace confirmed yesterday that members of the Royal Family would be joined by more than 30 foreign royals, along with wider family and friends of Philip, who died last April, aged 99. His funeral at Windsor was limited to just 30 people due to Covid restrictions. The Duke of York will be among the congregation at the Abbey, but the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, the youth scheme set up by Philip in 1956, will feature prominently during the service. The Band of the Royal Marines will provide music before and after the event, which is being broadcast live on BBC One (10.30am). A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: "The service will give thanks for the Duke of Edinburgh's dedication to family, nation and Commonwealth. And recognise the importance of his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting environmental stewardship and conservation, and supporting the Armed Forces. "The service will in particular pay tribute to his contribution to public life and steadfast support for the over 700 charitable organisations with which His Royal Highness was associated throughout his life."
