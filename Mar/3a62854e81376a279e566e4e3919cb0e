Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has insisted that every Formula One team on the grid is standing in solidarity with Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing military invasion of the country. This year's Russian Grand Prix has already been cancelled by the organisation, while their contract with the event's promoter was ripped up last week to ensure there will be no future races in the country in light of recent events. Ukraine was invaded by land, air and sea at the end of last month after Russian troops were given the green light to launch a full-scale military operation by president Vladimir Putin.A number of world leaders have since condemned Putin's actions by accusing him of breaking international law and hitting his country and government with a number of heavy sanctions.The sporting world has also rallied around Ukraine after a selection of international organisations, teams and athletes opted to boycott Russia in the days since the beginning of the invasion.However, the FIA have decided against following this trend by ruling that Russian and Belarusian drivers and teams will not be banned from racing in events.Horner, though, has since insisted that all F1 teams are strongly opposed to the war in Ukraine. JUST IN: Verstappen admits he may have 'more motivation' to beat Hamilton The Red Bull chief appeared on BBC Breakfast on Monday to shed light on the common views that were discussed in a meeting which took place to decide the fate of the Russian Grand Prix last month."It's shocking to see what's going on in the world," said Horner."Sport is almost irrelevant at a time when you see what's going on like that. Certainly Formula One, all the teams, took a very strong position last time we were all last together about 10 days ago."We knew we needed to take a firm position with this and obviously the Russian Grand Prix has been cancelled, the contracts turn up. "The team that had a Russian sponsor [Haas] and Russian driver [Nikita Mazepin] has decided they're going to remove the driver, so it's very difficult."Formula One as a community will come together and look to do something positive [to support Ukraine], we're all together."It's not often we all agree on something but this is a subject that absolutely there's unification throughout all of the teams and participants." Horner's comments were recently echoed by none other than Lewis Hamilton, who underlined the need for those in F1 to take a stand against Russia in the wake of recent developments in Ukraine.

We are praying for you."
