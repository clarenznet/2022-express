The man was captured on camera as he cycled through a nature reserve in Tameside, Manchester, with an “erect member”. A passer-by was shocked after spotting the man while visiting Hulme’s Wood in Denton on Tuesday. They warned residents of the nudist on Facebook. The post read: “I've just been walking down Hulme’s Wood. There's a guy riding down there naked with an erect member. "It's been reported to the police. If you see him please report.” They added: “There are a lot of lone women who walk here daily as I do. Please be careful. He has long dark hair.” Other Facebook users expressed their concern. One person said: “Honestly scares me walking down the woods and even more so seeing this.” Another wrote: “He’s ruined my happy place.” Hulme’s Wood runs alongside the River Tame. It features a popular footpath leading towards Haughton Dale and is a favoured beauty spot by residents in the Manchester area. It has been described as a “wild gem”. Manchester Evening News contacted the Greater Manchester Police about the incident.
