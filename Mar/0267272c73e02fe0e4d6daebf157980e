Nine young cows escaped a farmer's field in Middlewich, Cheshire, in the evening of Monday, March 14. The animals made the most of their newfound freedom by exploring the local area. A number of the cows headed to a nearby street and gathered in front of two properties. A picture shows the animals standing awkwardly by the front doors of the houses as they stare through the windows. The hilarious snap was shared on Twitter by Lymm Fire Station.  Fire crews from Lymm, Middlewich and Bollington were called to return the cows to their field. While most of the animals appeared to congregate in the front gardens of two homes, one unfortunate cow ended up in a canal and had to be helped out.
