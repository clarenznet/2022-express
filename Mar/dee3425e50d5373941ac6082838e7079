Sophie Wessex today visited Swansea University as the patron of the Scar Free Foundation, which is investigating the use of 3D bioprinting. On this occasion, the Countess of Wessex wore her white blossom studs along with a gorgeous pink Prada coat. Sophie had previously worn this coat back in 2017 and has certainly kept it in good condition as it looks brand new.  Unfortunately the item is no longer available to purchase. Underneath the coat, Sophie could be seen wearing chic black cigarette trousers. For accessories, the Countess wore a silver chain bracelet with a charm for a little bit of glamour. She paired this with her pink stone necklace which perfectly matched her coat.
