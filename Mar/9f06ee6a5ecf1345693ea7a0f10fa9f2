The fire started on Friday evening in Montornès del Vallès, a small town in the province of Barcelona, located 14 miles from the city. Videos on social media show a huge smoke cloud blanketing the area - and citizens are advised to stay indoors. According to CCMA, the fire started shortly before 7pm local time. Twenty fire crews are working at the scene - an industrial building reportedly containing chemicals. The Spanish authorities have activated an emergency plan called PLASEQCAT (acronyms for "External Emergency Plan for the Chemical Sector of Catalonia / Tarragona").  The purpose of the plan is to effectively deal with emergencies that may result in serious accidents in industry or establishments handling hazardous chemicals. Citizens living nearby are advised to stay at home, close doors and windows and turn off any air conditioning or ventilation systems. The public media corporation of Catalonia, CCMA, reported that the burning building is a paint solvent company located in Antonio Machado Street in Montornès del Vallès. In an announcement, the local government of Catalonia said: "At 6.53pm, the Generalitat Fire Brigade was alerted to a fire affecting an industrial building on Antonio Machado Street in Montornès del Vallès.  "According to initial reports, the fire was burning in the company's courtyard, drums with flammable liquid, pallets and a tank, but by the time the troops arrived, the fire had completely affected the building. There were no workers inside." They added that fire brigades are working on extinguishing the fire, which was fully developed from the outside to contain its spread to the buildings next door, while foam and flammable liquids were spilling from the drums. The announcement said that a gas station nearby was not affected.
