A charter financial planner Pete Matthew discussed the notion of people reducing their risk when approaching retirement on his Youtube Channel. He suggested another way for people to prepare that will help them achieve their goals for retirement. Before Britons consider reducing their risk, they should know what their priorities are for their money in retirement. Mr Matthew said: “Our number one priority should be making sure we can live the life we want to live for as as we live. “If our desired lifestyle costs more than our income then we will need to draw off our capital. “But what we don’t want to have happen is that our capital runs out because we drew too heavily on it, or drew down at the wrong time.

When looking at pensions and investments approaching retirement, Britons needs to identify their risk tolerance. Mr Matthew explained that people can raise and lower their tolerance depending on their time scale. For example, if someone aged 62 wanted to book a holiday at age 70 worth £10,000, they could invest that money and put it to one side. If the value of the investment drops by the time they are 64, they will not be as worried as the market has time to build itself back up again. Mr Matthew continued: “I call this risk flexing. We flex the risk of the investments up or down, depending on how much they need and the length of time until they need it. “Practically speaking when I talk about increasing the risk, I’m talking about increasing the equity content of the investment. “There’e more to it than that, but equities remain the growth engine for most portfolios and more volatility.” Mr Matthew suggests that people should divide their money into blocks. Year one to two, three to five, years six to 10 and 11 plus.
