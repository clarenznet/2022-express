She made her debut as a professional dancer on the show who has decided to call it quits after seven years. Dame Arlene Philips said that ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ has acted as a springboard for the dancer's career. She believes that Oti took the right decision by discontinuing from the show as it is the ‘right time’ for her.  She said: "In a few years' time she will have her own perfume. It absolutely is the right time now for Oti to leave. She won't just jump and do things because they are there. She will choose the career she wants.” She continued: "Her career is flourishing and it should do. She is amazing - she is funny and works, works, works.The world is now her oyster and she has worked really hard. Hard work pays off in the end.You have got to put the years in and the time. And you have to take the s*** jobs to build up.” Choreographer Arlene Philips and Oti Mabuse have worked together on a Cher musical that tours the UK in April. Dame Arlene, 78, was a judge on Strictly from 2004 to 2009. Oti, 31,  joined the series in 2015 and became the first dancer to win the show twice in a row, with Kelvin Fletcher in 2019 and Bill Bailey in 2020. Oti Mabuse who is also a judge on Dancing On Ice, recently performed with her husband Marius Lepure, 39 in a sheer golden bodysuit with sequins, tassels, and mirrored tiles. Oti, who is from Pretoria, South Africa said about exiting Strictly: "I'm honestly so grateful to the BBC and will always remember that Strictly and the BBC brought me to the UK, which I now call home and I have learnt and grown so much. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
