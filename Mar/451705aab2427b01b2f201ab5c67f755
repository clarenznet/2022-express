The Champions League has reached the quarter-final stage - with just eight teams left who can lift the illustrious trophy in Paris on May 29. The Premier League has three of its four representatives still in the competition with holders Chelsea, last year's losing finalists Manchester City and Liverpool all waiting to learn their opponents. Chelsea saw off Lille 4-1 on aggregate while City eased past Sporting Lisbon with a 5-0 destruction of their Portuguese opponents in the first leg away from home. Liverpool meanwhile beat Inter Milan 2-1 over two legs despite the Italian champions winning the second leg 1-0 at Anfield. There was disappointment for Premier League rivals Manchester United though who fell 2-1 over 180 minutes to Atletico Madrid courtesy of losing 1-0 at Old Trafford this week. Elsewhere, 13-time winners Real Madrid saw off Paris Saint-Germain in a Bernabeu thriller to prevail 3-2 on aggregate. That means neither Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi will be in the last eight. Benfica stunned Ajax with a 1-0 second-leg win in Amsterdam which put them through 3-2 on aggregate despite the Dutch team having won all of their six group games. And Villarreal hammered Juventus 3-0 with three goals in the last 12 minutes this week, lifting them to a stunning 4-1 triumph overall.  Those teams now wait to learn who they will face in the next round of the tournament, and know that they will also learn their route to the final. The potential semi-final pairings will also be mapped out in Nyon, Switzerland today. You can follow the Champions League quarter-final draw LIVE with Express Sport below.
