The Sharon Watts star came back to the BBC soap sporting a slightly different appearance on Wednesday, and EastEnders fans were quick to comment on her "incredible" transformation. The 54-year-old appeared to have a different hairstyle as well as a tan, and her character wasn't wearing her usual black clothing. Taking to Twitter, viewers described her as looking "amazing" and commented she appears to have lost weight. In the soap, Letitia's character Sharon had taken a few days away from Walford with her son. This left Jada Lennox (played by Kelsey Calladine-Smith) with a free house and she decided to throw a party, which she was trying to keep from Sharon. The EastEnders stalwart's short return scene on Wednesday didn't last long, but viewers were quick to comment on the actress' transformation. Arriving back in the house, Sharon was met by Jada, who remarked: "You look refreshed."

Eyeing the dinner Jada had prepared, she asked: "What's all this then?" Jada explained: "Leftovers from Zack's test menu, plus candles to maintain your mellow." "I should go away more often," Sharon answered happily. Fans flooded Letitia with compliments on social media shortly after the scene aired. Twitter user Ryan wrote: "Sharon's lost some weight and had her haircut and looks amazing #EastEnders #AllHailQueenSharon." Joe Mackenzie penned: "#EastEnders Sharon has shed loads of weight, looking amazing." "Sharon looked gorgeous last night #EastEnders," Ryan Gladdening commented on Thursday. DON'T MISS...

Paul Graham added: "S***! Sharon looks stunning @bbceastenders #EastEnders." Letitia is one of the longest-serving EastEnders actors, having been in the soap on and off since the very first episode in 1985. Her character has been at the centre of some of the biggest storylines, including the memorable "Sharongate" plot. The story saw Sharon cheating on husband Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) with his brother, Phil (Steve McFadden). More recently, she lost her teenage son Denny Rickman (Bleu Landau) when a boat carrying Albert Square residents sunk. EastEnders continues on Thursday at 7.30pm on BBC One.
