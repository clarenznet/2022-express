PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and ex-PC Joel Borders, 45, are accused of sending racist and misogynistic "jokes" on WhatsApp. They all served with Couzens, who received a whole life sentence for the murder of marketing executive Sarah, 33, who was snatched from the street in South London last March. Detectives investigating the kidnap and killing discovered allegedly grossly offensive material on his phone. The Independent Office for Police Conduct was alerted and inquiries led to the three men being charged. Yesterday, they made a brief appearance at Westminster magistrates' court in central London. Cobban, of Oxfordshire, and Borders, of Lancashire, each denied five charges of sending by a public communication network, an offensive, indecent, obscene, or menacing message.Neville, of Surrey, denied two similar charges. The alleged offences took place in April, June and August 2019 when the defendants and Couzens were serving on a Met Police armed protection unit. Jocelyn Ledward, prosecuting, told the court: "There is likely to be certain evidence from the officer in the case about the phrases used. "The fact these officers undertook certain kinds of training is in the evidence. The content of the training course has been gathered as best as can be done."  Paul Goldspring, Chief Magistrate for England and Wales, asked: "So they should have known the content of the messages they were sending was grossly offensive, that's the point of the evidence?" Ms Ledward replied: "Exactly. Judge Goldspring said: "It's a straight enough issue for the trial judge to determine whether the messages are grossly offensive." Nicholas Yeo, defending, said: "The issues are, firstly, whether or not the messages were grossly offensive and, secondly, whether the jokes were intended to be grossly offensive or whether they were not aware." Cobban, Neville and Borders are on unconditional bail until their two-day trial at the same court starting on July 28.
