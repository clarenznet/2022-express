On a Caribbean tour where the legacy of empire has loomed large despite it supposedly being about celebrating the Queen’s 70-year reign, he and Kate have been in a difficult position. His speech at King’s House in Kingston was never going to placate critics.  For at least 150 years from the reign of Elizabeth I the Royal Family profited from slavery but the public here and in Britain appears divided over whether the modern monarchy should apologise for that. Should every US president apologise ritually for the fact that more than one in four of their predecessors kept slaves? Should the US dollar bill, federal capital, and a Pacific Northwest state celebrate George Washington, who had 123 slaves at Mount Vernon when he died? Or should we see people in the context of what was acceptable in their time and not judge them by today’s standards?  The Cambridges have received a warm welcome from ordinary people on this tour. Many have said that issues such as apologising for slavery, paying reparations, and ending the monarchy are not high on their list of priorities compared to youth unemployment, crime, housing and other economic and social issues. But there is a sense that political leaders in much of the Caribbean have decided that now is the time to break free from the last ties of empire by ending the monarchy. William, Kate, and the rest of their family will be happy to accept whatever they decide but will hope Britain can continue to enjoy close ties with the people of the Caribbean.
