John Gargett called the police after noticing the two silver Mercedes-Benz parked next to each other on his road in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. The resident, who says he has been fighting crime for his whole adult life, was alarmed by the peculiar sight. It is illegal for two vehicles to carry the same plate. These registrations are designed to not only be able to trace the owner of a vehicle, but identify the car itself when necessary. John said: "Two cars parked across the street were on the same number plate front and rear. "I reported this to 101. This was given a priority 8, and two PCSOs attended."  South Yorkshire Police confirmed they sent officers to the street and spoke to the owners, Yorkshire Live reports. According to the police, the identical vehicles are registered for different plates although one of the vehicles is being used for spare parts.  Officers say the identical number plates were placed on the wrong vehicle, but did not offer explanations as to how this may have happened. "Advice has been given and the mistake is being rectified," a spokesman for South Yorkshire Constabulary said. Changes to licence plates design this week had drivers worried. The plates are made from a tougher material, which makes them more resistant to abrasion and other damage, but now have to include the supplier’s business name and postcode, along with the name of the number plate manufacturer and the new standard. Those changes have prompted fears of cars being tracked without permission.
