Charles's comment came during a visit to Essex to present Southend with the Letters Patent, granting it city status, following the death of MP Sir David Amess. Lady Amess was presented with the freedom of the City of Southend on behalf of her late husband. Earlier, Her Majesty was pictured hosting audiences online, inset right, with ambassadors, for the first time since her Covid diagnosis. The head of state's recovery was clearly progressing as she appeared via video link in a green dress and a large brooch, with her regualr pearls, from Windsor Castle. She was speaking to diplomats from the Republic of Chad and the Principality of Andorra who were at Buckingham Palace. The Queen had to postpone similar engagements last week. She tested positive for the virus on February 20 and Buckingham Palace said she had been experiencing "mild cold-like symptoms". She has also been forced to cancel events due to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Charles's encouraging words about his mother came during a stroll with Camilla on Southend seafront. Janice Jacom, 64, an administration worker from a local golf course, asked about the Queen's health. Janice said: "I asked the prince about his mother and he said 'She's a lot better now â€“ it was very mild'."
