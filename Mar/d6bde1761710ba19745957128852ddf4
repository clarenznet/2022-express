Rafael Nadal has been heralded for his commitment to his career by Roger Federer's ex-coach and fellow Spaniard Jose Higueras after he won the Mexican Open last week.  Nadal, 35, beat the likes of Stefan Kozlov and world No.1 Daniil Medvedev on his way to clinching his second tournament of the calendar year. The Spanish star won every single set of the tournament in Acapulco on his way to a memorable win, beating British star Cameron Norrie in the final. And following his Australian Open win over Medvedev - despite trailing 2-0 after two sets in the final at the Rod Laver Arena - Nadal has shown his total professionalism by battling back to win titles in the face of defeat. And former Spanish tennis star Higueras has praised Nadal as his game continues to develop, even at the veteran age of 35.  "At this stage of Rafa's career, I would say he is a more complete player than ever," Higueras said. "If he is not the most complete player on the Tour, he is certainly at the very top. "If you follow his entire career and matches, you will notice he always does something better than on the previous day, introducing things he never had before. "If that was something he had in his arsenal in the past, he is doing that better now." Nadal admitted himself that he put in a good performance against the world's best player last Saturday in what was a 'difficult game' against Russian star Medvedev. And he could not hide his delight at overcoming the challenge posed by his opponent. "I played some amazing points on those break points," said Nadal. "In the second set, Daniil was playing very aggressive, it was a very difficult set. I feel lucky to win that set.  "I'm really happy with the way I played, against the number one player in the world, and happy to play in the final." Nadal's form means he is in genuine contention to win all four Grand Slam titles in the calendar. And he will aim to continue that when he makes his way to the French Open at the end of May.
