Writing on Instagram, Mr Hodgson revealed the Queen likes marmite in her fried mushrooms for breakfast. He also recounted a hilarious story about a royal chef who thought he was cooking for the Queen, but it turned out it was for her corgis.  Mr Hodgson revealed how chefs at the palace cooked eggs quickly for the hundreds of staff working there every day. He said: “Eventually after some more weeks past I got to start making breakfasts. “With nearly 600+ staff in each day Buck House was a busy kitchen. “We fried eggs in Yorkshire pudding trays under the salamander 30 at a time.”  A salamander is a high temperature overhead grill usually found in professional kitchens. It’s usually used for toasting or browning off food. This was much quicker than frying dozens and dozens of eggs in a pan. There is a good reason that so many people work at Buckingham Palace.
