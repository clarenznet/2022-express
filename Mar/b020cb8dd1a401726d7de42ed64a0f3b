The woman said she didn't realise she had not selected a bag with her order when she used the self-service machine at the fast-food restaurant in Drylaw, Edinburgh. When she became aware of her mistake and asked for a bag, the mother claimed she was refused one as she didn't have a spare 10p. She said she only had the amount already paid and did not have the extra cash. Trying to get the food home as quickly as possible for her disabled mother and children, the woman had been forced to carry it all in her hands, before being helped by the nearby pub. Furious about the incident, the mum shared her frustration on TripAdvisor, writing: "I mistakenly pressed 'no bag' on the self service screens and didn't have an extra 10p to give the staff. "I explained it was a mistake and I was refused a paper sack from the manager. Its' not even a bag, the bags have handles.  "I had to leave the restaurant to go into the pub next door to ask for a bag to carry my food home to my disabled mother and the kids who were waiting. "I was more than upset at the manager for the heartless way she handled it. Then when I got home she didn't even give me the full order, two quarter pounders were missing. "So not only that the manager wouldn't help me, she also didn't give me everything on my order so I lost out on £7. Over 10p. This is absolutely shocking and I will be leaving a review on all sites. "I wont be back and neither will my family or friends."  The establishment has an average rating of just two stars out of five on TripAdvisor, reports Edinburgh Live. More than half of its reviews are "terrible", with people complaining about long waits and receiving incorrect orders. In response to the mum's incident, a McDonald’s spokesperson said: "We are very sorry to hear about this customer’s experience and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused. "We would encourage the customer to contact our customer services team directly to help find a resolution."
