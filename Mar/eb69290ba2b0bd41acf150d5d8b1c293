Android phone owners that are looking to upgrade their handset need to know about a money-saving deal available right now. Mobiles.co.uk is offering anyone thinking of picking up a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro handset a big incentive to sign up to a new contract as the retailer is throwing in £50 worth of Google Play Store credit entirely for free on a range of plans. This freebie is available on Pixel 6 plans with prices starting from under £20. These plans with low monthly payments, however, require upfront payments of a few hundred pounds. If you want the best of both worlds and don't want to spend too much upfront or each month then Express.co.uk has a few top picks. The cheapest of which is a Pixel 6 contract that offers 30GB of monthly 5G data, plus unlimited texts and minutes for £26 a month. You will have to pay £89 upfront as well, with this Vodafone deal working out as £713 over the course of the two year contract. Considering the Pixel 6 costs £599 SIM-free this effectively means you're paying under £5 a month for the Vodafone SIM.  That's an incredibly low price, and is much better value than the cheapest Vodafone SIM-only deal available on the market. That SIM costs £11 a month and offers just 1GB of monthly 5G data. Alternatively, if you want more data to play with you can also get a Pixel 6 with 100GB of monthly 5G Vodafone data for £30 a month with a £45 upfront payment. This works out as a bit more than the 30GB deal over the course of a two year contract, costing £765 in total as opposed to £713. If you're after the best Google handset money can buy, then Mobiles.co.uk are also throwing in the free £50 Play Store voucher with the Pixel 6 Pro. A range of deals are available, including one plan for the 128GB model (which costs £849 on its own) priced at £43 a month with a £45 upfront payment. For that price though you'll get unlimited 5G data, text and minutes from Vodafone.
