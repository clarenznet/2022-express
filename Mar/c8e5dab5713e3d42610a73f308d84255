The Facebook LIVE will be held at 2pm tomorrow so set your clocks! You will have the opportunity to follow along and have your say in the comment section as our Royal Correspondent delivers the very latest on the British Monarchy. This week they will be discussing the latest developments in the Royal Family as both Camilla Duchess of Cornwall and the Queen continue to recover from health ordeals. The discussion will take place as speculation swirls over the Queens commitments this year and Camilla continues to pace herself while recovering from Covid-19. As of today, Camilla will no longer head to the ongoing Cheltenham Festival. Our Royal correspondent Richard Palmer said: “It’s understood she is trying to pace herself as she recovers from the bout of COVID-19 she had last month. "She had looked as if she was struggling at an engagement yesterday." Meanwhile, the latest updates on the Queen’s health have worried royal watchers after our 95-year-old monarch was forced to pull out of a Commonwealth Service recently. The cancellation wasn't caused by any new illness but over concerns she would find it too taxing to spend an hour standing at the service. Prince Charles was asked to represent her at the service instead and many have been calling for the Queen to take a break from her duties as she appears increasingly frail since the death of Prince Charles. What’s more, the Queen's aides are said to be taking her two corgis as she becomes increasingly frail. Matters concerning the Queen's health have always been a closely guarded secret kept by the Palace. But can this continue? And furthermore, what does this mean for the Royal Family? Keep an eye on our Instagram and social stories for more updates, information and what to expect from these weekly royal specials in which Richard and Pandora will be discussing everything on the Royal beat.
