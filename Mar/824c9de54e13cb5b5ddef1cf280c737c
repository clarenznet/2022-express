Zara Tindall, 40, and her husband Mike Tindall, 43, both attended the Six Nations match on Saturday. The match was between England and Ireland, with the royal couple in full support for England to win.  Zara stunned in Woodstock blue with her £275 Russell and Bromley ‘Quince’ bag. The chained handbag is beautifully designed in navy suede leather and has been worn by the royal many times before. It features an adjustable shoulder strap and is large enough for daily essentials. The bag is perfect with an all-black ensemble for a sophisticated finish.
