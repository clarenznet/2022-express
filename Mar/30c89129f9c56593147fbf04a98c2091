Holly Willoughby looked stunning in a sequinned asymmetrical gown with a peach-coloured feathered shoulder as she attended a Studio 54-themed bash. The ITV star, 41, partied with her husband Dan Baldwin in London today. Holly’s gorgeous dress featured colour-blocking with metallic shades of red, blue, purple and green, while the feathered sleeve draped over her left arm. The mum-of-three accessorised with a silver handbag and sparkly stiletto sandals in a blue metallic hue, matching the dress. Her blonde tresses fell in loose waves while her eye makeup featured bright blue sparkly eyeshadow, reminiscent of the colourful era. Not to be outshone, producer Dan donned a cream-coloured suede coat with shearling trimming and black flared trousers. The couple were celebrating the 4th anniversary of exclusive members’ club Annabel’s in London. Also in attendance were Rod Stewart with his wife Penny Lancaster, and supermodel Naomi Campbell. Holly was all smiles despite having a rather alarming day at work yesterday when Television Centre London was evacuated, pulling This Morning off air as a pre-recorded segment was played instead. It came as a security alert was issued due to a package sent to Lorraine Kelly which contained a battery that roused suspicion - before the police investigated and ensured the parcel contained nothing harmful.
