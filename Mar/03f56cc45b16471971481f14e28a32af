He suffered cardiac arrest after being set on by one of three dogs dubbed "the beasts" by a neighbour in Egdon, Worcestershire. The boy was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital on Monday but died of his injuries.  The dogs were quickly removed to secure accommodation. Police have not confirmed the breeds but one neighbour said they are Rottweilers. Another said: "We call them 'the beasts' because they are always making such a racket. Everyone is so sad."
