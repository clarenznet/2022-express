Forty former employees will get at least £100,000, with ­payouts linked to service, the ­company said. In some cases the ­payments are more than £170,000. It is believed to be the largest ­compensation offer in the British marine sector. P&O Ferries said the total financial settlement will be £36,541,648. But the move failed to ease the row. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “The package is pure blackmail – if staff do not sign and give away their jobs and their legal right to take the company to an employment ­tribunal, they will get a fraction of the amount put to them.” The Nautilus union said: “P&O Ferries believes with enough money it has no need to follow the laws.” Around 575 of the 786 crew are in discussions over the severance offers. No employee will get less than £15,000 while they are also being given support to find a new job at sea or onshore, the company said. P&O Ferries said: “This has been an incredibly tough decision for the business – to make this choice or ­face taking the company into administration.” P&O plans to pay two and a half weeks’ uncapped salary for each year employed rather than the statutory one or 1.5 weeks and up to 13 weeks’ ­salary in lieu of notice. There will also be 13 weeks’ salary on top of this in absence of consultation. But Business Minister Paul Scully ­yesterday warned P&O could face prosecution and an unlimited fine if it is considered to have broken the law over the mass sackings. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The Government needs to hit the firm where it hurts. “That means suspending all of P&O’s licenses immediately and ­cancelling its lucrative freeport ­contracts until all workers have been reinstated.” Protests have been staged at ports across the UK, including one ­outside Parliament yesterday.
