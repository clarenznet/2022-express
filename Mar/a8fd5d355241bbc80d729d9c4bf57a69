Nadhim Zahawi will set out his vision for schools over the next decade in the long-awaited Schools White Paper. The proposals include a plan for children falling behind in English and maths to get extra support. Under the Government’s pledge, schools will identify pupils at risk and offer them a range of support, including tutoring sessions. Parents will be kept informed of their progress. Mr Zahawi, below, said: “Any child who falls behind in maths or English will get the support they need to get back on track, and schools will also be asked to offer at least a 32.5-hour school week by September 2023.” Boris Johnson said: “We are making a pledge to every parent – if your child falls behind at school in either of these key subjects, their school will help them get back on track. “By making sure every child receives excellent teaching we will spread opportunity and future proof our mission to level up the country.” Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, explained: “Increasing the parental engagement through the ‘parent pledge’ will help break down long standing and often complicated barriers that exist, to help increase attendance. “Especially in relation to the 124,000 ‘ghost children’ who have dropped out of the school system following the outbreak of the pandemic.” The Government said the Education Endowment Foundation charity will receive £100million in funding, to evaluate the best teaching practice and spread this across the country. The White Paper also announced 500,000 teacher training opportunities and pledged to raise startingsalaries to £30,000.
