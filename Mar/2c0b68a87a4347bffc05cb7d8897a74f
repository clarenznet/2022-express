Julia Roberts, 54, has now been one of Hollywood’s most recognisable faces for decades. However, the actress looked very different in her early acting days. In a new series of pictures from the 80s, Julia sported her short, shoulder-length hair teased in a voluminous hairstyle. Her now-usual middle or side parts were nowhere to be seen as she opted for a classic fringe. Julia’s ethereal facial features stood out as her hair fell either side of her face. In the pictures, Julia Roberts could be seen posing alongside Eric Robertsand Jon Voight. The trio had attended the 1985 Premiere of Runaway Train and Fool For Love at Plaza Hotel in New York City.
