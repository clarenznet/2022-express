The draw for the semi-finals of the FA Cup took place this evening just before Nottingham Forest's last-eight clash against Liverpool. Chelsea became the first team through to the final four when they comfortably saw off Middlesbrough on Saturday. And their reward was a tie against Crystal Palace, who thrashed Everton 4-0 in front of a raucous Selhurst Park on Sunday lunchtime. Manchester City did not have things all their own way, but eventually came out on top to beat Southampton 4-1 at St Mary's. And they will face the winners of Forest vs Liverpool, which kicks off at 6pm. Here is a look back at the draw as it happened...
