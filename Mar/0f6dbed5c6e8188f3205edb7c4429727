Barcelona are stepping up their efforts to land Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen and Manchester United target Franck Kessie on free transfers ahead of next season, according to reports. The Catalan giants are widely expected to be busy in the upcoming summer window as Xavi looks to improve his ranks after the club's lacklustre start to the current campaign. Barcelona have struggled financially in recent years and their off-field problems were clearly reflected by their on-pitch performances during the first half of the season.They slumped to a number of demoralising defeats in La Liga under former boss Ronald Koeman before failing to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in 21 years.Xavi has since managed to steady the ship and get Barcelona firing once again after no less than four new players were signed as part of a fruitful January recruitment drive.The likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Adama Traore and Ferran Torres have settled in well and look set to play a key role in shaping Barcelona's fortunes between now and the end of the campaign.It seems as though Xavi has already started to prepare for another busy window ahead of next season by accelerating the club's interest in Christensen and Kessie in advance of the summer months. JUST IN: Solskjaer has already told Rangnick how Man Utd can beat Man City The former is keen on joining Barcelona after deciding to leave Chelsea upon the expiry of his current deal in the summer, according to Mundo Deportivo.It is said that Barcelona officials travelled to London earlier this week in an attempt to make progress in talks with the Dane, who has failed to strike an agreement with the Blues over an extension to his current contract.Xavi is reportedly satisfied that Christensen fits the profile he is looking for at Barcelona and will push to rubber-stamp the move over the coming weeks.Meanwhile, Barcelona have also taken plenty of recent steps to accelerate their pursuit of Kessie, who has refused to sign a new contract with AC Milan despite having been offered a significant pay rise. The Ivory Coast international has been heavily linked with a summer move to United in recent months but is now said to be warming to the idea of moving to the Nou Camp.Xavi is believed to be a huge admirer of Kessie and is planning on making him Barcelona's only midfield signing ahead of next season.The midfielder has recently been whistled by Milan fans after turning down the offer of a new deal at the San Siro and it is said that his proposed move to Spain could be officially announced before the summer in order to ease tensions.It remains to be seen how Chelsea and United will respond if Barcelona manage to complete deals for both Christensen and Kessie over the coming days.
