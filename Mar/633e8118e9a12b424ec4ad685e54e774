Lewis Hamilton was confused over F1's scoring system and sought clarification from his chief engineer following the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Hamilton had a disappointing weekend and only just scraped into the points places. The Brit's 10th-placed finish means Hamilton has scored one championship point, the lowest number drivers can receive on an F1 weekend. When Hamilton first started in 2007, F1 used to issue points to the top six but extended this to the top 10 from the 2010 season. Hamilton has also been towards the front of the field since the turbo-hybrid era in 2014 meaning he has been fighting for the maximum 25 points - hence his confusion over how many points he scored. Mercedes engineer Peter Bonnington apologised to Hamilton after he crossed the chequered flag. He said: "OK Lewis, that's P10. Sorry about that." Hamilton replied: “Is there even a point for that position?"
