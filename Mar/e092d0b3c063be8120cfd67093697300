The monarch acquired the Â£62,000 electric vehicle - dubbed the Queenmobile in reference to the Popemobile used by various pontiffs - two weeks ago. Aides have already taken the 95-year-old head of state and her pet corgis out in the 43mph four-seater cart. A source said: "She's battled stiffness in her legs recently so the cart is perfect." Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales is being lined up to stand in for his mother at the State Opening of Parliament on May 10 in case any health problems arise. The monarch has only missed the event twice during her reign, but has been joined by Prince Charles in recent years. Plans are in place for Charles or Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor, to read the Queen's Speech for her. A source told a Sunday paper: "The date is in Her Majesty's diary, and she hopes to attend." The Queen spent a night in hospital last October and pulled out of a series of high-profile engagements as a result. Since then she has been using a walking stick, right, and a wheelchair. She recently commented on her mobility issues: "Well, as you can see, I can't move."
