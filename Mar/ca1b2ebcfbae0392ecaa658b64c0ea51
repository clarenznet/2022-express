A rare and unique opportunity has arisen for hot tub enthusiasts to get paid to sit and enjoy the bubbles. To mark National Hot Tub Day on March 28, hot tub brand Lay-Z-Spa has launched a search for what it has dubbed "a hot tubologist" to test its award-winning range of hot tubs, Liverpool Echo reports.  The successful candidate will get to try out a hot tub from their range before rating it for bubbliness, relaxation, socialisation, and impact on their happiness. The dream job will see the lucky applicant paid £500 for only five hours of work to test Lay-Z-Spa’s Santorini HydroJet Pro hot tub - meaning a whopping payment of £100 per hour of relaxation. The hot tub itself is worth £1,299. The winning candidate will also feature on Lay-Z-Spa’s social media, sharing their expert opinion on the hot tub as the company’s brand ambassador. This means that they would be reaching over 130,000 followers on Lay-Z-Spa’s social media channels.  Lay-Z-Spas says its products have flown off the shelves in recent years, with consumers racing to get their very own at-home spa experience before they sell out. Applicants for the hot tub job need to submit 150 words about why they would make the best Hot Tubologist with reasons for why they are a deserving winner, along with a selfie of themselves with the space they’d put the Santorini HydroJet Pro if they were to win, to www.lay-z-spa.co.uk/hot-tubologist.Eligible candidates must be over 18 years old, and UK residents.The applications open on Monday, March 28 at 10am and close on Sunday, April 10, 2022 at midnight.
