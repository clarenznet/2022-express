The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have embarked on a royal tour of the Caribbean at the moment as they hope to boost support for the Crown in the Commonwealth following Barbados' decision to become a republic. Prince William, Kate Middleton and son Prince George had previously been described as republican slayers after support for the Royal Family spiked following their visit to Australia. The land Down Under, while far away from Barbados, has long grappled with its relationship with the monarchy. A referendum was held on the issue in 1999, in which the monarchists came out on top by almost 10 percent. However, in 2016, William and Kate shared a terrifying moment while on a lengthy tour to India. The moment came when the couple visited Kaziranga National Park, which homes tigers and elephants.

As much as Myanmar was a long-way from the park, tremors were reportedly felt at Kaziranga National Park. Royal reporters who joined the press pack were said to have been checking into hotels when the earthquake hit. Katie Nicholl, a member of the group and the current royal editor at Vanity Fair, previously told Yahoo's Royal Box: "We were checking into our hotel when the ground was literally shaking, trembling. "The chandeliers were shaking, we evacuated the hotel very, very quickly. "The Duke and Duchess were out in a field, in a hut on stilts. It was a terrifying moment for them. "William needed a stiff drink after that, as did Kate." The Cambridges' spokesperson confirmed the couple were safe and well shortly afterwards.
