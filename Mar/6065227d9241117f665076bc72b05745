Russell Gritton, 29, tripped on a metal mooring ring and plunged several feet into the Limehouse Cut in east London as he dodged the shameless cyclist. Witnesses rushed to Russell's aid but he was left bruised and bloodied on Thursday last week. The cyclist asked if he was ok but then suggested: "You should get out," to which outraged Russell said: "Cool, thanks. Helpful. It’s not a spa day, I’m not just going to hang out down here." The doctor, who lives in Stepney, east London, was running along the towpath as part of his marathon training when the cyclist came down the towpath, forcing him into the dirty water. Speaking to My London, Russell said: "My first thought was: 'Oh no, my phone is f****d. Great, if I survive this, I won't have a phone.' "About four-feet below the water there is this layer of sludge that you can sort of stand on but you start sinking into. I was trying not to think about what was in there, I was just going to use it to stand on and deal with it later psychologically. I’m sure it was probably a dead gangster’s face I was standing on. "A man appeared on a boat and he lifted me out of the water like a child by my arms. I just had to accept I really did look quite pathetic. "My upper body is not fantastic. I was just sort of flailing at this boat."  The man on the boat helped Russell get home, where he is recovering. He was surprised to find his phone is still working. But the experience has put Russell off from running alongside canals in future. He suggests other fitness fanatics should instead train at large recreation grounds, like Victoria Park in Tower Hamlets, east London.
