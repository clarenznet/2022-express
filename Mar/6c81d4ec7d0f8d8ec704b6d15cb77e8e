   Dancing On Ice presenter Phillip Schofield could be seen mocking co-host Holly Willoughby ahead of their appearance on the ITV show tonight. Hilarity ensued as the glamorous star appeared to be holding up rehearsals after she failed time and time again to guess today’s Wordle.     This Morning duo Holly, 41, and Phillip, 59, appeared on screens tonight to present the latest episode of Dancing On Ice. However, a couple of hours before the show began, Phillip shared some amusing updates while the pair prepared backstage. Taking to Instagram, Phillip shared co-star Holly’s “struggles” with his three million followers. “No spoilers here obviously,” he began. “But Holly is really struggling with today’s Wordle. She’s really struggling with it.”       “I’ve got two more letters left! How can it be this hard?” Holly interjected. “Nobody tell me anything.” “No one’s saying anything otherwise we’d get killed for spoiling it on here!” Phillip added. “I don’t understand, there are no words that exist like this,” Holly Lamented. This earned a laugh from Phillip, who exclaimed: “Yes there are! It’s a word you know.”        Wordle is an online game that releases a five-letter word just once a day, with players getting just six tries to get it right. Next, Holly could be seen on the studio floor, glued to her phone, as crew members gathered around to help her solve the puzzle. “Kneeling on the floor now,” Phillip began, as another member of staff called: “We’re ready, Holly! Ready when you are.” “Well, we can’t come to rehearsal because Holly hasn’t got the letter yet,” Phillip told him with a grin. READ MORE...
