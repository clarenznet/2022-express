While Britons who have reached state pension age have been spared from paying National Insurance in the past, next year they will be expected to pay a 1.25 percent Health and Social Care Levy. It’s left campaigners worried about how people, especially pensioners, will manage to make ends meet. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is pressing ahead with the hike in National Insurance in just a few weeks time, despite the fact that Britons are already struggling. The Government says the increase is necessary in order to raise £12billion to fund social care and the NHS. From 2023/24, pensioners will be expected to pay the levy too as anyone earning more than £184 a week will be expected to contribute to the Health and Social Care levy. Campaigners say it will add further pressure to households who are already finding it tough to survive.

National Insurance will rise 1.25 percentage points from April. The new rate of 13.25 percent will apply to people paying the Class 1 National Insurance rate on income between £184 to £967 a week (£797 to £4,189 a month). An employee earning £20,000 a year will have to fork out an extra £130. Anyone on a £50,000 salary will have to find an additional £505. Anyone aged 16 or over must pay National Insurance if they are working and earning above the threshold. Some will lose more than others - research carried out by Income Tax UK found that those earning an average salary of £30,000, will lose nine percent of their salary. Britons earning £50,000 will see 10 percent of their earnings lost to National Insurance. However, Britons on a salary of around £100,000 will see only seven percent of their salary go towards National Insurance.  What is happening where you live?

Adrian Lowery, personal finance expert at ISA and SIPP platform Bestinvest says people can cut their NI and income tax bill, while also boosting their retirement savings. They can choose to sacrifice their salary and pay the difference into a pension alongside their usual contributions, he said. Mr Lowry suggested: "Both employee and employer will pay lower National Insurance contributions as a result.”
