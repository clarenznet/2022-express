Some senior royals are said to have been “dismayed” at the decision, a public act of forgiveness for her son. However, Her Majesty and the rest were there to honour the life of Prince Philip, her beloved husband for over 70 years. At 95 years of age, if she wanted to be flanked by Andrew then that was her choice and that should be respected. ----------------------------------------------- Fitting gesture for Queen to choose Prince Andrew We ALL have our views on certain situations but for me Prince Andrew escorting our Queen at Prince Philip’s memorial service was a fitting gesture of love (“‘This has cast a shadow over tribute to the Duke’”, March 30). I would like to think we can all move on and make the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee year a happy one. Annette Hale, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset ----------------------------------------------- Monarch plays a blinder with display of loyal unity The Queen plays yet another masterstroke by bringing Andrew to escort her from Windsor to the service. It brought a sense of family unity and avoided awkwardness at the post-service reception. We salute you, Ma’am. Michael Hilder, Weymouth, Dorset ----------------------------------------------- Act of forgiveness beacon of light for Royal Family How typical of the Queen’s sound judgment to choose Prince Andrew to accompany her into Westminster Abbey for the thanksgiving service. After the long-running saga about her son’s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein and sex allegations, Andrew has become bad news for the Royal Family. But he has not been found guilty of anything. The Queen demonstrated her forgiving nature by giving him a high-profile role at the service. Jennefer Marston, Walsall, W Mids ----------------------------------------------- Philip would have agreed with his wife’s choice Prince Philip would have been proud of his wife. He would expect his son Prince Andrew to be at his funeral and would have approved,I believe, to have him at her side taking her down the aisle. I intend buying my niece a copy of Prince Philip’s book for her birthday so she will be made aware of how much we owe him (“So much love and respect for our great-grandpapa”, March 30).
