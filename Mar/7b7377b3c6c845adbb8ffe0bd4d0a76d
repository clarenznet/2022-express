The much-anticipated Queen Mother Champion Chase will take centre stage at Cheltenham Festival on Day Two. Nicky Henderson's Shishkin is the bookies' favourite to win the 3.30pm race, though Energumene and Chacun Pour Soi are also being heavily tipped.   Rachael Blackmore, who sailed to victory in the Champion Hurdle with Honeysuckle on Day One, will be back in action today despite suffering a horror fall yesterday. The Irish ace will be looking to add to her success on Tuesday and will hope to take the illustrious Queen Mother Champion Chase crown with Envoi Allen, who is being placed with most bookies at 16/1. Blackmore admitted she's loved seeing fans back at Cheltenham after a total of 68,506 people showed up for the opening day of the showpiece event. “It was incredible, walking back down that chute. The reception we got the whole way down, this is such a special place and we missed the crowds last year," she said. "To have them back this year is just unbelievable. We were just buzzing. Last year was fantastic, but Cheltenham is about the people and they really didn’t let us down."
