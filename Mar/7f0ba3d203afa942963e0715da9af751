On Thursday P&O Ferries sacked hundreds of staff in what has been branded a “scandalous betrayal” and “completely unacceptable” action by the ferry company. The company extraordinarily sacked 800 dedicated seafarers with zero notice - and plans to replace them with foreign, cheaper labour with fewer workers' rights. Workers were subjected to a three-minute pre-recorded message from the company boss - which ended in telling them: “Your final day of employment is today.” Long-serving crew members were removed without warning - with some staff reporting they were taken from ships by force. Outraged by the decision, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the move as a "vicious example of despotic employer behaviour" and called for demonstrations in Dover, Liverpool and Hull today. So, do you think P&O should be banned from sailing to and from Britain and in British waters? What do you think the Government should do about the stunt?
