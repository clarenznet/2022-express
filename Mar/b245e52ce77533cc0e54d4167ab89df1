"This is a very different situation than my dad, when I talked about betrayal, betrayal comes from someone you have a relationship with. "I don't feel comfortable speaking about people I really don't know but I grew up as an only child, which everyone who grew up around me knows, and I wished I had siblings, I would have loved to have siblings, that's why I am so excited to be pregnant so Archie will have someone. 'It was really interesting... the last time I saw her must have been at least 18, 19 years ago and before that, 10 years before that."
