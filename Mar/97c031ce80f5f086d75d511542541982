Speaking at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool, Ms Truss defended Britain’s history and called for an end to the “culture of self-doubt”. She said: “We have to be proud of our country, and our long standing commitment to freedom and democracy. Now is the time to end the culture of self-doubt: The constant self-questioning and introspection; the ludicrous debates about [language], statues and pronouns. “Our history – warts and all – is what makes us what we are today. We live in a great country, a great democracy and we should be proud of it.” The prime minister also defended Britain’s tradition of personal freedom but said people did not have to embrace “woke” ideas. He said: “I’ll tell you something. It is the invincible strength of this country that we believe by and large and within the law that people should be able to do whatever they want provided they don’t do any harm to anybody else. And that’s called freedom [and] we don’t need to be woke, we just want to be free. “And that’s why talented people are fleeing Russia quite frankly right now and that’s why they are flocking to the UK.” What is happening where you live?
