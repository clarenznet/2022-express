Rod Stewart, 77, took to Instagram last night to share a loved-up picture with his wife, Penny Lancaster, 50. The pop star and his model wife put on a cosy display as they enjoyed some drinks last night. The couple looked fabulous as they stepped out for an event at Annabel’s Private Members' Club in Mayfair, London. Rod and Penny opted for matching outfits in silver tones - with the musician wearing a snazzy floral-print blazer. However, Penny stole the show in a silver mini dress and knee-high boots that put her long, toned legs on display. She complemented the look with some sparkly curtain earrings and chose to wear her long blonde hair down. Rod captioned the glitzy snap: “Long live ‘studio 54’ @annabelsmayfair”.
