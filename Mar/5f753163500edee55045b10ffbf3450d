Hannah Harris, 23, tricked the boy's parents by texting them and claiming to be the mother of his fictional girlfriend. She would drive him to buy him sweets, take him to McDonald's and let him smoke cannabis in her car, St Albans Crown Court heard. But Harris, who worked at a school in Hoddesdon, Herts, was caught in 2020 when the boy's older brother found out. Harris, of Henlow, Beds, had denied four charges of sexual activity with a child, but was convicted in February of one count - the car park incident. She must serve three years in jail and the rest on licence. Harris will be put on the sex offenders register indefinitely. Judge CarolineWigin told Harris: "Your conduct has had a devastating effect upon the life of that young man."
