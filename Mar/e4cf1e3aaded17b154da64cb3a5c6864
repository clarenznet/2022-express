Chloe wore a sequined purple gown as she walked the red carpet. The one-shouldered dress featured beaded embellishments over the chest. This then flowed into a mesh skirt, which flowed out behind her as she wowed onlookers. The look also featured a high split, showing off the starâ€™s toned legs. Reaching up to her waist, the cut-out allowed her to show off her platformed purple shoes. She paired the stunning gown with some statement dangling earrings. Her sister Halle will also be presenting an award during the ceremony tonight as well.
