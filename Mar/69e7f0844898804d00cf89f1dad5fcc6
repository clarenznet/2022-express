The 1980 silver medallist and TV host compared trans women competing in female contests to drug cheats. She claimed athletes born male have an "incredibly unfair" edge over biological women rivals.   Sharron, 59, spoke out before British Cycling said Emily was ineligible to race against Dame Laura Kenny in Saturday's National Omnium Championships in Derby. The retired swimmer said: "British Cycling ought to be ashamed. Emily competed with the men's team successfully last year while reducing testosterone. This is wrong and people must start calling it out or lose sport for future generations of young girls." Emily, 21, could have competed under British Cycling's transgender and non-binary policy but she is ineligible under world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) guidelines. Sharron, who is waiting to hear if her Moscow silver will be gold after Petra Schneider of East Germany admitted doping, wants an "open" category for trans athletes.
