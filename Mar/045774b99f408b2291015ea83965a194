Big names at the Oscars tonight included Nicole Kidman, Zoe Kravitz, Venus and Serena Williams, Lily James, and Billie Eilish. Every celebrity turned up in their best outfits, with some opting for a dress and others choosing to wear a suit. Each year, the Oscars are an opportunity for stars to turn up in their best looks, and this year did not disappoint. The outfits were varied, but many donned red and pale pink, which seemed to be the evening’s main colours. However, some wore clad in bright or clashing colours, such as British actor Daniel Kaluuya, who looked dashing in a shiny turquoise jacket. Meanwhile, Lupita Nyong’o looked dashing in a gold tinsel-like gown covered in pink sequined flowers. Love them or hate them, here are the Awards’ most interesting red carpet looks.
