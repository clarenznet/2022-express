According to Camilla Tominey, the Telegraph's royal expert, the royal brothers have not made amends and their relationship has "not recovered" from comments Prince Harry said during a landmark interview with Oprah. Harry claimed William was "trapped" within the monarchy and said: "My brother can’t leave that system, but I have.” Ms Tominey said Prince Charles is allegedly in regular contact with Prince Harry, but the same cannot be said for the siblings. Ms Tominey wrote: "As one source put it: 'As the Queen has always said, they remain much-loved members of the family but it’s not been easy. It’s hard enough for any family to get along but when such intimate details are made public on prime time TV? It’s difficult to put that genie back in the bottle.'" FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
