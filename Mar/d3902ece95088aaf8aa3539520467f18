The closures will include 24 Lloyds Bank sites, 19 Bank of Scotland locations and 17 Halifax branches. Vim Maru, group retail director of Lloyds Banking Group, said: "Just like many other high street businesses, fewer customers are choosing to visit our branches. "We need to adapt to the significant growth in customers banking online." The branches are thought to employ 124 people, but Lloyds said it would try to find affected staff new roles. Caren Evans, of the union Unite, said: "When a bank branch closes, the heart of the community is ripped out and the results are devastating. Simply leaving an ATM in place of a vibrant bank branch is wholly insufficient."
