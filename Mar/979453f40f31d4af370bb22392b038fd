The quake is understood to have occurred in waters off Japan’s northern coast. It did not result in the threat of a tsunami, according to the JMA. Japan’s Government said it was on high alert yesterday, on Thursday, following another earthquake with a higher magnitude. The first earthquake hit at around 11.36pm local time on Wednesday. It had a magnitude of 7.4 on the Richter scale. This was followed closely by a 5.6-magnitude aftershock, shortly before 1am on Thursday.
