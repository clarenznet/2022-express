The block of flats is said to be on Bucknall Old Road, in Hanley, an area north of Stoke on Trent and north-east of Newcastle under Lyme.  StokeLive reported that an air ambulance has been spotted landing at a clearing near Old Hall Street. It added that witnesses say the fire started around 7.10am this morning (Saturday). A spokesperson for Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service said: "Eight crews from across North Staffordshire attended the scene alongside officers from Staffordshire Police and paramedics. "Multiple breathing apparatus, main jets and an aerial ladder platform were used to extinguish the fire. No one was injured. "Neighbouring flats have been evacuated for the safety of residents." The fire service later added that a structural engineer from Stoke-on-Trent City Council had been called to inspect the building. Meanwhile, "an investigation into the cause is underway".  As of 9.50am, there was a huge emergency presence sighted around the block of flats. One resident commented: “I just hope everyone is okay. I’ve never seen this amount of emergency services here before.” As of 10.30am, police had reportedly arrived on the scene.
