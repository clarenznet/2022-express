Just under 20 percent of 115,000 Finns of a healthy weight were found to have had two conditions by age 75. But for obese people, the proportion was reached at 55. Similar results were seen in a group of 500,000 British adults. The researchers, from Helsinki and University College London, said: "Compared with healthy weight people, those with obesity were at a five times increased risk of simple multimorbidity and more than 12 times increased risk of complex multimorbidity." Simple multimorbidity is two or more conditions, while complex multimorbidity means four or more. But results did find the effect of obesity on mortality is not as marked, so overweight individuals live on with conditions rather than die early.
