Outlander actress Caitriona Balfe put on a jaw-dropping display tonight while attending the EE British Academy Film Awards 2022 Nominees' Reception in London. The star, 42, who plays Claire Fraser in Starz show Outlander, showcased her incredible figure in the skintight outfit as she stepped onto the red carpet at the glamorous event. Posing for snaps, Caitriona gave a barely-there grin to photographers as she flaunted her amazing figure, just seven months after giving birth to her son with her husband, Tony Gill. Donning a black, skintight jumpsuit, the Outlander star sent jaws dropping as she gave a generous view of her cleavage. The garment featured an intricate knot design just below her breasts and above her waist, cinching in her already tiny figure. The actress accessorised her outfit with a black Yves Saint Laurent clutch bag and pair of heels.

The star's appearance at the London event comes days after she and Outlander co-star Sam Heughan attended the season six premiere of the hit show. Wearing a black maxi dress, the actress put on a more demure display as she clutched an orange bag while posing for snaps with her Jamie Fraser actor co-star. However, the star was unable to attend the London premiere of the show and took to Twitter to defend her no-show as fans branded her "shameful". She explained that as a new mum who currently lives in LA, she is not readily able to fly across the world any time like she was before.
