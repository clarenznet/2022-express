The police watchdog is probing why Scotland Yard failed to investigate two men who allegedly backed up false claims by fantasist Carl Beech. A 2016 report said the Yard should bring in an outside force to probe the two for perverting the course of justice.  The Yard's failure was investigated by Merseyside Police last year but yesterday the Independent Office for Police Conduct said it would be probed further. It follows complaints from two people "adversely affected" by the two witnesses.
