  Heart Breakfast’s Amanda Holden took to Instagram today to share some hilarious updates with her 1.8 million followers. Joining her in her cheeky video was colleague Ashley Roberts, who was left in hysterics after Amanda fell on top of her while they were trying out a new gadget.     Amanda, 51, could be seen sitting straddling Ashley’s chest and laughing non-stop in her Instagram story. The pair appeared to be sitting on some sort of vibrating platform, with Amanda captioning the clip: “Getting Jiggy with Ashley Roberts”. However, the device was vibrating so much that Amanda looked panicked for a moment, before promptly falling on top of her co-star, causing Ashley to roll off the piece of tech. Seconds later, Amanda had her feet up in the air and accidentally flashed her underwear at the camera, covering her modesty with an emoji on the hilarious Instagram clip.

Amanda told Ashley: “The women who are getting older are still smashing those glass ceilings - because there’s less of a care about what we’re supposed to be perceived as doing at 40 or 50, or even 20 and 30." Ashley agreed, saying: "There was a saying that was like ‘35 and on the shelf’ and I was like: ‘what?! I think I’m just beginning!'. "I think I’m having a resurgence at 40. We get to know our bodies more, we’re more connected to ourselves."
