Paul Merson believes Arsenal are now the favourites for fourth in light of their dramatic 2-1 victory in the dying embers against Wolves last week. The former Gunners midfielder is never usually shy to criticise his old side but this time around, he believes they have what it takes to go the distance and secure the return of Champions League football. With Manchester City and Liverpool now riding off into the distance and Chelsea boasting games in hand, the top-four race has simply become a question of fourth. There are plenty of teams in the running including Arsenal, Manchester United, West Ham, Tottenham and potentially even Wolves - despite recent defeats. Arsenal were facing a major setback last time out in the Premier League when Wolves led at the Emirates Stadium before late goals from Nicolas Pepe and Alexandre Lacazette flipped the game on its head. Now Merson views Arsenal as favourites, permitting they can remain on track and maintain their recent form.

"They have nice fixtures too from now until the end of the season and no one else is mounting a serious challenge are they? "West Ham are a bit hit and miss, Tottenham are all over the place, Manchester United are a shambles, and Wolves just lost at the Emirates.
