The 22-year-old says she could not continue her studies in Germany, "drinking coffee" every morning while Vladimir Putin destroys her homeland. Maryna said it is "better to go back and die" rather than live safely in Europe while the war continues. She said pulling the trigger for the first time will be "hard" but vowed: "I am ready". She added: "I have never fired a gun before. But that's OK. They can train us." The first foreign fighters arrived in Ukraine yesterday to help defend the country said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said: "The first 16,000 are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us and for all." If Maryna is not allowed to fight on the frontline, she has vowed to make Molotov cocktails or cook for Ukrainian fighters. Liz Truss has warned Britons not to travel to Ukraine and fight the Russian forces. The Foreign Secretary said that despite it being a "just cause" it is "too dangerous" for people to travel to the warzone. Ms Truss's remarks come days after she was criticised for giving her support to vigilantes who wanted to help Ukrainians protect their country.
