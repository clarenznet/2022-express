The 48-year-old German supermodel recently turned heads at the Billboard Women in Music Awards in Los Angeles, after she appeared in a colourful Moschino ensemble that accentuated the contours of her still remarkable figure.     The mum of four’s outfit was coupled with a striking pink handbag, matching nails, black strappy heels, and heavily lashed eyes.   Klum, who appears in the latest series of both America’s Got Talent and Making the Cut, a reality show which pits designers against each other, posed for paparazzi with her third husband, the 32-year-old musician Tom Kaulitz, who accompanied her to the ceremony.   Kaulitz plays guitar in the German rock band Tokio Hotel and could himself be seen rocking a smart casual slick navy suit and black t-shirt at the Awards.   The 72-year-old American singer Bonnie Raitt was celebrated with the coveted Icon Award, while the 19-year-old sing-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo won Woman of the Year.
