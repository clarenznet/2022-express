Susan Rigg was serving a suspended sentence when she hurled abuse at two police officers and then launched her attack. The 68-year-old, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, had called the police herself and asked for their help to be "re-housed". Rigg appeared at Durham Crown Court on Thursday for sentence after pleading guilty to breach of a suspended sentence, burglary, and assaulting an emergency worker.Neil Jones, prosecuting, said the attack on the police officer happened at about 11pm when a female PC attended a South Shields address. He said: "The defendant was sitting drinking alcohol with another woman and a man. "The man wanted the defendant to leave and she [Rigg] was ringing the police to try and get re-housed."The police were trying to re-house her but they were getting drunken slurring words." The officers then took Rigg back to an address she was last listed as living at, but the locks had been changed, reports Chronicle Live. Then, as the female officer opened the back door of the police car, Rigg "became abusive".
