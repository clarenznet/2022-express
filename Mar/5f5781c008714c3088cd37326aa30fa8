Lewis Hamilton says it was “unfortunate” Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez retired from the race as he picked up a podium place in a dramatic finish. Hamilton benefited from retirements from Verstappen and Sergio Perez on the final laps. Verstappen slowed in the last sector a few laps before the end and pulled into the pits to retire the car. That paved the way for Hamilton to rescue a poor weekend with a third-place finish. The Brit said: “I think it was such a difficult race, we've struggled throughout practice. This was the best result we could have got. Of course it was unfortunate for the other two drivers but we did the best we could and we’re grateful for these points." He added he was “hoping” for some new updates to the car. But he warned: “It’s not going to be a quick turnaround.” READ MORE: Toto Wolff refuses to answer question which may concern Lewis Hamilton Perez lost control of his car on the exit of Turn One after complaining of issues just minutes earlier.
