Rihanna, who announced she is expecting her first child with boyfriend Asap Rocky last month, left very little to the imagination in her latest outfit. The singer and beauty mogul, 33, pushed the fashion boundaries as she flaunted her pregnancy curves in see-through attire. The Diamonds hitmaker recently attended Milan Fashion Week and has now headed to Paris Fashion Week wearing Dior's sheer mesh négligée. Rihanna, who also runs her Savage X Fenty lingerie line, opted for a black lace bra and thong underneath a sheer mesh dress. She accessorised the daring outfit with a leather jacket that covered her derriere. The beauty teamed her eye-popping look with a pair of shiny knee-high boots which elongated her long legs. Rihanna oozed confidence as she flashed the flesh as the singer posed for pictures. The Umbrella hitmaker sported her dark tresses in a slicked hairstyle and added dark makeup to accentuate her features. She added layers of silver chain jewellery and earrings to complete her risqué look.
