It’s Tuesday, which means another chance to become a multimillionaire is here in the form of the EuroMillions. Tonight you could become a whopping £55 million richer - and it only costs £2.50 to throw your hat into the ring. Playing EuroMillions is simple - all you need to do is choose five numbers from one to 50, and two Lucky Stars from one to 12. Alternatively, you can leave it in the hands of fate and opt for a Lucky Dip, which will pick random numbers for you. You can play from the comfort of your own home online via the National Lottery’s website or app, or you can buy your ticket at your local newsagents, petrol station, post office or supermarket.   Tickets can only be bought between 6am and 11pm online and in store, but on draw days you’ll need to purchase your ticket before 7.30pm for it to be entered in that evening’s draw. You must be over 18 to play any National Lottery game. The Thunderball draw will also be held tonight - draws are held four times a week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. For just £1 a play you could win a life-changing £500,000. Tonight’s winning numbers will be announced around 8.45pm. Check back here later this evening to see if you’ve won £55 million.
