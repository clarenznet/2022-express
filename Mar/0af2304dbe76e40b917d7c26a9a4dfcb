The Russian leader stated that the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be considered a combat activity. Russian media announced that Moscow would consider any attempts by other countries to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine as participation in hostilities. The news comes as the Russian president claimed that the entire Ukrainian military infrastructure has been destroyed. He added that Russia had eliminated Ukraine's air defences. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said Nato has given the “green light for further bombing of Ukraine” by ruling out a no-fly zone. He said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity”. Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged nuclear war in Europe.
