''It is disgraceful that a few bitchy opportunists attack the couple and aim to distort reality ("Keir: Cambridges sent 'odd' mixed messages on tour", March 29), unlike the huge number of ordinary people who greeted them enthusiastically''. 'AT LAST, some common sense, with Dominic Raab speaking out against the wokery that has gripped the nation', says Julie Forrow from Dawlish, Devon. ''He says he plans to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights ("Cancel culture's new McCarthyism is an attack on freedom", March 28). I suggest he does, as without the freedom to speak our minds we are all just lemmings''. ''PROTESTS against putting the clocks forward one hour permanently were much more widespread than some people make out (Letters, March 29)'', says Bob Bannister from Coventry. ''This experiment between 1968 and 1971 was so unpopular that MPs voted by 366 votes to 81 not to continue with it. ''Millions of adults found that they were going to work in the morning and returning in the evening in the dark. At least the existing system allows children to go to and return home from school safely and in the daylight''. ''VANESSA Feltz (March 29), claims Mother's Day can be emotionally draining for many reasons, such as remembering those mothers no longer with us'', says Christine Kershaw, from Minehead, Somerset. ''This year Mother's Day fell on my mother's birthday. She died 15 years ago but, unusually, I had calls from several family members who picked up on the date. ''It was a great comfort to me to know that they remembered her''. ''SO TV bosses fear a backlash over the screening ofWorld Cup matches ("BBC faces own goal over Strictly switch", March 28)'', says Linda Talbot from Stanley, Co Durham. ''Well why don't they screen the matches on other channels such as BBC3 and ITV4 and then everyone will be happy? I am so sick of football intruding on television schedules, it's not fair''.
