Ralf Rangnick could reap the rewards of taking a leaf from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's book when Manchester United face bitter rivals Manchester City on away turf this weekend. The Red Devils have endured a turbulent campaign to date and will face a tricky task in claiming all three points against the defending Premier League champions, who find themselves well-placed to clinch the domestic honours once again at the end of the season. United, on the other hand, are well adrift of the battle for Premier League glory and will simply be looking to hold down a place in the division's top four between now and the end of the campaign.However, there will be no shortage of motivation for Rangnick's men on Sunday when they travel to the Etihad Stadium for another crack at winning the local bragging rights.The German coach, who will manage United on an interim basis until the end of the season, is yet to face City in his new role but will be desperate to seal a much-needed victory in order to aid the club's top-four hopes.United were comfortably beaten in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford three months ago in what proved to be Solskjaer's final Manchester derby in charge of the Red Devils.However, the Norwegian boasts a strong record against City with four wins from his last eight meetings with Pep Guardiola on the touchline. JUST IN: Roman Abramovich 'in a panic' and 'wants to sell Chelsea quickly' United came away with maximum points at the end of their last trip to the Etihad Stadium, with Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw finding the back of the net to secure an impressive win on enemy territory last season.Solskjaer revealed after the full-time whistle that United won the game as a result of their four-point game plan, which saw them take a direct approach and maintain a positive outlook with the ball at feet.The 49-year-old also detailed the importance of playing at a high tempo while at the same time being ready to defend as a collective unit when out of possession."We went back to being a little bit what we wanted to be and that’s being direct," said Solskjaer when quizzed on the factors that shaped United's win over City. “We have to be positive, we’re a positive team," he added. "We want to play at a high tempo, but we have to defend well, you have to defend to attack the spaces that appear."There has to be a collective, no team in world football has a chance against them [City] without being a collective, hungry team who knows you have to defend well but also be positive on the ball."It remains to be seen whether Rangnick will be able to emulate Solskjaer's no-nonsense approach to playing against City when United lock horns with their cross-city rivals on Sunday afternoon.The Red Devils have improved somewhat under Rangnick's guidance having scored two or more goals in all but one of their past nine matches in all competitions.
