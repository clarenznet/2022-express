The Conservatives gathered in Blackpool for the two-day conference to address delegates on a number of pressing issues, including the cost of living crisis, the UK transport plan, and the Ukraine crisis. However, Mr Johnson sparked outrage by attendees - including Brexiteers when he controversially compared the war in Ukraine to Brexit.  In his speech to over 2,000 delegates, Mr Johnson said that the world faced a moment of choice between “freedom and oppression” and criticised those who believe it is necessary to “make accommodations with tyranny”. He said: “I know, it’s the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom every time. “I can give you a couple of famous recent examples. When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large numbers, I don’t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. “It’s because they wanted to be free, to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.” Do you think the two situations can be compared? Or was this a tasteless reference from Mr Johnson? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
