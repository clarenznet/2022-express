Most adult pay as you go Transport for London (TfL) fares are increasing by 10p to 30p from March 1, and paper tickets are increasing by between 30p and 80p. This might not sound like a lot, but when you compare the ticket prices over the last 10 years, the total increase is staggering. Express.co.uk reveals how London ticket prices have increased since 2012. Fares on TfL services have risen today in line with conditions on short-term funding agreements by the Government. The fares have increased in order to help TfL reach financial sustainability by April 2023 and ensure London’s economic recovery after the pandemic is green and sustainable. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “Public transport should be affordable to all, and I’ve taken bold action to ensure this since I became Mayor by introducing the unlimited Hopper bus fare and freezing all TfL fares from 2016-2021 - saving the average London household over £200. “Since TfL’s finances were decimated by the pandemic, the Government has set strict conditions as part of the emergency funding deals to keep essential transport services running in London. “We have been forced into this position by the Government and the way it continues to refuse to properly fund TfL, but I have done everything in my power to keep fares as affordable as possible.” READ MORE- 'Chaos' at UK airport as tourists waited for luggage that never came In December 2021, the Mayor announced that he was having to consider making modifications to fares structures and ticketing in order to raise between £60 and £80 million per year. These changes include: Mr Khan froze fare increases between 2016 and 2021, so this is the first time TfL fares have significantly increased in six years. The previous Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, increased TfL fares regularly and was responsible for an increase of more than 42 percent in ticket prices. A significant proportion of the increase from 2012 to today would have come into play before the 2016 caps. Since 2016, fares only increased by 13 per cent in total (including Travelcards and caps).
