 One of the most common questions refugees and asylum seekers have is how they can improve their English language skills. Learning English can be helpful for finding a job or studying, and can help prevent loneliness or isolation as you arrive in a new country. Whether you have some knowledge of the language already or you’re a total beginner, there are many services available to help you. Refugees who have been granted settled status in the UK are entitled to eight hours a week of free classes for a year. The language classes are called English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). They may also be called an ESL (English as a Second Language) course.  You should contact your local council to sign up. You can find your local council by typing your postcode in to the box. Then simply use Google to search for your local council website and ESOL courses. For example, if you lived in Lambeth in London, you Google: Lambeth free ESOL courses.

The ESOL Courses website also offers a host of classes including: If you’ve already tried some free classes, or if you want to learn English as quickly as possible, you can also choose to pay for English classes.
