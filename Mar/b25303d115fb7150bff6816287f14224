Ruth Anderton requested a one-meat thaly - a sharing meal for three - regular chips and one bottle of Coca Cola from Sangam Balti House in Lostock Hall, Lancashire, on Sunday February 20. The order was accepted but didn't arrive at Ruth's home in nearby Preston, Lancashire, until some 19 hours later. The order receipt said Ruth's food should have arrived just after 11pm on the night she placed the order, but the establishment has allegedly since told Ruth it doesn't take orders after 10pm - despite accepting hers on the night in question at 10.06pm. The diner now intends to visit the establishment to complain formally, Lancs Live reports. But she wrote on a public Facebook page: "Sangam Balti House, Lostock Hall. Take look at the time and date ordered. "When did it turn up? 6pm the day after. I was ringing to see where it was the night before but no answer. "When I rang the day after, the bloke on the phone said no more orders were taken after 10pm. But they were quick enough to take the money straight away. "Within a couple of minutes a delivery driver was knocking on my door whilst I was still on the phone. 19 hours late. I said how unimpressed I was and he said he'd refund me by sending a driver the day after with my money. Never showed. "Must have clocked my number and ignored me. Might pay them a visit when I'm next in Lostock Hall."   Sangam Balti House has an average of 4.5 stars out of 5 on TripAdvisor. It has been praised on the site for its "excellent service" and "superb food". The restaurant has been approached for comment by Lancs Live and Express.co.uk.
