Sony has lifted the lid on its big PlayStation Plus revamp, which combines its existing PS Plus service with PlayStation Now, as well as offering plenty more. The all-new PS Plus service will begin its launch in June, with three different tiers on offer - PS Plus Essential, Extra and Premium. The entry-level tier, which is priced at £6.99 per month, £19.99 per quarter or £49.99 per year is the existing PS Plus service we all know. The next level up is PS Plus Extra which provides all of the benefits of the Essential tier, plus access to a catalogue of up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games, including blockbuster exclusive titles from PlayStation Studios. This is priced at £10.99 per month, £31.99 per quarter of £83.99 per year. The top-of-the line membership is PS Plus Premium, which offers all of the benefits of the Essential and Extra tiers. But in addition to this you'll get up to 340 extra games, including PS3 games available for streaming as well as a catalogue of classic PS1, PS2 and PSP games available for streaming or downloading. This tier will also offer limited-time game trials so PlayStation gamers can try before they buy. In total this membership tier will offer access to over 700 games. Titles that will be available in the Extra and Premium tiers at launch include God of War, Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, Death Stranding and Returnal.  PS Plus Premium is priced at £13.49 per month, £39.99 per quarter of £99.99 per year. In areas where cloud streaming is not available, PS Plus Deluxe will be offered instead of PS Plus Premium. This will be available at a lower price and will offer the library of PS1, PS2 and PSP games as downloadable titles. Outlining the all-new PS Plus in a blog post, SIE President and CEO Jim Ryan said: "Since launching PlayStation Plus in 2010, SIE has been at the forefront of innovation with game subscription services. We were thrilled to be the first console membership service that included a refreshed library of games through PlayStation Plus, and also launched the first console game streaming service with PlayStation Now.  "Today, we are pleased to share with you official news about changes coming to our subscription services. This June, we’re bringing together PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now in an all-new PlayStation Plus subscription service that provides more choice to customers across three membership tiers globally. "Our focus is on providing high-quality, curated content with a diverse portfolio of games." The all-new PS Plus will be launched in a phased rollout, with several markets in Asia first getting the service followed by North America, Europe and then the rest of the world where PS Plus is offered. Sony says they "aim to have most PlayStation Network territories live with our new PlayStation Plus game subscription service by the end of the first half of 2022".
