Fern Wormald, 48, was bitten on her right calf while on safari with her daughter in Senegal five years ago. Medics in the West African country had, at one stage, believed the limb would need amputating.  Only a handful of clinics in the UK can perform the procedure and each charge in the region of Â£15,000.Fern, of Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, said: "At the moment I've got 11 ulcers on my leg and they are so very painful.

The treatment will help remove the fluid and then the sepsis will go with it.
