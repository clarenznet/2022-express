More than two years have passed since the UK officially parted ways with the European Union (EU). However, negotiations are still rumbling on to decide a number of post-Brexit related issues, including the Northern Ireland protocol. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a staunch leave campaigner during the 2016 EU referendum and has previously said leaving the bloc would bring about the revival of the UK’s “power of independent thought and action”.  Since its exit, the UK has managed to secure several lucrative free trade agreements, including the most recent which was announced with New Zealand. Mr Johnson hopes it can prove a step toward joining a trade club with the likes of Canada and Japan. So, how would you rank the PM’s showing to deliver on Brexit? What must he do next?
