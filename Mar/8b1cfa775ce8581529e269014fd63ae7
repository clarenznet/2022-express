Waffle, a three-year-old border collie, was rehomed by the RSPCA's Stubbington Ark centre last year. But just four months later he was returned as his owners could not cope with his behaviour. Waffle, who is described as a "complex soul", has now been waiting for more than nine months for another home with no luck. However, staff are certain the perfect adopters are out there for the nervous pooch. Kayleigh Allen, from the RSPCA branch, said: “Unfortunately Waffle really struggles to bond with new people and is particularly nervous around strange men. "However, once he knows you he is such a lovely lad, but it can take several meetings to get to this stage. “Waffle is a complex soul and he’s very sensitive as he’s not had the best start in life. "He lacks socialisation skills and is fearful of new people and other dogs. "He initially found the outside world incredibly overwhelming but, with lots of time, patience and work, he’s come a long way. “However, his new owners will need to be confident and willing to continue with his training, although we’re happy to support this work in the home.” READ MORE: Rescue dog still waiting to be picked after 400 days in kennels  The RSPCA is looking for experienced and understanding adopters to take on Waffle.
