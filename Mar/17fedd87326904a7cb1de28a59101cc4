Manchester United could be forced to lead a hectic summer recruitment drive in order to replace a number of their existing stars between now and the start of next season, with Marcus Rashford now said to be among those weighing up the idea of a move elsewhere in the near future. The Red Devils spent in excess of £100million on new players during pre-season and will likely be forced into splashing a similar outlay on additional reinforcements when the market re-opens at the end of the current campaign. United spent heavily to land Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho to bolster their ranks but their new arrivals have largely failed to deliver the goods thus far.Varane has been in and out of the side at Ralf Rangnick's discretion as of late, while Ronaldo has struggled to fit into the German coach's high-pressing style and has only scored one Premier League goal since the turn of the year.Meanwhile, Sancho has been one of United's better performers in recent weeks but initially endured a slow start to life at Old Trafford after joining the club from Borussia Dortmund over the summer.The England ace could end up as one of just two senior forwards on the club's books by the time next season rolls around, with a number of attack-minded players likely to seek pastures new over the coming months.The likes of Edinson Cavani, Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard will almost certainly leave United on free transfers in the summer after failing to extend their current deals at Old Trafford.

However, there are no certainties when it comes to the potential targets that could do a job for United if they are snapped up by those in command at Old Trafford in the near future.United are known to be long-term admirers of Borussia Dortmund marksman Erling Haaland but will face no shortage of competition in the race for his signature this summer.Real Madrid and Manchester City have been heavily linked with the 21-year-old's services as of late, while club officials from Barcelona reportedly met with the player's representatives earlier this month.Everton marksman Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tottenham's Harry Kane, who was denied a big-money move to Manchester City last summer, have also been mentioned in connection with the Red Devils over the last few weeks.
