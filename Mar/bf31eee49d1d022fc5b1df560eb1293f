The strength, courage and dignity they have shown as a people has been nothing short of remarkable. The United Kingdom stands with Ukraine. We have supported their armed forces and taken tough action against Putin’s fatcat oligarchs. Express readers have shown they are willing to help. We are providing support to neighbouring countries. Today, we are asking people across the country to step forward and offer a lifeline to thousands of Ukrainians who need a roof over their heads. Our Homes for Ukraine scheme will provide Ukrainians with somewhere to live in the UK. We had already opened our borders to those with family links to the UK, but our new sponsorship scheme is open to those with no ties to this country. There is no limit on the numbers we will accept and so we are asking individuals, businesses, charities, and other organisations to step forward with offers of accommodation. To begin with, if you know someone who needs to come to the UK from the Ukraine please get in touch with each other and visit www.gov.uk for more information. If you are keen to sponsor people but don’t know anyone from the Ukraine personally our charities, churches, universities, and more, have reach across Europe and we are working closely with all of them to identify and match many more people fleeing the Ukraine to people here who want to help. You can register your interest online so you can be kept up to date with the scheme. This is a call to arms for the whole country and I’m sure Express readers will be among the first in line to help. Brits have got a long, proud history of stepping up to help our allies in times of need. We took in refugees fleeing Hitler's Germany, Idi Amin's Uganda and the atrocities of the Balkan wars. It's part and parcel of our national character. We are a proud democracy. We defend our values, and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies in the face of aggression. • Lord Harrington is Minister for Refugees
