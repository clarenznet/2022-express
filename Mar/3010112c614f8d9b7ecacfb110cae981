Timothée Chalamet, 26, made quite the entrance on the Oscars 2022 red carpet as he went shirtless for the event. The star wore a sequined suit for the occasion without a shirt, leaving fans split on the choice. Timothée is at the glitzy event as his film Dune is nominated for multiple awards. He wore the tailored suit with a simple necklace as he posed for photographers. Fans were quick to take to social media to post about his statement outfit. Diane N Sevenay penned: "Timothee Chalamet forgot his shirt today. #Oscars." Danielle Knox added: "No shirt but serving! The shirtless look is working for @RealChalamet for real! #Oscars2022." Ben Deutsch wrote: "Ummmm, no shirt, no shoes, no service, Timothée Chalamet!!!" Fan VivyIsNotOkay added: "When you get dressed in a hurry and you forget one piece of the suit…still rocking it."
