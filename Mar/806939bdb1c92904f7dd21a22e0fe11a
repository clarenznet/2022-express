During the week that ended on March 4, a total of 8,763 people were admitted to the hospital, the official records show. The number of hospital admissions represents an 11.1 percent increase compared to the previous week. Of the hospitalised people, there were 268 coronavirus patients in beds with a mechanical ventilator on March 7. At the same time, the Covid cases were increased by 39.2 percent during the week ending on March 8, compared to the previous week. Between March 2 and March 8, a total of 322,917 people had a confirmed positive test result. Analysing the situation, Christina Pagel, Director of University College London’s Clinical Operational Research Unit, issued a warning saying that the levels could remain high “for a long time”. She explained that this could happen for three reasons, with the first one being the dominance of BA.2. BA.2 is a sublineage of the Omicron variant, which caused Covid cases to soar in England during the past three months. Two weeks ago, the World Health Organisation announced that BA.2 is found “inherently more transmissible” than BA.1, after seeing the initial data. Ms Pagel also noted that the scrap of regulations by the Government is likely to have contributed to the increase in cases and hospitalisations. She said that the reduction in people wearing masks, self-isolating, and testing is likely to be driving the rising numbers.
