The huge figure is the equivalent of more than £1million an hour since the appeal was launched, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) noted. It said the funds are already being used by DEC charities to provide people fleeing the war with food, water, medical assistance, protection and trauma care. Celebrities involved in highlighting the appeal include Trigger Point actor Adrian Lester, Game Of Thrones star Kit Harington, Hot Fuzz actor Simon Pegg, Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville and former Doctor Who David Tennant. Further donations will help scale up the work of the 15 DEC charities, including Save the Children and Age International. The DEC said "generous donations" have been made by the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, among others. The latest total also includes £25million in match-funding from the UK Government, the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through the UK Aid Match scheme. What is happening where you live?
