The upgrade to RAF Gibraltar's air traffic management system is part of a £1.5billion MoD investment, known as Programme Marshall. Photographer David Parody said: "The radar is at the northern top end of the Rock and narrow roads leading up do not permit loads to be carried. "A total of five large underslung crates were delivered." Locals, he said, were thrilled "by the amazing skills of the pilot". Incredible scenes show an RAF Chinook helicopter delivering a new state-of-the-art radar to the Rock of Gibraltar on Wednesday (2 Mar).

Photographer David Parody said: “Gibraltar's radar is located at the northern top end of the Rock and the narrow roads leading up to the installation do not permit loads to be carried by lorry. "Instead, the replacement radar system had to be airlifted by an RAF Chinook helicopter.  "A total of five large underslung loads were required to be delivered to a preprepared staging area from which the new radar will be installed to replace the existing equipment.” He adds that locals “were entertained by the amazing flying skills of the RAF Pilot who had flown from the UK (via Portugal) especially for this operation.”
