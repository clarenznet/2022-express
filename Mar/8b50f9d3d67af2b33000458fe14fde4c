As house prices rise but IHT thresholds remain frozen, more homeowners will get caught out. Grieving families who pay £4,000 today could soon hand over almost £50,000 to HM Revenue & Customs. In his Budget last March, Sunak froze the inheritance tax nil-rate band at £325,000 for five years. It will stay at that level until at least the 2025/26 tax year, and maybe even beyond. Sunak also froze the residence nil-rate band for people passing on a family home to their children or grandchildren, at £175,000. Sunak’s five-year IHT freeze will steadily drag more and more Britons into the tax net. Families who never dreamed they would face an inheritance tax bill will get caught out and need to start planning now. Mike Hodges, tax partner and head of the Private Wealth Practice Group at Saffery Champness, has issued an urgent warning about this “deeply unpopular and divisive tax”, saying many do not realise the danger they now face. Hodges said a family that would pay £4,000 IHT today could pay almost £50,000 within four years, and possibly more. His figures assume house prices rise by just five percent a year. They could climb at a much faster prace, given that they rocketed by 10 percent in 2021. Today, somebody with a house worth £510,000 would only pay a small amount IHT if passing on the property to children or grandchildren. The £325,000 and £175,000 nil-rate bands add up to £500,000, so they would only pay 40 percent IHT charge on £10,000, giving them a £4,000 bill. However, if house prices rise five percent, it would lift their property value to £535,500 in a year's time. At that point, they would pay IHT on £35,500 of property wealth.

That is only the start of their exposure. If property prices rose at the same pace over the subsequent three years, their property would be worth £619,908 by 2026. In that case, they would pay IHT on £119,908, so their bill will have skyrocketed to £47,963. That is money the family could have passed on to loved ones rather than HMRC. Hodges said the family’s IHT exposure will have exploded by a staggering 1,099 per cent, and will continue to climb after that. “Whilst over the period property prices have gone up by 22 percent in this example, the effect of the frozen nil rate band means their IHT has risen more than tenfold, from £4,000 to £47,963.” DON'T MISS:Take care when writing your will – five mistakes to avoid or your f... [INSIGHT]Urgent inheritance warning - you could lose lot unless you sign this [REVEAL]Fury at Sunak’s 55% ‘horror’ pensions tax - he’s robbing pensioners [ANALYSIS] In practice, their inheritance tax bill would be even higher, as the family is likely to have other wealth, such as savings and investments held outside of a pension, as well as property, jewellery, cars, shares and any life insurance payout. Hodges said everyone should work hard to reduce their exposure, and married couples have an advantage. They can combine both of their nil-rate bands to pass on up to £1 million worth of assets to direct descendants, free of IHT. Liz Ritchie, partner at Mazars, added: “With IHT tax likely to catch more and more people out, it’s important people invest their other assets tax-efficiently and consider options such as gifting.” Families do not use gifting enough, she said. "This can ensure that more of people’s assets are passed to loved ones or onto charitable causes, rather than going into the Treasury’s money pot.”
