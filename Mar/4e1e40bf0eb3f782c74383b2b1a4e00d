Stroke, one of the most feared conditions in the nation, occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. This can cause sudden visual disturbances, confusion, and slurred speech. According to one health body, four prescription medications have been linked to the condition. The health platforms Quality Care ER, states heartburn medicines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and pain medicines, are linked to stroke. The website explains: “Prescription medicines may put you at a higher risk for stroke. “While the connection is not always clear, some medications have been related to higher risks. Always discuss your prescription concerns with your doctor. “Always take medication as recommended, and for as short of a time frame as possible. Learn about natural remedies to improve our health and discuss the benefits with your doctor.” READ MORE: How to prevent a stroke: The 'risky' drinks that can cause 'abrupt death' - raises risk Early research has suggested that some antidepressants are linked to a slightly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. A 2012 study published in the journal Neurology drew the conclusion after studying more than 500,000 people. The antidepressants studied all fell under the drug class selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), which include Celexa, Lexapro, Paxil, Prozac, Vibryd, and Zoloft. While an association between the drugs and haemorrhage stroke was evident, researchers noted those who already had risk factors for bleeding stroke to be at the highest risk. In fact, the findings revealed that individuals taking SSRIs were between 40 percent to 50 percent more likely to have intracranial haemorrhages or intracerebral haemorrhages. In 2008, the authors of a BMJ report wrote: “All antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of stroke, and the risk might be higher in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics than those receiving typical antipsychotics.”
