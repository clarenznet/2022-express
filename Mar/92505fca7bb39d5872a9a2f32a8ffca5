Indian Wells kicked off last week, sitting in its usual mid-late March spot for the first time since 2019. New world No 1 Daniil Medvedev and Rafael Nadal, so far undefeated in 2022, both got off to a good start in the Californian desert but it was a different story for Andy Murray and Emma Raducanu, who both crashed out on Sunday within hours of one another. Novak Djokovic once again caused controversy as he kept his name in the draw until the last minute despite United States rules only allowing fully vaccinated travellers, and his section of the draw become imbalanced after his late withdrawal. Also at the BNP Paribas Open, 2018 champion Naomi Osaka was reduced to tears by a heckler that reminded her of the infamous boos Serena and Venus Williams received in 2001 that led to them boycotting the tournament for 14 years. The ATP's investigation into Alexander Zverev's outburst at the Mexico Open concluded last week, with many left unhappy that the world No 3 received a suspended ban. Novak Djokovic was a late withdrawal from Indian Wells last week after admitting he would likely miss the event during his appearance in Dubai. His name was automatically included in the draw and he had not pulled out during the draw ceremony, leaving him in as the second seed at the BNP Paribas Open before he eventually confirmed his withdrawal from both Indian Wells and Miami last Wednesday, tweeting: "While I was automatically listed in the @BNPPARIBASOPEN and @MiamiOpen draw I knew it would be unlikely I’d be able to travel. The CDC has confirmed that regulations won’t be changing so I won't be able to play in the US. Good luck to those playing in these great tournaments." The world No 2's comments left many wondering whether he had sought an exemption to the CDC's travel rules much like he did in Australia, as there was no announcement or indication that the United States' travel rules would be changing. His late withdrawal also meant Jaoa Sousa got in the draw as a lucky loser after playing qualifying, with many pointing out that the world No 85 wouldn't have needed to play the extra matches in qualifying had Djokovic withdrawn before the draw was made. JUST IN: Murray weighs in on heckler incident after Osaka reduced to tears  Emma Raducanu was back in action this week for the first time since retiring her Guadalajara match injured and subsequently withdrawing from the Monterrey Open. The world No 13 had admitted ahead of the BNP Paribas Open that she was told she had "no chance" of competing but managed to score a win in what many thought was her best match since the US Open against Caroline Garcia 6-1 3-6 6-1 in the second round, having benefitted from a bye. But she crashed out on Sunday, opening play on Stadium 1 and going down to the wire against Petra Martic before losing the two hour 46 minute battle from a set up as the world No 79 won 6-7(3) 6-4 7-5. Just hours later, Andy Murray suffered his own loss in the second-round to 31st seed Alexander Bublik, who he'd beaten in their previous meeting this year, as the Kazakh came through 7-6(9) 6-3. The former world No 1 had already beaten Taro Daniel 1-6 6-2 6-4 in an impressive rematch in the first round, in what was their third meeting of the year so far with Murray now 2-1 in the head-to-head for this year, and 3-1 overall.

But the first set was derailed for the 2018 champion when someone in the crowd began heckling her and shouting: "Naomi, you suck," with Osaka fighting back tears before going a break down and discussing the incident with the supervisor. Kudermetova ended up winning 6-0 6-4, and before her victory speech Osaka asked for the chance to speak with the crowd about what happened, admitting it reminded her of an infamous incident in 2001 which saw Serena, Venus and Richard Williams booed so heavily that the sisters did not compete in Indian Wells again until 2015. "To be honest, I’ve gotten heckled before, like it didn’t really bother me. But heckled here [Indian Wells], I’ve watched a video of Venus and Serena get heckled here and if you’ve never watched it, you should watch it," she said, fighting back tears. "And I don’t know why but it went into my head and it got replayed a lot. I’m trying not to cry. But I just wanted to say thank you and congratulations [to Kudermetova]. Yeah, just thank you."  Alexander Zverev was defaulted from the recent Mexico Open, where he was defending champion, for smashing the umpire's chair with his racket in frustration after a doubles loss and screaming: "You f*****g destroyed the whole f*****g match. The whole f*****g match," after disagreeing with a call in the final set tiebreak. He was quickly withdrawn from the tournament, fined and forced to give up his prize money and ranking points as well as pay his hotel costs. But the ATP opened an investigation into the incident and last week announced the world No 3 had been found guilty of a "major offence", fined an additional £19,000 ($25,000). Many expected the 24-year-old to receive a ban but this was instead given in the form of probation, with an eight-week ban to be imposed if Zverev is sanctioned for similar behaviour in the next 12 months. "It still is embarrassing for me now. Walking around the locker room, it's not a nice feeling,” Zverev said of the incident when arriving in Indian Wells. "But we all do mistakes. I'm also a human being, and I can guarantee you I will never act this way again in my life. It was definitely the worst moment of my life." The third seed received a bye to the second round where he lost to Tommy Paul in straight sets late on Sunday local time. The women's tournament in Indian Wells went ahead without the top two players in the world competing, as Ash Barty announced she would not be competing until Australia's Billie Jean King Cup tie next month. Second seed Barborda Krejcikova then withdrew from the tournament after the draw was made with an injury. And the world No 3 and highest seed in the draw, Aryna Sabalenka, failed to win her first match as she received a bye to the second round and lost to Jasmine Paolini. But on the men's side, newly-crowned world No 1 Daniil Medvedev played his first match since ascending to the top of the rankings and needed a little more than an hour to beat qualifier Tomas Machac 6-3 6-2. The 26-year-old took buckets of confidence after failing to fall in the pressure of his first match as world No 1, sayng: "The more tournaments you win, the more points you gain, the more chances you have to stay at this No. 1 spot for more weeks, more time. That’s what matters for me the most." And Rafael Nadal narrowly avoided an early exit when he found himself 2-5 down to Sebastian Korda in the final set of his opening match. The recent Australian Open champion mounted an extraordinary comeback to win the next four games in a row and ultimately take the match 6-2 1-6 7-6(3), extending his winning streak for the season to 16-0, a career-best.
