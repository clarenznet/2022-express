Lorraine was joined by journalist and broadcaster Caitlin Moran on Tuesday morning to discuss International Women's Day and the impact women have on today's society. When speaking about the way women are portrayed in today's society, especially in TV dramas and movies, Caitlin and Lorraine both ended up swearing live on TV and sparked a frenzy with viewers on social media. Caitlin commented: "I actually think we have gone backwards, I am all about celebration, and I am all about International Women's Day, it is the best time in the industry to be a woman. "We talk more about racism and LGBT stuff, but the class problem has gone backwards, it is far harder now, you have to pay for a higher education. "You can't get those contacts, social mobility is now at the point it was in Victorian times, and we have gone backwards in that aspect. "If you are born in the working class, you are more than likely to be trapped in it," she explained.

"[They're] having an affair with women 20 years his junior, which seems to be the majority of dramas. "I want to see dramas about having to earn your money this is the thing that astonishes me, most plots are about having an adventure. "They're having an affair or having a crisis, it should be about money, what we spend most of our days doing is earning our money, b***h gotta pay rent is the alpha and omega of everything!" Lorraine echoed what she said: "B***h gotta pay rent', I love that, that should be a series!" However, viewers of the show weren't impressed with Lorraine and Caitlin swearing live on-air and aired their frustrations on Twitter. @Jamespir wrote: "Are you allowed to say B**** on tv at 930am? #Lorraine." @MsMayTodde commented: "@caitlinmoran just say on @lorraine #Lorraine 'b**** gotta pay rent'.

LOVE IT, she doesn't mince her words does she!" (sic) International Women's day is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. ITV have celebrated the day by uniting 27 of its female stars in a stunning portrait alongside a heartwarming video. The female hosts have been at the forefront of ITV's coverage of huge events, from royal weddings to babies. The photograph, taken by Amy Brammall earlier this month, shows most of the ITV female daytime team together after almost two years of being apart. Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am on ITV.
