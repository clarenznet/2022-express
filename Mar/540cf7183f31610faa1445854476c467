Britons should be aware that they cannot contribute an unlimited amount towards their pension pot and still receive tax relief. There are limits in place, such as the annual allowance, which could restrict them from topping up their retirement savings. The annual allowance caps the amount someone can save into a pension in a given year. The limit is currently set at £40,000 per year. Britons are able to put away more than the £40,000 amount, but they could be hit with a tax charge as a result. Anyone who breaches the allowance must report this on their self-assessment tax return.

This is because the annual allowance has a mechanism which may allow someone to roll forward unused allowances from previous years. The 'carry forward' rules allow people to use unused allowances from up to the three prior tax years in the current tax year. This is only available to people who have already used their full current allowance and who were members of a pension scheme in the tax year they are attempting to carry forward from.

However, Britons are still limited to pension contributions of up to 100 percent of their salary in the tax year they are making the contribution, even if they have unused allowances available to carry forward. The annual allowance was once much higher, but has reduced over the years to its current level. First introduced in the 2006/07 tax year, it was set at £215,000. It was then increased the following year up to £225,000. In the 2008/09 tax year, the allowance was once again increased by £10,000 to £235,000. Two more £10,000 increases followed, taking the annual allowance to £255,000 by the 2010/11 tax year. This remains the highest level the limit has ever been at, and the allowance has only decreased since then. In the 2011/12 tax year, the annual allowance dropped significantly all the way down to £50,000. This represented a reduction of more than 80 percent. The annual allowance was held at £50,000 until the 2014/15 tax year, when it dropped once again to £40,000. No further change has been made to the limit since 2014.
