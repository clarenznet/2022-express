Dubbed the Waitrose Effect, being close to a branch of this store has been a barometer for rising house prices for some time. Yet research by CIA Landlords has revealed that Waitrose is no longer the top dog when it comes to high house prices near supermarkets. Sainsbury's has been named the store which will add the most value to homes, with an average increase of £39,572.82. This is followed by properties close to Marks & Spencer, with £16,415, then Waitrose at £6,847. And living near a Lidl adds more value to the average home (£1,774.06) than Tesco, Morrisons or Asda (£756.85, £808.49 and £932.50, respectively). A Co-op is less valuable, offering just £388.42. Richard Wayman, of CIA Landlords, believes Sainsbury's took the top spot because of increasing supermarket shortages and rising living prices, making more affordable supermarkets "preferable". Jonathan Rolande, of The National Association of Property Buyers, said: "The 'Waitrose Effect refers not just to the effect of the supermarkets, but also to the gentrification of areas."
