The leaders are due to visit Downing Street on Monday to present a united front against President Putin. The Prime Ministers of Canada and the Netherlands are due to visit London this week and join Mr Johnson on a visit to an RAF base to meet members of the UK armed forces.  During the week the leaders will engage in separate bilateral meetings and a joint trilateral meeting in which the PM is expected to push for sustained support of Ukraine. The three leaders will then host a joint press conference in Downing Street. The Prime Minister is expected to get his counterparts to back his six-point plan on tackling Russian President Vladimir Putin and will push other leaders to increase aid to Ukraine. Mr Johnson tweeted: “We must come together under a six-point plan of action to ensure Putin fails in his ambitions.  “The world is watching. It is not future historians but the people of Ukraine who will be our judge.” The six-point plan states that the “international community must come together” and it lists the following points: “Mobilise international humanitarian coalition for Ukraine, support Ukraine in its efforts to provide for its own self-defence, maximise the economic pressure on Putin’s regime, prevent the normalisation of Putin’s regime, pursue diplomatic paths to de-escalation on basis of full participation by the legitimate government of Ukraine, begin a rapid campaign to strengthen security and resilience across the Euro-Atlantic area.” The UK Government is due to send an extra £74 million to Ukraine to aid the people fleeing from their home after Russia launched its onslaught 12 days ago.

Boris Johnson said: “In the time since Russia’s illegal and brutal assault, we have seen the world stand up tall in solidarity with the indomitable people of Ukraine. “UK aid is already reaching those who need it most, delivering essential supplies and medical support. “While only Putin can finally end the suffering in Ukraine, today’s new funding will continue to help those facing the deteriorating humanitarian situation.” DON'T MISS:Adonis looks to spark bitter war of words with Frost (INSIGHT)Craig Revel Horwood speaks on 'falling in love' with Strictly co-star (REVEAL)Prince Harry ‘would be a distraction’ at Prince Philip memorial – POLL (POLL)  To target Russian oligarchs, MPs are due to vote on the Economic Crime Bill which is emergency legislation that will create a register of overseas ownership of UK property and change the system of “unexplained wealth orders”. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss commented on the array of economic sanctions they have managed to put in place. She said: “Our message to Putin and his cronies has been clear from day one - invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling consequences. We have been true to our word, introducing the largest and strongest sanctions package in our history, but we are not stopping here. “The changes we are making will allow us to go faster and harder on those closest to Putin, including oligarchs, as we continue to ratchet pressure in the face of illegal and unprovoked Russian aggression.”
