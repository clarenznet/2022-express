   Alex, 37, put on a glamorous display as she arrived at the red carpet outside The Londoner Hotel on Monday. The star looked gorgeous in the black maxi gown, which featured a split up all the way up to the thigh on one side. Alex paired the garment with charcoal heels and some black nail varnish on her toes to match. The sports commentator opted for a polished make-up look, complete with false eyelashes, winged eyeliner and some shiny lip gloss.  Alex accessorised the outfit with large silver hoop earrings, a heavy silver necklace, and a number of rings. She carried her essentials around in a black leather handbag decorated with sparkling silver studs. The Football Focus presenter wore her long hair in relaxed beach waves, which she tucked behind both ears. The star has most recently landed herself a new presenting role on BBC daytime quiz The Tournament.
