The black and white portrait, shot by Bailey for the National Portrait Gallery in 1988, presents a stark and severe image of Diana, who was normally seen warm and smiling. By the late-1980s her marriage was collapsing and her growing unhappiness becoming clear. She wanted to establish a new identity for herself and chose Bailey's bold minimalism for the NPG project Other images from the shoot were selected by the gallery and this harsh, remote picture of Diana stayed in Bailey's archives until now. It harks back to an era of more formal unsmiling royal portraits chronicled in the Historic Royal Palaces event, which opens tomorrow and runs until October 30.   Life Through A Royal Lens looks at how the monarchy has used photos to project its image from Queen Victoria to the modern day. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge limit pictures of children Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, three, to snaps taken by Kate. Curator Claudia Acott Williams said: "Perhaps we get a more privileged, intimate view."
