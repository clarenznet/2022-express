Former MP Nick Bowles tweeted: “What do my Brexiteer friends and former colleagues think of the fact that the EU has proven itself to be far more muscular and effective than the UK Government led by Boris Johnson? “Across the board: delivering weapons, increasing defence budgets and enforcing sanctions.” The comment was picked up by ex-BBC broadcaster Andrew Neil who hit back, accusing the former politician of spouting “irrelevant nonsense”.  Mr Neil said: “Brexit might or might not have been right but it has nothing to do with any of this. “UK delivering weapons before EU, increased defence spending before its European allies and calling for strongest sanctions when EU was reluctant. Important we stick together.” So, has the UK done enough so far to help Ukraine or has it been bettered by actions taken by the EU?
