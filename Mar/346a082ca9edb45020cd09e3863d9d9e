Speaking to the House of Commons, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak unveiled his plans to battle the soaring cost of living in his Spring Statement. The Government has been facing increasing pressure to help combat soaring household prices, with prices rising 6.2 percent in the 12 months to February – the fastest for 30 years. The Chancellor announced plans to cut fuel duty, raise the National Insurance threshold, and increase the Household Support Fund. He also announced the scrapping of VAT on energy-efficient materials to aid households in reducing their energy bills. The Chancellor closed his Budget by dropping in an unexpected pledge to cut the basic rate of income tax by the next general election in 2024, saying he “stands by” people hit by soaring prices. But not everyone met the mini-budget with praise. Labour said Mr Sunak had failed to recognise the impact of the cost of living crisis on families.

She said: “In eight days, people's energy bills will be rising by 54 percent, two weeks today the Chancellor's tax hike will start hitting working people and their employers. "His National Insurance tax rise was a bad idea last September and he's admitted it's an even worse one today." Others accused the Chancellor of neglecting the most vulnerable in society, particularly those on benefits and pensioners, who went unmentioned in the Spring Statement. So what do YOU think?
