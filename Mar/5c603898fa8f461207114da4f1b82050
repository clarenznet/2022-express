All consumer bills include a standing charge, which is a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies. Standing charges could rise by more than £71 a year on average in April. Customers in South Scotland, Merseyside, North Wales and the South West of England will see the daily payments double from April. Those in London and the East of England will see increases of less than 60 per cent. Liverpudlian Jeehan Saleh and Hesham Hussain "weren't shocked" when they found out standing charges for their home in Garston would rise by double that of other areas. Jeehan said: "It's always us being hit the hardest. "There's people in poorer areas where we work who are choosing between food bills and energy bills. “Thankfully we're not in that position but it's not too far from home. You're already feeling it in so many areas, this is just another hit." Regulator Ofgem caps the charge for consumers on standard default tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, although the cap varies by region because of different costs to supply homes with power in rural or more remote areas. Ofgem assured consumers the extra costs for failed energy companies are being spread equally across the country. Nearly 30 firms went bust in the last few months because of soaring wholesale prices for gas.
