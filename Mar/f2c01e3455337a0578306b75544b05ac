Marina Ovsyannikova has called on her fellow countrymen and women to shun state media coverage. In an interview with the BBC, Marina said: "I understand it's very hard - to find alternative information - but you need to try to look for it." The editor at state-controlled Channel One was questioned after Monday's protest when she brandished a sign during a news broadcast that said: "No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you." She could be heard shouting "no war, stop the war".
