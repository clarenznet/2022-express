Sir Alan Duncan, deputy at the Foreign Office under Boris Johnson, warned the sanctions on Russia could cause gas prices to rise even more. He also argued that sanctions designed to hurt Russia economically could have a negative impact at home.  He said: “There is this auction of indignation, which all of us totally understand, against anything to do with Russia. “So, they ban this, ban that and ban everything, but in the end, we’re going to end up banning our own supplies. “We, of course, want to disadvantage Russia as an essential tool of war. “But we don’t want to disadvantage ourselves so that we fall into some kind of dystopian economic collapse.  “We are on the edge of that.” Sir Alan suggested that the UK could buy gas from subsidiaries of Russian energy giant Gazprom, which have yet to be sanctioned. He said: “Now, for instance, there are subsidiary companies of Gazprom. “Which are not sanctioned, which are not incorporated in Russia, which are incorporated in one case in the UK, which are essential to the smooth flowing of gas.” READ MORE:Disabled girl lured to park by teenager and stabbed '100 times'    Only 3 percent of the UK’s gas comes from Russia with the majority coming from Norway, the USA and Qatar. However, 40 percent of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, meaning that any disruption to supply will increase the price of gas and oil. There are also concerns that Vladimir Putin could put up the cost of oil and gas or interfere with supplies. Europe is trying to end its dependency on Russian gas, something that was demonstrated through the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline last month.
