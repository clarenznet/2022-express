Carol Vorderman, 61, looked every inch the doting mum in a new series of pictures shared last night in view of her 216,000 Instagram followers. The former Countdown star went on a hike on Sunday with her “fitness freak” daughter Katie King, who looks just like her. The pair also enjoyed a lavish dinner as they marked Mother’s Day together in what Carol described as “happy days” following Katie's move to her mum's native Wales. The mother-daughter duo appeared in good spirits as they smiled for the camera in snaps documenting their fun-filled day. Carol captioned the post: “So it was Mother's Day on Sunday and can I say I'm absolutely LOVING doing loads with my girl Dr Katie King Ph.D (I'm allowed a proud Mum moment...ha) now she's living in Wales. “She's a fitness freak and loves a hike and a gym sesh. And a party and well LIFE really.” The TV personality concluded: “Happy days. BOOOMMMMMM #motheranddaughter”
