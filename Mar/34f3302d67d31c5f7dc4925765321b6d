The renaming of the Â£12.50 platter - made up of Devon blue cheese, Quicke's mature cheddar, Coca-Cola ham, salad, pickled onions, jail ale chutney and sourdough - has provoked a furious reaction online. The pub said it was "just a bit of fun", but it went on to admit that the name change was also to acknowledge all the women who work on the local farms. Yet one Twitter user posted: "I am either going to order ploughman's or I'm walking. I won't play anymore." Another said: "I'd have said to the manager, 'Can I have a ploughman's'. Then I would have said, 'Could you please repeat my order just to make sure you understood me'. "If the manager replied, 'You'd like a ploughperson's', I'd have said, 'No, let's start again'." A third user reverted to the vernacular in writing: "I think I have nearly heard all of the PC b******* now." Dicky Harrison, landlord of The Tors Inn, in Belstone on Dartmoor, Devon, said: "It seems our ploughperson's menu choice has caused quite a Twitter storm. "We put it on the menu two years ago and it was something to catch the eye. We are a Dartmoor free house and, more importantly, we sell local products. "It was meant to be 'tongue in cheek' and we didn't expect such a reaction. But we do also live in an active farming community and we renamed the plate in a nod to the amazing ladies who work the land here. In reality, women plough, too. "We're not trying to make a statement. It is a traditional meal with a different name. "But we do boil the ham in Coca-Cola and then roast it with molasses and English mustard while serving some of the best cheese from Devon. "We do make great food and serve a good pint in a proper pub."
