Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced as part of his Spring Statement on Wednesday that VAT on the installation of energy-saving materials in residential properties would be cut from five percent to zero percent for the next five years. Mr Rees Mogg, who is the newly appointed minister for Brexit opportunities, said of the cut: "The EU would not allow us to do this, another benefit of Brexit." Irish Taoiseach Michael Martin expressed earlier in March that he is unable to bring energy prices down as much as he would like to because of the EU's energy directive. Replying to Mr Rees Mogg's comment, Twitter user Jake described the fact that EU red tape would have affected energy price cuts in the UK as an "uncomfortable truth for many".
