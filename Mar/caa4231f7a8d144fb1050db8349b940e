Dr Lee, also a part-time GP, was the first to resign from the cabinet in 2018 over the Government’s handling of the Brexit process. He later defected to the Liberal Democrats, and contested John Redwood’s seat in 2019, where he raised the party’s vote. Outside of office, the former MP for Bracknell has voiced strong opinions about the way Brexit has shaped up under the Government. Dr Lee is a rejoiner, stating earlier this month that “Britain should rejoin the EU, and fast. In future, the top table of global affairs will have three attendees: US, EU and China.” He believes Brexit has “elevated fools to public office” and claimed the British people “were done over by a posh, unpatriotic clique”.  During the 2019 election campaign, the former justice minister told Wokingham Today he believed any trading terms, including those stipulated by the World Trade Organisation, “involved the transfer of sovereignty”.
