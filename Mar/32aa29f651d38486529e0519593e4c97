People on low incomes are finding it increasingly difficult to reckon with inflation and energy bills continue to soar putting a huge strain on the household budget. However, Britons who are eligible for state benefits like Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance and Pension Credit could claim 30 additional freebies that could save them thousands of pounds. During the coronavirus pandemic the number of Universal Credit claimants almost doubled to 5.8million Britons. More than a third of these claimants are in work but claiming this benefit from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) because they are on a low income.  New claimants might not be aware that Universal Credit acts as a gateway benefit meaning they could potentially benefit from 30 additional ways to save money. This includes free prescriptions, a Cold Weather Payment and reduced Council Tax for people who are not working or on a low income.
