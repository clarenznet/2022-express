In it, a company executive said: “The business cannot continue to operate like this.” He was referring to reports P&O had lost around £100million year-on-year. The executive went on to say: “These circumstances have resulted in a very difficult, but necessary decision to restructure P&O Ferries workforce and operations in order to protect the future of the business. He went on to announce seafaring staff are to be replaced by cheaper workers from elsewhere. Employment was terminated for the what has been described as the “betrayed” workforce with “immediate effect on the grounds of redundancy”. P&O is understood to employ more than 20,000 people across the world. But it is so far understood that no French staff have been fired. Following the announcement earlier today, Mark Dickinson, General Secretray of maritime union Nautilus International, described the firings as a “betrayal”. He said: “The news that P&O Ferries is sacking the crew across its entire UK fleet is a betrayal of British workers. It is nothing short of scandalous given that this Dubai-owned company received millions of pounds of British taxpayer's money during the pandemic. “Be assured the full resources of Nautilus International stand ready to act in defence of our members. “We believe it is in our members' best interests to stay onboard until further notice.” Some have done just this and are refusing to leave their ships in protest. RMT reports that private security officers have been sent onto on ship docked at a harbour in Northern Ireland to remove staff on board. P&O has been approached for comment.
