The Government has announced that Ukrainians fleeing war will be granted free access to NHS healthcare in Britain. This means you can access GP and nurse appointments, hospital services, urgent care centres and injury units at no charge. In Britain, people need to register with a local GP surgery in order to book appointments with a doctor or nurse. So you can find your local GP service via the NHS website here.  If a doctor issues a prescription, this normally comes at a cost of Â£9.35 per item. But as a Ukrainian refugee in Britain, you may be eligible for financial help with prescription costs. The British Red Cross explains: "If you are on a low income you may be eligible to apply to the NHS low-income scheme for help with health costs such as prescriptions, dental care and eyesight tests." You can speak to a GP practice about help with prescription costs, or you can apply online here. To find your local pharmacy in Britain to pick up your prescription, you can use the NHS website here.
