The desperate inhabitants of the tiny Colombian island have taken to the sea to hunt the violent shark.  It is illegal to hunt tiger sharks as they are an endangered species. But some islanders say they are willing to suffer the legal consequences, which include fines of up to $916,500 and between 48 and 108 months in prison. Animal welfare groups have reported that despite the ban on hunting, many locals have been caught in the act of attempting to kill the shark. One prominent animal welfare group denounced a video taken from the sea which shows a navy ship approaching a group of local hunters.

The shocking incident is the first recorded shark attack on the Caribbean island – typically known for its idyllic beaches and beautiful vistas.
