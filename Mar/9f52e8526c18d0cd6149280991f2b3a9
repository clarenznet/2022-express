He said in an Instagram post: "When Adele and I started our journey together, it was never about getting super skinny. "It was about getting her healthy. Especially post pregnancy and post surgery." He continued: "When 25 dropped and the tour announced, we had to get ready for a 13 month gruelling schedule. "In that time, she warmed to training and made better food choices. As a result, she lost considerable weight and people took notice." Adele's drastic change in appearance also led her to clarify the reasons behind it. In 2019, the singer went through a lot of emotional upheaval, what with her divorce from Konecki and recovering from vocal cord surgery two years prior.  While many people "had to face a lot of their demons" during the national coronavirus lockdowns, Adele said she "did that the year before". "It became my time. I realised that when I was working out, I didn’t have any anxiety," she explained to Vogue. "It was never about losing weight," she shrugged: "I thought, If I can make my body physically strong, and I can feel that and see that, then maybe one day I can make my emotions and my mind physically strong."
