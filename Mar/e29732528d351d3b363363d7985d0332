Prince Harry is to miss the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service and he will not return home to join his family at the occasion in Westminster Abbey, it has been confirmed. Royal biographer Angela Levin hit out at Harry's decision and for acting like a “child." The Daily Mail reported she said: "It’s all about ‘me, me, me’ rather than going out of his way for his grandmother and showing her he cares. He’s behaving like a child stamping his feet." Ms Levin, who has met and interviewed the Duke of Sussex, thinks Harry has "got this all wrong." She cited security concerns and said he will get police protection if he comes, despite his concerns. Ms Levin continued: "What they won’t do, is if he goes out with his friends he gets security. He’ll probably use this same excuse to try to get out of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations.” The Daily Mail reported his lawyers claimed he "does not feel safe coming from across the Atlantic."
