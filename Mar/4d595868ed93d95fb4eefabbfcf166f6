The 62-year-old from Leeds said: "My current circumstances enable me to work up to one or two days per week." "I had originally planned to work flexibly for five years, but my plan is to let my working in retirement plan be dictated by working for as long as I continue to enjoy it. The pandemic has certainly made flexi-retirement easier for those not willing to give up work yet." "The increase in working from home and virtual communication has opened up more opportunities for me and many others to work part-time." "The money I am earning now allows me to travel more, treat myself to new things and keep up my hobbies, as well as continue to save for a future when I am fully retired. It's been a really fulfilling path so far and has helped make the transition to retirement much easier. I would certainly follow the same path if I had my time again." "I factored into my retirement from the beginning that I might have options to work as a consultant even once I retired. "In the future, I hope to spend more time at my holiday home in Scotland with my wife and two children and their families, to continue cycling and conquering the Munro mountains."
