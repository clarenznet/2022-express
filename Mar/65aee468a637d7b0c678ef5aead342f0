The newÂ Fortnite season has been given a March 20 release date by Epic Games. After a week without any hints or teasers, Epic finally made it official via a Twitter post on Saturday afternoon. While a new season is always an exciting time for Fortnite fans, the downside is that the game will be taken offline for an extended period of server maintenance. Read on to find out when Fortnite will be taken offline, and how long server maintenance is scheduled to last. According to Epic Games on Twitter, the Fortnite servers will be taken offline for Chapter 3, Season 2 maintenance at 7am GMT UK time. Matchmaking will actually be disabled slightly earlier, with fans unable to join a new game from 6.30am. At 7am GMT, nobody will be able to play Fortnite at all, and anybody already in a game will be kicked out until maintenance ends. "Downtime for Chapter 3 Season 2 will start at 3:00 AM ET (07:00 UTC) with matchmaking being disabled 30 minutes prior," reads an Epic tweet. While there's no official end time for the server maintenance, downtime typically lasts for around two hours. There's a chance it will last slightly longer for the new season, but you should be able to jump back in and start playing at around 9am. Express Online will keep this post updated with all the latest downtime developments on March 20. In terms of what fans can expect from the new season, the Battle Pass will reportedly contain a Dr Strange skin. Other rumours suggest that the season could revolve around the battle between The Seven and the IO. It's possible that we'll get Battle Pass skins for each faction, as well as a secret skin to be released later in the season. Fortnite insider Hypex believes Tanks, a Tactical Sprint ability, Cattus Cave, a Clamber Mechanic and Tactical Overshield are all in development, and could debut during the new season. That's on top of vehicle mods, letting players add weapons to their cars and trucks.
