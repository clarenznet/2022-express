Sandra Bullock, 57, donned an eye-catching pink ombré gown with a plunging neckline which the age-defying beauty threatened to spill out of. The Virginia-born star attended the premiere of The Lost City premiere at Regency Village Theatre in LA's Westwood neighborhood on Monday, just days after the on-screen star said she would take a break from acting. The voluminous dress was hard to miss as she put on an eye-popping display in the very risqué ensemble. The beauty showcased her age-defying beauty as she hit the green carpet in a sensational gown, which she paired with black leather thigh-high boots and a matching bolo blazer. The dress featured a bejeweled-embellished bodice and a train of flowery gathered tulle. Sandra flashed her cleavage in the plunging ensemble as the beauty posed for pictures. The actress sported her signature middle-parted brunette mane for the film festivities. The mum-of-two kept her makeup bold with a brown smokey eye, peach blush which accentuated her cheekbones and a nude pink lip. The Lost City actress recently shared that this would be her last film for a while as she spends more time at home with her children. Joining The Unforgivable producer-star on the green carpet was her younger sister Gesine Bullock-Prado wearing a black caped pencil dress.
