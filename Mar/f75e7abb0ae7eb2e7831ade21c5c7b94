From Tuesday, passport holding Ukrainians fleeing the war can go through a streamlined process in which they do not need to go to a visa application centre and supply biometrics before coming to the UK - but other security checks will still apply. Under previous rules, those fleeing the conflict can come from Ukraine only if they have family in the country or a willing sponsor. So far, some 1,000 visas have been approved for those fleeing Russia’s invasion. The Government previously resisted pressure to scrap all visa rules for those seeking refuge, citing security concerns. Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel were condemned by charities, opposition parties and France after they insisted that refugees first acquire a visa - a move that had left some desperate Ukrainians stuck in the French city of Calais, unable to enter Britain. Poland alone has taken in 1.3 million refugees so far, with other neighbouring countries like Moldova and Romania taking in hundreds of thousands between them. So, do you think the UK should be more benevolent towards Ukrainians fleeing Vladimir Putin’s war? Should Britain go further in helping Ukrainians?
