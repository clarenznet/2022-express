Strokes are a medical emergency whereby the supply of blood to the brain is restricted or stopped. It requires a swift response to minimise the damage inflicted on the body. Your diet holds more weight when it comes to your risk than many may think with three foods highly recommended to reduce or better yet avoid. Eating higher total amounts of red meat, processed red meat and non-dairy animal fat increased the risk of stroke, while consuming more vegetable fat or polyunsaturated fat lowered it. This is according to a study presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2021. "The findings indicate the type of fat and different food sources of fat are more important than the total amount of dietary fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease including stroke," said Fenglei Wang, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the department of nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. The studies main findings included: The main ingredient within baked goods is usually white flour, which can spike blood sugar levels. Not only that, once you crash from the sugar high, you may find yourself craving more food As such, regularly eating baked goods could lead you to consume more calories overall. If you do put on weight, the body has to work harder to keep working at an optimal level. Obesity is also another well-known risk factor for a stroke, as confirmed by the NHS. Another treat you might want to cut back on is flavoured yoghurts. Full of added sugar, it could lead to weight gain, high blood pressure, inflammation, and heart disease. Most flavoured yogurts are not healthy options. They often contain too much added sugar or other additives that should not be included in a healthy diet. The natural sugar in milk and yogurt isn't bad for you, but fruit-flavoured yogurts can be full of added sugar. Added sugars can contribute to weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, cancer and stroke.
