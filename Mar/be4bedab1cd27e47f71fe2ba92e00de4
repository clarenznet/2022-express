Channel 4's Giles Wood took to Instagram to share three pictures of the happy couple from 1986. The pair looked unrecognisable in the black and white throwback snaps. In the second picture, his wife Mary Killen, who was a model in her younger years, can be seen gazing into her husband's eyes, as well as in the third. Giles captioned the pictures in view of his 12,100 followers: "Throwback shots, Giles and Mary, circa 1986." Many social media users took to the post's comments to compliment the couple, whilst making a few celebrity comparisons. Tasha_roo said: "Mary is the perfect 50/50 of Kate Bush and Stevie Nicks." Gem_mp_ added: "Hugh Grant crossed with Tom Cruise." Tweet0r commented: "I'm seeing Hugh Grant and Kate Bush. Cracking couple."
