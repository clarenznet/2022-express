Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries joined ministers from 36 other countries including the US, France, Germany and Australia to sign a declaration imposing the ban. It followed a virtual summit convened by the Culture Secretary and Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston last week. Vladimir Putin's toxic ally Belarus will also be stopped from competing. The ministers' declaration attacked "Russia's unprovoked and unjustifiable war of choice against Ukraine". It added: "Respect for human rights and peaceful relations between nations form the foundation of international sport." Premier League games will not be shown on Russian TV after the governing body suspended its agreement with the local broadcast partner Rambler (Okko Sport).
