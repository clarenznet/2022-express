Emmerdale’s Mandy Dingle (played by Lisa Riley) has been a staple on the ITV soap since 1995, and the actress has featured in a few major storylines ever since. The Dingle favourite, who is the daughter of Caleb and Vera-Lynn Dingle, could soon be getting a blast from the past when her mother makes her debut in the programme. Mandy could also soon reunite with her ex-husband Paddy (Dominic Brunt) in a very unlikely twist. The actress who plays Mandy spoke with the Loose Women panel on Monday about her upcoming storylines. Lisa went on to tease her character could see some romance in the soap very soon. Speaking about scenes which will air this week, Lisa said: “This week, we’ve got Charity (Emma Atkins) and Chas (Lucy Pargeter) going face to face as we have The Woolpack re-opening. “The Dingle girls are going to fight as well and within this, this is going to get Mandy back to the forefront of the family.” READ MORE: Antiques Roadshow guest refuses offers for globe inside a walnut shell “There is going to be someone very important involved who people love seeing Mandy with and that’s Paddy,” the actress teased. “You’re going to see a lot of growth this week,” Lisa added before Coleen replied: “I love Mandy and Paddy.” Linda Robson went on to ask Lisa to remember some of her favourite moments on Emmerdale. “You’ve just hit the nail there with Mandy and Paddy,” she admitted. “We were so lucky, Linda.” “We were asked to do the first-ever two-hander episode which was my original exit when Paddy found out Mandy had an affair with her father’s male nurse,” Lisa recalled. “The producers trusted us to do a two-hander episode and it was unbelievable.” Lisa’s character Mandy wed her own cousin Butch Dingle (Paul Loughran) in 1998 before going on to marry Paddy. However, she left the soap two years after her marriage to Paddy ended, before making her return 20 years later.

She pointed out Lisa was a huge fan of Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes and that she would love to work with her one day.   Lisa explained: “Any interview she does I watch back about four or five times on YouTube.   “I just love how terrifically bonkers she is and with that in mind, I was like you see Mandy’s father who was a Dingle.            “But Vera Dingle who is Mandy’s mum has never ever been seen and my ultimate was for Miriam Margolyes to play Vera Dingle.   “Even if it was for four episodes. I am sure she would be busy to film for just a week, but can you imagine us both together?   “Visually, both together in leopard print, me and Miriam Margolyes it would be comedy gold.”   “It needs to happen, Lisa,” Ruth Langsford chipped in.   Emmerdale airs weekdays at 7.30pm on ITV.
