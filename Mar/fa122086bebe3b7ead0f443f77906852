Tom can be seen extending his fingers in his signature spider manner, whilst someone off-screen throws a large boot at him in an attempt to recreate Spider-Man's famous web-slinging. The audition tape is filled with featurette footage of Tom candidly describing how nerve-wracking the process of the audition was. "The audition process - it still blows my mind how crazy that whole thing was," said Tom.

Tom added: "I look back on it and it was definitely the most stressful time of my life. "I didn't know whether my life was about to change and I wanted to play this character that I'd grown up loving and admiring."
