Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said some Russian forces had been decimated, their morale was low, and the Kremlin had lost more troops in a week than the UK did in 20 years in Afghanistan. But while he played down Putin's nuclear threats, he warned Russia could well descend into indiscriminate killing - as in Syria and Chechnya where it "turned up the violence". He added: "The sense that because your invasion isn't going very well, you just become more and more reckless in applying violence is totally unacceptable."
