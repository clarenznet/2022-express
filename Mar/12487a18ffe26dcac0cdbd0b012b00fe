Among the people named in the lawsuit is Christopher Steele, a former British spy who assembled a dossier of alleged links between Trump and Moscow. The 108-page complaint reads: "In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation's democracy. "Acting in concert, the defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty." Trump, who beat Clinton in the election, alleges racketeering, the theft of trade secrets and "conspiracy to commit injurious falsehood", among other crimes. A Senate committee report in 2020 concluded that Russia used Republican political operative Paul Manafort and the WikiLeaks website to try to help Trump enter the White House.
