F1 is bracing for big changes as the 2022 season commences this weekend. The new regulations will mean very different cars, and could result in a shake-up of the order. Lewis Hamilton is worried that his team's dominance could be about to end, as the Briton warns Mercedes might not be competing for wins next season. He said: "I'm sure everyone can figure that out ‒ we are not the quickest at the moment. "Ferrari look to be the quickest, then perhaps Red Bull, and then maybe us or maybe McLaren, I don't know. But we're currently not at the top." Some drivers are heading into 2022 needing to prove themselves, including Yuki Tsunoda. Netflix's 'Drive to Survive' series followed the young Japanese driver's debut season in the sport, highlighting the ups and downs he faced. Tsunoda struggled for much of his first season with AlphaTauri, leading to some heated moments. At Imola, for example, Tsunoda could be heard saying "f***, sorry" after crashing out of qualifying. Before this, he was heard raging as other cars got in his way before a hotlap. Tsunoda said: "This f****** traffic, I can't do anything." Later, as Red Bull's Sergio Perez passed him, Tsunoda shouted: "F****** Perez! He f****** doesn't even look. F*** off. He's a f****** c***." Will Buxton, an F1 journalist, discussed why it is that Tsunoda gets so angry in the car. He said: " I don't think his team radio messages are meant aggressively. "This is a kid who has grown up in the world of motor racing and has learned his English around engineers and mechanics." Tsunoda himself also told the documentary: "I get really heated when I'm in the car. Sometimes too much."

At the Mexican Grand Prix, Perez wasn't pleased with Tsunoda's actions during qualifying. The Mexican and teammate Max Verstappen encountered Tsunoda at Turn 11 during their final flying laps. Tsunoda seemingly went off track to let them through, however, the manoeuvre distracted Perez, who skidded off track, while Verstappen slowed in response. Perez told the press after the qualifying session: "You know, it's Q3, he shouldn't be there, but it is what it is. "I think I could have been further up ahead if I didn't have Yuki in my way, and if things went smoothly." He added: "I think we underperformed today. The car wasn't the same as in FP3, and I think we took a step back. It's a bit of a shame, but I think there is a long race ahead of us, and anything can happen.

I was on a good lap, and he probably cost me too much [time]. "I just feel that Mercedes were very strong today in Q3, and we underperformed a bit." While Tsunoda struggled for much of the season, he managed to secure a fourth place finish in the last grand prix in Abu Dhabi. After the race, he said: "I’m so happy, what an incredible result to end the season with. "I think overall this weekend the car has been really strong, I didn’t expect the race pace to be quite as good but in the end it has been a great day. "It’s amazing to be finishing the season on such a high. "It’s been a long journey getting back to this point. But I’ve really rebuilt my confidence and it’s great heading into the off-season with this incredible result."
