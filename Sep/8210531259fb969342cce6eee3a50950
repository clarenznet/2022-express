All seven seasons of the classic comedy starring the late actor Warren Mitchell as the racist, sexist buffoon are airing on a nostalgia channel. The series, which originally ran on the BBC from 1966 to 1975, once attracted 20 million viewers and was once described by Prince Philip as the Queen’s “favourite show”. Fans will celebrate the recovery of instalments that went missing from the archives when they are screened for the first time since the late 1960s on Freeview channel That’s TV. But it is set to spark controversy. The caricature character of Alf has split opinion between those who salute creator Johnny Speight’s arch satire and others who believe it ­celebrates bigotry. Mitchell, who won a best actor BAFTA for the role in 1967, described his alter-ego as an “ignorant, loud-mouthed, stupid pig of a man – a know-all – nasty, repulsive”. In 1972, he performed as the opinionated West Ham fan for the Queen at the Royal Variety Performance. Afterwards, Prince Philip introduced Speight to Princess Anne, saying: “This is the gentleman who writes your mother’s favourite show.”
