Commander Julian Bennett is also accused of LSD and magic mushroom use. The veteran officer, nicknamed “sacker” for being tough at other disciplinary hearings, could be booted out and lose pension.  He is also accused of failing to give a drug sample amid suspicions of cannabis use in 2020 and of lying about why he failed to provide one. The officer claimed he had taken medical cannabidiol to treat facial palsy, which an earlier hearing was told he “knew to be untrue”. His lawyer John Beggs QC at the tribunal in West Brompton, south-west London, accused the force of seeking to obtain an unfair advantage to get a conviction. Cdr Bennett also denies breaching the force’s conduct standards. The tribunal continues.
