If you are trying and failing to access your Barclays account online this morning you are not alone. It appears the UK bank is having some technical issues with thousands complaining that they can't view vital services via the popular smartphone app. The gremlins appear to have begun at around 11am with users seeing a message that reads "Sorry were can't log you in right now" when they attempt to access the application - the outage is still ongoing. Down Detector, which monitors issues across the world, is currently showing over 1,000 reports of Barclays being down so this is clearly a serious problem. Speaking on the Down Detector forum, one user confirmed: "Barclays is down error message 00003 and says can’t log you in right now." Many users have also taken to Twitter to complain about the problems. One user named Stephen said: "@Barclays what’s going on with the app. I cannot login." Whilst another unhappy customer, called Debbie, tweeted: "@Barclays - app and online banking appear to be down. Can you advise?" Barclays has now confirmed that it is having problems with its app. In a post on its service status page, the bank said: "We're sorry if you're having trouble logging into your app - we're working to fix this." There's no word on when a fix will be released but hopefully things will be back up and running soon. MORE FOLLOWS
