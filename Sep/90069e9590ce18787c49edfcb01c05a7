Former Real Housewives of New York star, Bethenny Frankel, launched a furious tirade on Meghan, while speaking on her iHeart podcast Just B. Discussing why she believes the Duchess of Sussex's popularity has plummeted, she said: "The bottom line is I don't think people like Meghan Markle because I think she talks down to other people, I think she's sanctimonious". Ms Frankel then went on to say that, after tweeting criticism about Meghan in 2021 for complaining about the Royal Family when she was earning "hundreds of millions in media deals", an A-list celebrity called her to tell her to take the comments down. She said: "I had a very A-list person call me when I commented on Meghan Markle before the Oprah interview and said to me: 'Can you please take down what you said, they can barely stand up in Frogmore Cottage and they can't afford their security'". This comment has sparked a row amongst royal watchers, with many people arguing that the residence is far larger than the A-lister claimed. @stoneandorchid tweeted a picture of the house and said: "This is Frogmore cottage, a 5 bedroom newly renovated house when they moved in." @countesscommon1 added: "Firstly, why did you have to pay back over £2m pounds in renovation costs for a broom cupboard? "Second, can anyone find a quote when Meghan has ever expressed any gratitude for any of the benefits she’s accrued or support she got?!"
