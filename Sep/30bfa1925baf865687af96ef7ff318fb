The summer transfer window is finally set to come to a close tonight, with the all-important deadline set to pass at 11pm. A host of clubs from the Premier League and across Europe will be frantically trying to wrap up their business with some last-minute additions in order to strengthen their squads in preparation for the campaign ahead. Manchester United have been among England's highest-spending clubs so far, with the Red Devils splashing in excess of £200million on new players since the end of the previous campaign. The likes of Antony, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen have all joined United in recent months but they are expected to officially complete one deadline-day signing in Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who has agreed to join Erik ten Hag's squad on a season-long loan. Chelsea have also been busy for the duration of the summer market, with new owner Todd Boehly using his millions to land players such as Wesley Fofana, Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella. Arsenal and Tottenham, meanwhile, could look to rival the Blues for signings in the hours leading up to this evening's deadline as the race to beat the clock heats up.
