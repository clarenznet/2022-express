Amanda Holden took to Instagram in a summery crochet dress as she continued her holiday abroad. The Britain's Got Talent judge, 51, wore the garment with one button undone, flashing a hint of her perfect cleavage. The star also opted to go braless for the video. Amanda captioned the clip: "Happy Wednesday darling @pattipinkcake hope to see you for a cappuccino one day in Double Bay." She added the hashtags #ifyouknowyouknow #coatdrop #homage.
