The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union (RMT) said its members will walk out on September 15 and 17. Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: "Network Rail and the train operating companies have shown little interest in offering our members anything new in order for us to be able to come to a negotiated settlement." Aslef and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association have already announced strikes by their members in the coming weeks. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "Yet again, union leaders are choosing self-defeating, co-ordinated strike action over talks." Meanwhile, students face chaos this term after thousands of staff at more than 20 universities voted to strike over pay. Cleaners, administrators, library, catering and security workers are set to walk out after rejecting a three percent pay offer. Union boss Mike Short, of Unison, said: "This ludicrously low increase does nothing to ease the financial pressures for thousands of struggling staff."
