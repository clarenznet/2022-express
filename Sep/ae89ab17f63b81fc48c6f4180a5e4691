Contestants on this year’s hit show promise tantalising tastes from around the globe with the most internationally diverse line-up to date. The 12 amateur bakers come from far and wide, some with families from Saudi Arabia, Poland, Libya and Sweden. There are professions ranging from nuclear scientist James, 25, to nanny Sandro, 30. Also in the mix are Scottish music teacher William, 45, supermarket cashier Carole, 59, from Dorset, and masters student Rebs, 23, from Northern Ireland. All will appear on the first show on Channel 4 on September 13. The youngest of this year’s wannabe winners is 18-year-old Manchester student Maisam while the eldest is 60-year-old London-based former IT manager Dawn. Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith are once again back in the taste testing hot seat for the 10 episodes, alongside jovial hosts Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding.
