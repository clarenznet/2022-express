Timothée Chalamet, 26, looked sensational in a shimmering red ensemble as he attended the screening of Bones and All at the Venice International Film Festival. The Hollywood actor made sure he stood out from the crowd, with his ensemble's backless design, with a fitted slim trouser fit. He paired the look with pointed black boots, along with thin black sunglasses. His only piece of jewellery was one thick ring, and he styled his hair in its regular tight waves. The film Bones and All is centred on a pair of cannibals, played by Taylor Russel and Timothée, who become lovers and take a road trip across the United States.
