Nick Kyrgios won his second round match at the US Open on Wednesday night, but not without any controversy. The Australian defeated Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (3), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to advance to the third round in what can only be described as both a fiery and intense encounter. The 27-year-old , who he revealed he suffers from asthma post-match, complained of smelling marijuana smoke in the crowd, before hurling abuse at his own box and spitting on the court. “It was f***ing marijuana. It was smoke. Obviously I'm not going to complain about food,” Kyrgios could be heard saying over the on-court microphone. “When athletes are running side to side and they have asthma, it's probably not ideal.” The Wimbledon finalist was guilty of those committing two aforementioned offences during his campaign at the All-England Club this year. His actions frustrated compatriot and tennis legend Todd Woodridge, who claimed the world number 25’s team should leave the court mid-match should Kyrgios lash out once again. "At some point the people who are sitting in his players box need to take some action," Woodbridge said on the Channel 9 broadcast.

They've got nothing to do with what goes on on the court. That is up to Nick.” After winning the first two sets, Kyrgios suffered a wobble as his resilient opponent took the third.   “Why does he (Kyrgios) want his player's box to tell him what to do when he's coach-less? I mean, goodness me,” he said. “The amount of energy he expends unnecessarily, it wears him out. He is so much better when he doesn't do that ... he's angry with himself.” Kyrgios will play American J.J. Wolf in round three, who upset 16th seed Roberto Bautista Agut in round one.
