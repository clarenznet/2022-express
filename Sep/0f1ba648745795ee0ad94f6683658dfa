Andrew Tate has vowed to face KSI and True Geordie on the same night after both men called him out. The controversial internet celebrity is a former four-time ISKA kickboxing world champion and has been out of the ring for almost six years but is back in training as an influencer fight looms. Speaking during the latest episode of his podcast on Rumble, he said: “I will fight KSI and True Geordie in the same night. Make that for a YouTube boxing show. I will beat both of them. I will beat both of them. Sorry True Geordie, you’re gonna have to take some time off sucking things and go for a run.” The call out comes after the popular northeast YouTuber threatened to punch Tate if he ever ‘gets up in his face’. “I’ve not been the one talking about him for four years bro. This is literally the first time I’ve ever talked about him. I couldn’t give a shit about Andrew Tate,” he told the FLAGRANT podcast. “If he came up to me in my face I would absolutely punch him in the face but am I going to make effort to go running every morning, no. He’s not worth that. He’s not worth that. “We can go do it right here, right now but I’m not getting in the ring and making effort. He’s not worth it. I’ve got a podcast and a business to run, I’m not going to take time out to worry about Andrew Tate.” KSI recently fought two men on the same night during the first DAZN X Series event. The British YouTube star opened up his own card by knocking out rapper Swarmz in the second round before closing the show three hours later with a third-round stoppage victory over 2-6 professional boxer Luis Pineda. After his wins, he called out a number of well-known names including Tate as his fierce rivalry continues following the entrepreneurs’ threats to break ‘every bone in Olatunji’s face’. Tate has also been linked to fights with Jake and Logan Paul and is understood to be training out of a gym in Bosnia in preparations for a potential showdown with one of the high-profile names.
