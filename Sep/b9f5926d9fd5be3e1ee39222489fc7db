In her latest interview with US publication The Cut, Meghan made more claims about her time as a senior royal. But the Daily Mail's royal editor Richard Eden, believes the Duchess of Sussex could have more to say. Meghan revealed for the first time that she kept a daily journey before she stepped away from royal life with Prince Harry, sparking fears she has more to tell. Mr Eden said: "She made a series of very unsubtle hints that she could say a lot more in the future. It seemed to be clear that they were threats. "She was coming across as saying, ‘I can say these things, I’ve chosen not to.’" It comes as the Duke and Duchess prepare to return to the UK to visit charities "close to their hearts", just a few months before Prince Harry is due to release his highly-anticipated memoir.
