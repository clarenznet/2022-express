Viewers tuned into the E4 reality show were horrified when Thursday's episode ended and a preview for Monday's instalment saw groom Kwame, 42, saying he usually goes for "a girl who's more petite". Married at First Sight fans quickly took to social media to complain about his comments, labelling them as "fatphobic" and suggesting experts should "be ashamed" over the pairing of the two, which will be shown in full in next week's episode. As Thursday's episode ended, a trailer for next Monday's was shown, and as always, drama is on the cards. The preview showed how four more singles would be meeting their partners at the altar. Kwame can then be heard saying: "More often than not, I go for someone more petite," as his bride Kasia is left looking upset. In another scene, Jasia is seen telling him: "intimacy is really important to me," as the two explore their hotel room.

Pointing towards the big four-poster, he adds: "I'll take this one". Needless to say, his remarks didn't go down well with viewers though. Angered fans were not pleased by his attitude, with Twitter user @megeggeggs writing: "The fatphobia that always pops up on these shows makes me want to nuke the whole planet. Why are men like this I hate you #MAFSUK." @JoMay28 penned: "So we've got a lovely bit of fat shaming to look forward to in the next episode #MarriedAtFirstSight #MarriedAtFirstSightUK #MAFSUK #MAFS." @lauragabell shared: "Nah the ‘experts’ should be ashamed for matching that couple in the next ep imagine what watching that back & hearing him talk about normally going for more petite would do to that poor girl. "They should have 100% established if someone’s that bothered by size beforehand?! #MAFSUK." "Whatever piece of s*** said 'I usually go for a girl who is more petite' can get F*****. Hate him already #MAFSUK," shared @beckhallx. @jemmaisntcool added: "Already don't like the guy who's complaining that she's not "petite" #MAFSUK." DON'T MISS...

"I've still not told Zoe, it's kind of looming over my head now," a bride can be heard saying. She adds: "I don't know if she's going to take it well." It's unknown what the big secret could be, but it's bound to be explosive. DON'T MISS...

Harry Potter fan Jess thought she had married the perfect man when she discovered her groom, Pjay, also loved the book and film series. However, once she learned Pjay was a stripper, she became upset and threatened to leave, not wanting to attend her wedding reception. After some stern words from Jess' mum, Pjay explained his career choice to Jess and she seemed to have moved past the news by end of the episode. Married at First Sight continues on Monday at 9pm on E4.
