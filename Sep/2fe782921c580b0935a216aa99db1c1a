Rico Burton was fatally stabbed outside a bar in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of August 21. Liam O'Prey, 21, has since been charged with his murder. Tributes poured in for the 31-year-old, with the boxer's cousin Tyson Fury leading. The two-time world heavyweight champion, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, called for an end to knife crime in a post on his social media channels following his cousin's death. Today, Mr Burton's family and friends bid an emotional goodbye to him, reports Manchester Evening News. The service took place at St Michael's Church in Urmston, Greater Manchester. Mourners arrived for the service on carriages and trailers, with one being pulled by a horse. A trailer carrying a huge, white floral arrangement for him was also spotted, while another carried flowers that spelt out his name. Dozens were expected to turn out to pay their respects to Mr Burton at the service. Shaun Egan, who previously coached Mr Burton alongside his brother Steve at Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Manchester, described him as "such a nice lad". "He was an absolute talent," he said. "He was such a nice lad, he was hard working and had a great sense of humour. "What's happened is just awful. He was just a great guy. To hear he has died like this is devastating."  O'Prey appeared at Manchester Crown Court on August 26 charged with Mr Burton's murder. He faces four counts relating to the same incident. Mr O'Prey is accused of murder; unlawful wounding with intention to cause grievous bodily harm; possession of a bladed article; namely a knife; and possession of cocaine. He could go on trial at the beginning of next year. He has been remanded into custody. A 17-year-old was also seriously wounded in the incident and was given "life-saving" treatment at the scene, police said.
