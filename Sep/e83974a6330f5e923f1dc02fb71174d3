The cap will be in place from January to March next year, the Government has said. Transport secretary Grant Shapps called the measure a "direct help" to UK public transport users.  The Department for Transport (DfT) said the £60m plan may save bus-users more than £3, when buying a single ticket. The Government department cited an average fare of £2.80 for a journey of three miles, with the new cap meaning a 30 percent saving. The DfT said the new cap will help "millions with travel costs for work and essential journeys". Mr Shapps added: "Buses are by far and away the most used form of public transport, so ensuring that almost all bus journeys are no more than £2 will assist passengers over the winter months and provide direct help to thousands of households across the country.  "This £60 million boost will mean everyone can affordably get to work, education, the shops and doctor’s appointments. "We know people will be feeling the pressure of rising costs this winter, and so we have been working hard this summer to provide practical concrete help that will lower daily expenditure." A £2 cap will come into effect from Sunday for Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. This comes after the DfT announced a £130m package for bus networks around the UK.
