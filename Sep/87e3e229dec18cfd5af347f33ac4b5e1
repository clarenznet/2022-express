Tumble dryers are great for speeding up the drying process but are one of the costliest household items. With the colder season steadfastly approaching, there is a simple item shoppers love using to cut down their drying time and save energy bills. As of October 1, 2022, the Ofghem energy price cap increase will commence and in turn energy bills will increase. Uswitch estimates that a tumble dryer uses 4.5 kWh of energy per cycle, which works out to approximately 67p per cycle. Shoppers have found a simple product that can help cut down drying time and in turn, reduce energy bills. An ecoegg Dryer Egg can reduce tumble drying time by up to 28 percent. Available on Amazon, it works by gently separating the clothes which allows more air to circulate so they dry quicker. It can also be useful in reducing your plastic usage and dryer eggs can be used over and over again. In addition, you don’t need to add fabric softener as the egg’s nodules soften the fibre of your clothing. An ecoegg laundry egg is now reduced to £7.50 from £11.99, saving 37 percent off its original price. BUY: Ecoegg Laundry Egg (£7.50) One laundry egg can last 70 washes which works out to just 10p a wash. Chemical free and ideal for sensitive skin, Amazon reviewers love using it to quicken their washing cycle. Steph wrote: “I decided to buy an eco egg thinking it would last me about 6 months or so... Well I can't even remember when I bought it but it must be about a year ago! I have saved so much money and plastic!” Mrs P Carter also agreed: “I frequently used to complain that my washing machine had an unpleasant odour, and was forever putting it onto an empty hot wash to try and keep it smelling sweet, since the introduction of the egg into our household, this has ceased to be an issue."
