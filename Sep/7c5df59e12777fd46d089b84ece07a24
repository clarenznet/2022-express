The ambulance was pictured this week parked adjacent toÂ Crown & Thistle Bakery in Darwen, Lancashire. Residents believe the paramedics had stopped there to buy a sandwich for their lunch. One disgruntled resident was "gobsmacked" when he looked through the bakery's window and saw the paramedics inside. He told Lancs Live: "They'd obviously just parked there, as other people often do, so they could go inside and grab a butty." "We're getting sick and tired of people parking wherever they want. "It's not the bakery's fault but its popularity means that it's often difficult to park nearby and with its location on the junction there aren't many spaces." The bakery was opened last year by Mo and Julie Zabhi who also owned the Hoddlesden pub of the same name before it closed a few weeks ago so the couple could concentrate on the bakery. A spokesperson for the North West Ambulance Service declined to comment on the incident but said: "Crews sometimes briefly grab some refreshments in between emergency calls and are reminded of their responsibilities to abide by the highway code when not attending 999 incidents." Last month Lancashire Constabulary came under criticism after a police vehicle was spotted parked in a disabled space at a Rawtenstall retail park. One shopper, from Bacup, Lancashire, said: "It seems the police are exempt from badges, and disabled customers like my wife and I had to park 200 yards away to shop." Lancashire Police replied they were investigating an alleged shoplifting incident, but after establishing no offence had taken place there were no arrests. They added that because the call was an emergency they were allowed to park in the disabled bays.
