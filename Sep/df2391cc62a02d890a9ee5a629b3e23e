The latest price cap announcement will pave the way for energy firms to raise their prices again, boosting them from existing annual costs of £1,971. The decision is the second made by officials this year, and aims to provide breathing room for firms amid rising wholesale prices caused by the war in Ukraine. But 2022 isn't the first year Ofgem has adjusted the price cap, as previous years have warranted action for different reasons. Ofgem's price cap is, in essence, still in its infancy, as the organisation first introduced the measure on January 1, 2019. When it debuted, Ofgem capped the annual standard variable tariff (SVT) at £1,137. Before April 1 this year, the organisation had only adjusted it another four times, modestly at first.

After the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) revised the methodology used to calculate the limit in July, Britons ended the year with slightly more expensive bills. A slight increase to the cap saw average annual SVT bills rise to £1,179 by October, an increase of £42 that didn't dramatically alter most energy bills. Monthly energy costs jumped by around £3.50 for SVT customers, from £94.75 to £98.25. Ofgem tightened the cap slightly in October 2020, bringing it back down by £137 to £1,042 with lower wholesale costs. The adjustment saw prices fall for the last time in the price cap's short history, making monthly average SVTs more than £10 cheaper at £86.83. Prices have trended upwards since April 2021, when they rose to £1,138 a year. In October that year, they rose to £1,277, then £1,971 in April 2022, and now people expect £3,549 highs from October 1, 2022. The last Ofgem adjustment in August will leave people with £300 worth of monthly energy bills, but it likely won't mark the end of their woes. The regulators announced last month that they would increase the frequency of their announcements to better adapt to rapidly changing energy prices. They have scheduled four upcoming updates as they move to a quarterly schedule starting in November. By the next cap, experts fear British households may face annual energy bills of up to £5,000.
