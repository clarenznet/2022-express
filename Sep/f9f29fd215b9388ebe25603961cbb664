Andy Murray's US Open third-round clash with Matteo Berrettini was briefly halted as a member of the crowd required immediate medical attention. Murray was down 30-40 on serve with Berrettini looking to break and move one step closer to the fourth round.  But there was clearly some disturbance in the crowd as Murray got ready to serve with the umpire seemingly unaware of what was happening in the stands. He first asked the crowd to quieten down before it was clear a member of the crowd required medical assistance. Jim Courier said on commentary: "There's a bit of a disturbance in the crowd. "There's a person in distress. They need some medical help. That's gonna stop play here for a moment until they can get to this person." Cameras then panned to the crowd where other spectators were surrounding the scene. The match was suspended just for a few minutes though before loud cheers were heard inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. The loud cheers were for the person taken ill, who was back on their feet in a promising sign. "Good news, the person in question who was struggling is up on their feet," he said. "They're being assisted into a wheelchair so we should be getting back underway here."  Both players were back on the court ready to restart action, but were forced to wait a little longer with some fans taking too long to get back in their seats. Murray eventually got the match back underway in what was a decisive moment of the match with Berrettini looking to break serve. But the No 13 seed missed his opportunity, sending a backhand return long before winning the next two points to hold serve and stay in the match. The battle for Murray all match has been troubling Berrettini on his own serve though and that trend continued in the next game. The Italian held for a love-service game, immediately putting the pressure back on Murray. But the former British No 1 dug deep once again to save another break point and keep on top of the set.
