Zara Tindall was seen walking the course on day one of the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials. Zara, who won a silver medal during the London 2012 Olympics as part of the British Equestrian team, will be competing in the event. She finished second here to Pippa Funnell in 2003.  The 41-year-old royal will be riding her horse, Class Affair. The trials begin today and will continue until Sunday 4 September. In May, Zara and Class Affair took home first prize in the advanced class at the Chatsworth Horse Trials. During the Chatsworth Trials, Zara's husband, Mike Tindall, paid a heartwarming tribute to his wife on Instagram  He described Zara as his "sporting idol". Sharing a video of his wife riding Class Affair, he said: "I love seeing my sporting idol doing her thing outside of the golfing arena!!!" He added: "It’s a big year ahead."  Mike is likely to be cheering on his wife once again at the four-day event, alongside their three children, Mia, eight, Lena, four, and Lucas, one. The Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials are taking place in Stamford, Lincolnshire. It is the first time the event has taken place in three years, as it was put on hold as a result of the pandemic.
