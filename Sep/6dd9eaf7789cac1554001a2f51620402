Julianne Moore, 61, showed age is just a number as she took the plunge in a daring black velvet gown for the 79th Venice International Film Festival. The Hollywood star, who is the president of this year's jury, showed off her gym-honed figure in the shoulderless black gown. The gown featured a very low neckline, showing off Julianne's ample assets and toned arms. She complimented the dress with an embellished silver necklace and dazzling dangly silver earrings. Not taking attention away from the statement dress, Julianne opted for a minimal make-up look and styled her signature auburn tresses in a simple straight side-parting.
