Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have all shown an interest in Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz ahead of the transfer deadline, according to reports. An unnamed club is apparently set to bid £20million for the Brazilian. Villa head coach Steven Gerrard did not go as far as ruling out a departure for the defensive midfielder after his side were beaten by Arsenal on Wednesday night. Luiz scored Villa’s goal in the 2-1 reverse direct from a corner - the second time in eight days that he has achieved the feat. That is according to Sky Sports, who claim that Luiz is in-demand. Villa boss Gerrard did not rule out a late move for the former Manchester City man. Luiz has become a key player for Villa in recent seasons, featuring in five of the club’s six matches this season. Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool could take advantage of his contract situation over the coming hours. All three clubs are interested in signing a midfielder. Chelsea have apparently had a £43m offer for Ajax’s Edson Alvarez knocked back by the Eredivisie side - who have lost several key players this summer. Arsenal want to strengthen their options after Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny suffered injuries in the opening weeks of the season. Albert Sambi Lokonga made a rare appearance from the start in the win over Villa on Wednesday. Liverpool have looked light in the position and head coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted that he would like another signing. Luiz is on their list of targets.
