Dramatic pictures show the white Ford Transit van on its side on Hanover Street. The driver was uninjured in the incident which took place at around 8.40am. Police sectioned off the road from the Novotel to restaurant Albert's Schenke on the corner of Duke Street. In chaotic scenes, buses were forced to turn around and go back the other way. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: "We had a report at 8.40am of a Ford Transit van overturned on Hanover St. "No injuries. Some road closures to allow for recovery of van." The van was reportedly carrying out a delivery to a restaurant when it overturned and blocked the road. The driver was uninjured but left "shaking", the Liverpool Echo reports. He was checked at the scene by paramedics. A tow truck arrived to remove the van and the road has since reopened.
