Arsenal are the only team in England's top seven divisions to win every game of the season so far and will be looking to maintain that record tonight against Manchester United. Erik ten Hag's side are in good form of their own with three consecutive wins. But Mikel Arteta has a few late decisions to make on his starting line-up. Express Sport takes a look at who the Arsenal boss is likely to select. Aaron Ramsdale is one of three players Arteta has said faces a late fitness test on whether he will play or not. The 24-year-old played through the pain barrier against Aston Villa after picking up hamstring injury. Matt Turner is ready and available to step in for Ramsdale, but Arteta will want his No 1 available and the England international will also want to test himself against United. Arsenal will have until the evening to assess whether Ramsdale's injury is too serious for him not to play, but it's more than likely he could at least start. With five substitutions available to Arteta, he won't feel like he is wasting one if it becomes clear Ramsdale can't continue. Arteta has made it clear that Oleksandr Zinchenko is still not fit enough to return, meaning Kieran Tierney is set to keep his place in the starting line-up. Zinchenko has impressed since joining from Manchester City and him not being available to face United will be a huge blow, but Tierney is a more than capable replacement.  Gabriel and William Saliba have already established a formidable partnership, conceding just four goals through five games as well as being a threat further up the pitch. But it's on the right-hand side where Arteta may be tempted to make some changes due to United's threat down the wings. Ben White has looked good as a makeshift right-back while Takehiro Tomiyasu builds back up to full fitness, but the United game may be the time to change up to a natural right-sided defender. Arsenal's failure to sign Douglas Luiz on deadline day may come back to the bite them with a mini injury crisis in midfield already. Both Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny are out and while Albert Sambi Lokonga looked strong against Villa, Arteta could well plump White as the defensive midfielder against United.  It's not an unfamiliar role for White as he often played there on occasion for Brighton. His move to midfield at Arsenal will largely depend on whether Arteta has already worked on that scenario in training. Martin Odegaard was forced off against Villa and he's another player facing a late fitness test to prove he's able to play. The Norway international has started the season in terrific form as well, but Arteta has Emile Smith Rowe ready to step in and it may make more sense to start the 22-year-old over Odegaard. If it's not broke then don't fix it. Only Manchester City and Liverpool (courtesy of a 9-0 win) have scored more than Arsenal's 13 through five games. Both Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus are in top form in front of goal while Saka is yet to find the net. The England international has struggled to find his footing so far alongside Jesus, but has shown glimpses of his ability. Eddie Nketiah remains a good option off the bench and he showed against Fulham that he's more than ready to step in when needed. Marquinhos is yet to be used since his summer move, but will likely be given his first minutes against FC Zurich in the Europa League next week.
