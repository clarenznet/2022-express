Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary, vowed the summer of discontent will go on indefinitely until wage demands are met. She claimed Unite members were involved in 450 disputes over the past year and had gained £150million in new wages and benefits as a result.  Ms Graham said: “Workers are simply no longer prepared to accept poverty wages, especially when they know employer after employer is guilty of rampant profiteering. “There could be hundreds of disputes involving tens of thousands of workers over the coming months if employers continue to offer real-terms wage cuts presented as increases.”  The incoming prime minister will be pressured to resolve industrial action across rail, telecoms, ports and the postal sector. Criminal barristers in England and Wales go on indefinite strike tomorrow.
