The ex-Met Commissioner was “constructively dismissed” by the Mayor of London, a review by Sir Thomas Winsor concluded. Mr Khan told Dame Cressida that scandals such as the Sarah Everard case would affect his re-election chances.  He urged her to sack every officer at the heart of the Charing Cross station scandal. A probe by the Independent Office for Police Conduct found officers joked about rape, domestic violence and racism, and used homophobic language. The Mayor last February gave the Commissioner 48 hours to come up with a plan to root out such behaviour in the Met. In his report, Sir Tom – the former Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary – said she “felt intimidated by this process into stepping aside, and I can understand that”.  Mr Khan put her “on notice” after the Charing Cross report, before forcing her to quit, saying he had lost confidence in her. The Mayor said Sir Tom’s review was “clearly biased” and “ignores the facts”. Sir Tom wrote: “No political office-holder should seek to persuade or pressure an independent public servant to act contrary to the law, still less on the basis of political expediency.” Mr Khan risked a legal challenge if the officers were targeted as scapegoats, the report said. Dame Cressida regretted the review was “necessary” and said it was “important that politicians respect due process and not break the rules”.
