Madonna, 64, took to Instagram this evening to promote her new single to her 18.5 million followers with a selfie video. The Like A Virgin hitmaker posted the video that used an Instagram filter, further enhancing the singer's bold red lip and heavy make-up. The filter included a pair of sunglasses, and once they were removed, Madonna made sure to wink for the camera. She captioned the Instagram video: "Strike a pose………with the official filter for Finally Enough Love!!!! Don’t forget to listen to the entire collection OUT EVERYWHERE!!!!!" However, the video received mixed reviews with some fans raising their concern over the star's appearance. Iapodesta said: "Where is the real Madonna. I just don't recognise my idol with all that botox and bad surgery. I would've prefer seeing her age gracefully." Jdfpictures added: "Awful !!!!! Where is the Madonna we knew in the past ???" Many others did however rush to the comments to compliment the "stunning" singer for her talent and "young appearance".
