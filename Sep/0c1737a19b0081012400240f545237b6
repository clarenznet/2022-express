The Channel 5 favourite headed out with her youngsters before they returned to school after the long summer holidays. Taking to Twitter, the mum-of-nine shared a series of snaps on a hillside that overlooked the stunning views. Amanda was pictured with her two dogs as she donned a short skirt, zip-up jacket and a pair of wellies while looking at the view surrounding them. She captioned the post: "Out & about with the dream team," and added the hashtags: "#yorkshire #shepherdess #gathering #sheepdogs."
