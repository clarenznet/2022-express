Britain’s largest building society revealed a cooling off in August amid early signs of the market losing momentum due to soaring inflation and energy costs. Annual growth slowed to 10 per cent in August, down from 11 per cent in July, according to the lender’s latest house price index. However, prices were up 0.8 per cent month-on-month. The average three-bed semi is now valued at £273,751 – £50,000 more than two years ago and up £2,000 in a month. Demand for homes is still outstripping supply and that is bolstering asking prices, according to Iain McKenzie, chief executive of The Guild of Property Professionals. He said: “This is the 13th monthly rise in a row, with prices kept sky-high by limited housing supply on the market. The signs of a slowdown are growing, however, with activity levels falling at the same time as new mortgage approvals drop. “Expected interest rate rises combined with soaring household costs will start to bite in the coming months. “First-time buyers though, many still priced out of the market and hoping to get on the ladder, will have their fingers crossed that prices soften to allow them to take that first step.”
