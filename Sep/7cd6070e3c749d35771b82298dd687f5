There are 90 years between her and great-great-grandmother Marjorie Cowling, seen seated at their meeting last month. Kyla also joins mum Aimee McCue, 27, grandma Nicola McCue, 46, and great-grandma Jan Dicken, 66, on the family tree. Marjorie – who has four children, six grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren – was keen to greet her newest relative. The widow, whose bus driver husband Arthur died in 2003, said: “I’m so proud of Aimee and her lovely little one. Kyla’s so beautiful. I’m so pleased I’m still here to meet her. It’s just so special.” Kyla was born on June 17 and has inherited a cheekiness from her great-great-gran who her family describe as “funny and quirky”. Marjorie grew up on a farm in Pontefract, West Yorks, and worked until her mid-70s, when her family “forced her” to retire. Nicola said: “We’re all grafters – every woman along the family line, starting from my nan. We’re hoping Kyla gets that.” Marjorie lives on her own in Yorkshire while the rest of the women live in Wales. Nicola, who runs the Traders Tavern pub in Cardiff, said: “We visit my nan as much as we can. She still has her sons close by.”
