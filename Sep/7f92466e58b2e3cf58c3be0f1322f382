As Shirley MacLaine, 88, appears on TV this afternoon in Two Mules for Sister, Express.co.uk look back at the actress's early acting career and her enviable good looks and quirky character. In a photoshoot dated 1958, Shirley posed in heels around a swimming pool, giving a rather leggy display. Shirley wore a tight-fitted buttoned swimsuit, showing off her hourglass curves and ample assets. The award-winning Hollywood actress posed holding a shawl as her prop as she danced the sun-kissed day away in the memorable snaps. Shirley recently returned to the small screen in the series Only Murders in the Building alongside stars Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez.
