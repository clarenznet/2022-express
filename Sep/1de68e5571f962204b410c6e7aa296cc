If a person is using the app to check, they can also use their NS&I number. A person’s NS&I number consists of 11 digits long and starts with an 11, 21, 31 or 41. People can find this number in most of the communications they have had from the NS&I.     In June this year, the Premium Bonds fund rate went from one percent to 1.4 percent. This meant that the odds of each £1 Premium Bond number winning a prize changed from 34,500 to one to 24,500 to one. This increased prize fund meant an additional 1.4 million prizes were paid out in June. The NS&I state that the best way to make sure that someone does not miss claiming their prize is to have it paid directly into their bank account or automatically reinvested into more Premium Bonds.
