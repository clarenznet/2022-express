Manchester United could add to their five signings so far this summer on transfer deadline day. Though Erik ten Hag has claimed the club's business is likely done, the Dutchman did also hint the Red Devils will be 'alert' to any opportunities that arise. A deal for Martin Dubravka is expected to be announced today, while the Red Devils haven't entirely given up on Frenkie de Jong. After a slow start, Manchester United have gone on to enjoy a productive transfer window. Tyrell Malacia was the first player to arrive back in July, with the Netherlands international turning down interest from Lyon in order to move to Old Trafford. Lisandro Martinez and Christian Eriksen then followed with the pair, who are familiar with Ten Hag's methods and philosophy, arriving from Ajax and Brentford. United have since recruited Casemiro from Real Madrid, having cooled interest in De Jong a fortnight ago. And Antony has also moved to the Premier League, with the Brazil international arriving from Ajax in a massive Â£84million deal - a fee that makes him the club's joint-second most-expensive signing of all time.
