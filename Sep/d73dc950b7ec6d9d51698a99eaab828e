Bruce Springsteen, 72, looked unrecognisable as he posed alongside a fan in a recent snap from last week. Many fans pointed out he bore a striking resemblance to film director Woody Allen, 86.  The star was snapped alongside a fan in Brussels, wearing a grey jumper and black glasses.  Mike Rosenkrantz wrote: “In case you still refuse to feel old - Bruce Springsteen now looks like Woody Allen.”  Malzahnhangs60 penned jokingly, mocking the lyrics for the 1975 hit Born to Run: “Gramps like us/Baby we were born to nap!!!!”  TedInJest said: “The photo of Bruce Springsteen looking like Woody Allen is the craziest thing I've seen on Twitter since the dress.”
