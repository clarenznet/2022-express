Six-year-old terrier Doodles broke free of the restraints and ran to a ditch, where he was found traumatised and cowering by a member of the public who had witnessed the incident. The dog was covered in wounds and suffering from a concussion. The member of the public contacted their local authorities and Doodles was taken into the care of Dogs Trust Ireland, reports The Irish Mirror. Through the charityâ€™s Regional Rehoming Programme, he was able to receive the urgent veterinary treatment he needed and was placed with a local foster family where he could recover in the comfort of a loving home. Dogs Trust Ireland, which currently has 231 dogs in its care, is urgently appealing for foster families so that it can continue to provide a life-saving service. Commenting on the harrowing incident, Eimear Cassidy, Regional Rehoming Manager at Dogs Trust Ireland, said: "What happened to Doodles is absolutely appalling, and something that should never happen to any sentient being. "We are so grateful to the person who reported the incident and the family who fostered him and helped nurse him back to the fantastic condition he is in today. "Sadly, we are seeing upsetting cases like this more frequently. These poor dogs have been through so much, so to be able to be there for them, and help find a home locally where they will be treated with love is what gets us through the sadness of cases like this. "We cannot do this without our incredible network of foster families, so we are urgently appealing for more families to open their heart and home for dogs across the country. "Thankfully for Doodles, his story ended happily as his foster family fell in love with him and decided to make his foster home his forever home." So far, the Regional Rehoming Programme has found loving homes for 530 dogs from Cork to Cavan and everywhere in between.
