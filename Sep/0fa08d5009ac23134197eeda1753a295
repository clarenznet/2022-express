Rafael Nadal has admitted he needs to "play better" as he bids to win a fifth US Open title. Nadal has progressed to the third round of the tournament with wins over Rinky Hijikata and Fabio Fognini. However, the 36-year-old is yet to find his best form, having dropped the opening set to both Hijikata and Fognini. Defending champion Daniil Medvedev and number three seed Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, have both won their first two games in straight sets and Nadal is well aware that he needs to up his game if he is to go all the way at Flushing Meadows.
