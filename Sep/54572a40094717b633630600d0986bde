Despite fuel prices having dropped slightly in recent weeks, they still remain high. The current RAC Fuel Watch indicates that motorists will have to pay 169.58p per litre of unleaded and 183.74p per litre of diesel on average. With this in mind, motoring experts have reminded drivers to use the highest gear possible when embarking on journeys. By using the highest gear possible within the speed limit, drivers can boost their fuel economy. Excessive speed is the biggest fuel-guzzling factor, with drivers being urged to have a light right foot. This will ensure all acceleration is gentle, which is very important to fuel-efficient driving.

In urban areas, drivers are advised to change up through the gears as quickly as they can with the lowest revs possible. The faster the engine spins, the more fuel the vehicle uses. Mark Akbar, Managing Director at CarStore, urged drivers to monitor how they use their gears, as this could save money.

The optimum speed will differ for every car and will depend on countless factors including the road conditions, the weight of the car and even the weather. The speed of 56mph has often been talked about as being the optimum speed. This was due to the old fuel consumption test being run at three speeds: urban, 56mph and 75mph – and 56mph was always, unsurprisingly, the most efficient of these. Typically, cars are most efficient at 45-50mph. By driving aggressively and applying brakes suddenly, drivers can burn up to 20 percent more fuel.
