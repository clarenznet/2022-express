The application to demolish a bingo hall in Salford, Greater Manchester, and replace it with 268 homes in three blocks from six to nine storeys high looks almost certain to be approved. It went before the planning and transportation regulatory panel today, and officers have already recommended it for the thumbs up, reports Manchester Evening News. A report to the panel explained the site is surrounded by high-rise residential developments with a police station opposite. But nearby residents expressed concern the building will be too high. In response letters to the planners, they say the blocks should be a maximum of four storeys high. A report to the panel explains that the site is surrounded by high-rise residential developments with Pendleton Police Station opposite.  One says that residents on the fourth floor and above of Beech Court currently have views of Buile Hill Park, Winter Hill and the moors. It goes on: "This development is very close and will take away that sense of space that has been really helpful, particularly to people suffering from mental health issues." But an officer's reply to this says: "Unfortunately, no one has a right' to a view." The development would include 117 one-bedroom apartments, 137 with two beds, 10 with three beds and four three-bed maisonettes. Officers are suggesting stipulating affordable housing units numbering between 54 or 94, managed by an affordable housing provider, as a condition of approval. It comes as a partially built home may have to be torn down as it does not have planning permission and breaches fire regulations. The six-bedroom house also "does not comply with building regulations in respect of fire safety and accessibility". Graham Ralph, who lives next door to the property in Trafford, Greater Manchester, applied for retrospective planning permission for the house which is three storeys high, but it was refused.
