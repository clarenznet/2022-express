The BBC Radio Wales host could be seen walking down the steps of a London hair salon as she showed off her golden tresses after opting for a brand new look. The 61-year-old could be seen whipping her hair back and forth, in slow motion clip, before giving a twirl and giving fans an eyeful of her toned physique in bottom-enhancing tight leggings. Carol captioned the post: "So I asked you lovely gang should I go back to brunette or stay blonde. You were 50/50, so I went brondeâ€¦.. "The most glamorous hairdresser in the known universe PETAR at @InanchLondon entertained me in his stunning skirt and heels. You like it? I love it." Some of her 488,000 followers, shared their delight over Carol's new look, as Twitter user, @MilesBentley commented: "You look great blonde Carol, really like the style." @dmartin wrote: "Whatever colour Carol your still looking gorgeous," as @CHallinan added: "Anything you like is good." In an earlier video, Carol took to Instagram and shared she was unsure what hair colour she wanted so put forward a poll to her followers. The results came in with 58 per cent urging the star to go brunette, 17 per cent thought she should stay blonde and 25 per cent opted for bronde - a mixture of the two hair colours.
