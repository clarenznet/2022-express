National Crime Agency deputy ­director Andrea Wilson declared they are “having a very good go” at preventing them. But she stopped short of saying the illegal trips would stop entirely. The NCA has around 60 investigations into suspected people-traffickers accused of smuggling thousands of ­people into Britain. Ms Wilson said: “The numbers are extraordinary and that is a challenge for all of us involved in the tackling of organised immigration crime, specifically the small boats area. “So, working with our ­partners, here and overseas, we are ­absolutely having an impact. Whether we will ever stop the crossings – if I had the answer to that, it would be wonderful. “But we are all certainly, collectively, having a very good go at it and a very good impact.” A total of 8,613 migrants reached the UK in small boats last month. The August crossings, a monthly record, take this year’s total to more than 25,000, more than double the number reached by the same time last year. Home Office sources expect around 60,000 migrants to cross from France this year.
