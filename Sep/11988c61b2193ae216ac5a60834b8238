The case is expected to be heard next month after independent analysis of the potentially damaging and deadly effects of Primodos by experts at the University of Oxford. Actor and Thalidomide campaigner Ricky Tomlinson is backing 1,000 families in their fight against Primodos manufacturers Bayer and Schering – and the Health Secretary for allowing its issue. Primodos, an oral drug containing synthetic hormones, was used in the 1960s and 70s as a pregnancy test. It has led to a decades-long campaign by parents who claim it has caused devastating birth defects and deaths similar to those of Thalidomide. Concerns were raised in 1967 but it was not taken off the market until 1978, and a link to abnormalities has never been formally acknowledged by regulators or the maker. A review of Primodos led by Professor Carl Heneghan, of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford, found a “clear and probable association” of malformations. It said children suffered “avoidable harm”. Previous research has suggested a possible link with babies born with shortened limbs and abnormalities in organs. Bayer denies Primodos was responsible. Earlier litigation against Schering (now owned by Bayer) ended in 1982 when the claimants’ legal team discontinued the case on the grounds there was no realistic possibility of showing Prim­odos caused the congenital abnormalities alleged. Bayer maintains that no significant new scientific knowledge has been produced to call into question the validity of the previous assessment of there being no link between Primodos and the occurrence of abnormalities. It is not commenting on the new litigation. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The scientific evidence available does not support a causal association between Hormone Pregnancy Tests and birth defects.”
