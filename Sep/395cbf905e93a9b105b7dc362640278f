The iconic bow railings and an anchor are visible in the video hosted by OceanGate Expeditions on YouTube. The firm's Rory Golden revealed that one of the most amazing clips shows a boiler which fell to the ocean's floor when the Titanic broke into two. He said: "It was one of the single-ended boilers that was first spotted when the wreck of the Titanic was identified back in 1985." The liner is 450 miles off Newfoundland and more than two miles below the surface of the Atlantic, having sunk on its maiden voyage to the US, above, 110 years ago. Latest details seen in a study of the wreck's decay include a sign engraved by anchor maker Noah Hingley & Sons. Mr Golden added: "It is exciting. We may have discovered a new detail that wasn't as obvious with previous generations of camera technologies."
