Jamie Carragher questioned why Philippe Coutinho had a goal disallowed in Aston Villa’s 1-1 draw with Manchester City. Coutinho fired home a stunning strike late in the second half but VAR did not intervene when it was incorrectly ruled out for offside. Coutinho was adjudged to have been offside before slamming home, but the Brazilian playmaker was later shown to have been onside. The incident was not reviewed by VAR and the goal did not stand. VAR did not intervene in the aftermath because referee Simon Hooper had already blown his whistle - meaning VAR cannot be checked as the ball is deemed to not be in play. The assistant referee had flagged for offside against Coutinho, prompting Hooper to halt the match. Referee Andy Madley had initially awarded a goal after Maxwel Cornet latched onto a loose ball and fired into the roof of the net. But the official was then advised to review the footage and disallowed the strike for a foul on Blues goalkeeper Mendy by Jarrod Bowen. He added: “It was never anything. The goalkeeper spills it. “It then comes too far off him to recover it and then I think he fakes an injury. He fakes a shoulder injury. “Jarrod jumps over him. His trailing foot is there but the goalkeeper could never get the ball, he pushed it too far away. The referee made the correct decision (to initially award the goal), so… I don’t know who it was who done VAR today. “To send the referee over to go and have a look at that was a terrible call. It’s put the referee under pressure. But even then I was thinking, ‘well, there is no way the referee is going to [disallow it], he’ll say it’s fine’. He didn’t and he chalked the goal off.” Villa still managed to take points off City despite being on the wrong end of a poor decision by the officials. Leon Bailey's strike cancelled out Erling Haaland's 10th Premier League goal of the season.
