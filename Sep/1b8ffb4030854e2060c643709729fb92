Back in 2017, John Rhys-Davis was asked what he thought of Amazon making a Lord of the Rings TV series, which became The Rings of Power and debuted this morning on the streaming service. At the time, the Gimli star totally blasted the decision. Rhys-Davies told Den of Geek: “Why we quite need Lord Of The Rings as a TV series baffles me slightly…[it’s] so utterly unprincipled and greedy for money for anything – I mean the extraordinary money they're getting from online gambling and stuff like this, it's just a disgrace. I mean, poor Tolkien must be spinning in his grave.” Express.co.uk caught up with the 78-year-old in the aftermath of these comments and the Gimli star claims he “misspoke”. It turns out Rhys-Davies had originally thought Amazon’s TV series was going to be a remake of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The actor didn’t realise at the time that what became The Rings of Power would in fact be a prequel set during the Second Age of Middle-earth as opposed to the films’ Third Age setting. He told us: “I’m not a great fantasy fan, I confess. I misspoke when I was asked because it was presented to me as ‘what do you think of this remake of Lord of the Rings?’ and I shot from the hip and I misspoke. It isn’t really about that at all.” READ MORE: Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in concert review Rhys-Davis continued: “There are so many other histories attached to it and it's the pre-history and the pre-setting of Middle-earth that Amazon is going to be doing and I wish them well for it. I think a great storyteller’s stories should all be told if they will hold up.” The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is streaming now on Amazon Prime and is set a minimum of 4,959 years before the film trilogy.
