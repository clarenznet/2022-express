Taking to Instagram today, the Maggie May singer's wife gushed over her beau's eldest son as she wished him a happy birthday, as she shared an unseen holiday photo via her stories. Penny looked chic in a floor length white dress which she teamed with a pair of open-toe sandals while perched on a wall. The Loose Women presenter wrapped her arm around her stepson Sean Stewart, in a sweet embrace, as she marked his 42nd birthday with a message. In view of her 160,000 followers, she captioned the post: "Happy Birthday @SeanStewart." The photo was taken when the blended family enjoyed a holiday reunion in Italy on board a yacht on the Amalfi coast last month. Sir Rod also took the opportunity to send birthday wishes to his son as he also uploaded a photo of the father and son together on holiday.
