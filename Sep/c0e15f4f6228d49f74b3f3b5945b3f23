There are 2.6 million over-50s – one in eight – who are not receiving help they need to eat or wash. There are 2.6 million over-50s – one in eight – who are not receiving help they need to eat or wash. The Care & Support Alliance (CSA) of 70 leading charities says the incoming Prime Minister must “take a more intelligent approach to social care” since an “astonishing” level of need is not being met. Age UK found a growing total of over-50s in England fail to access the help they need with washing, eating and using a bed – 70 percent have trouble dressing while a fifth of those with an unmet care need are lonely. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK charity director and CSA co-chairwoman, said: “The long-term neglect of social care services by central government is having very real consequences, not only for the individuals whose lives are at best diminished, and their families who often have to pick up the pieces, but for other public services too, especially the NHS.” She added staff need to be “properly recompensed” – vacancies are up due to uncompetitive conditions. The CSA wants an urgent injection of Government cash, saying reforms “will not and cannot” fulfil the vow departing PM Boris Johnson made to “fix” social care. Mencap’s Jackie O’Sullivan said younger disabled adults find “just getting out of the house is a constant struggle”. The research was based on latest data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing survey, 2018-19.
