Their high value September winners have been chosen, and many Britons will want to check if they are thousands of pounds richer than they were yesterday. With energy bills set to rise, any extra cash could be vital for savers right now. Two Premium Bond holders became millionaires this morning and the winning bond numbers are 409PT785413 and 324MB318235. The first winner from Sefton bough their winning bond in August 2020. They held £50,000 in bonds. The other September jackpot winner, from West Sussex, bought their winning bonds in February 2018. In total, they held £50,000 in Premium Bonds.  The September draw saw 10 people receive £100,000, 19 people receive £50,000 and 40 get a prize of £25,000. Britons are urged to check to see if they have won any of the prizes ranging from £25 to £1million. Premium Bonds are an investment product issued by NS&I, however instead of earning interest, people are entered into a monthly prize draw where they can win between £25 and £1million tax free. Premium Bonds holders can use the nsandi.com prize checker tool and prize checker app to see if they have won. Someone’s chances of winning is completely down to chance - and people may not win anything at all. Currently the odds of a bond winning each month are 24,500 to one for every £1 Bond they have invested. Many of the prizes released each month are for £25. To see if they’ve won, Britons will need to enter their Premium Bonds holders’ number. They can use Amazon Alexa, to tell them the latest winning numbers or use the prize check app on the NS&I website. In May 2022, the financial institution increased the rate from one percent to 1.40 percent which will see around 1.4 million extra Premium Bonds prizes given out. After raising the prize fund rate, NS&I Chief Executive, Ian Ackerley, said: “The new prize fund rate ensures that Premium Bonds are priced appropriately when compared to the interest rates offered by our competitors. “It also ensures that we continue to balance the interests of savers, taxpayers and the broader financial services sector. “Premium Bonds customers will benefit from the chance to win a further 1.4 million tax-free prizes each month, as well as the peace of mind that customers get with 100 of their NS&I savings being backed by HM Treasury.” Britons are urged to check if they have won anything as there is an estimated £74million left in unclaimed Premium Bond prizes. Each investment in the bonds must be £25, and they can be purchased online, over the phone or by post. Money to buy bonds can be paid in from another NS&I account. As a Government-backed scheme, it is safe to deposit money in them and there are no penalties for people who need to take out cash.
