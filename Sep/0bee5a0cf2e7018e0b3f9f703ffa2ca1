Prince Charles and Camilla's relationship became public in 1994 when the Prince of Wales admitted in a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby that he had been unfaithful to Princess Diana during their marriage. In light of this, the Princess of Wales attended a public event dressed in what would become known as the "revenge dress". It was a beautiful and bold black piece with bare shoulders and a skirt slit.  She looked amazing, and many applauded her for taking the news of Charles’ affair off the front pages of all the newspapers. Princess Diana made the appearance at the Serpentine Gallery in 1994. The glamorous, shoulder-baring mini dress was designed by Christina Stambolian.    One such host said: "It’s a funny old world, isn’t it? "Camilla dresses up like this to please her man and Di does it to p*** him off!  "What’s poor old Charles supposed to do? "For years the papers were after him to own up to a little rumpy-pumpy, and now they’re after him for doing it!" Prince Charles was reportedly furious that the following day after his Jonathan Dimbleby interview, there was very little about it in the papers. This was because Diana landed all the front pages, hence why her outfit was dubbed the "revenge dress".
