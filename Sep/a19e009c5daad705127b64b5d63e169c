In 1960 he formed The Springfields with sister Dusty on vocals and him and Tim Feild playing guitars. Island Of Dreams was one of their hits along with Say I Won't Be There. A cover of Silver Threads And Golden Needles made history as a British group's first single to reach the Top 20 of the American Billboard chart. The band broke up in 1963, with Dusty pursuing a solo career, but her brother had equal success as a producer and songwriter. He saw the potential of an Australian folk-pop group, The Seekers, and in 1965 wrote their first No.1 hit, I'll Never Find Another You. In the same year the group sold more than a million records with the legendary song The Carnival Is Over. With Carry on Star Jim Dale, he wrote another hit for The Seekers called Georgy Girl. Dusty meanwhile had a Top 10 British hit with her brother's song Losing You in 1964. For Jose Feliciano, Tom penned Adios Amor (Goodbye My Love) and Anita Harris struck gold with Just Loving You in 1967, a song co-written with Norman Newell. Born Dionysius Patrick Anthony O'Brien, he grew up in West Hampstead and lived in Ealing, London, where he started taping songs with younger sister Mary in the garage. They went on to sing at Butlin's holiday camps. They changed their surname to Springfield because it was popular in the US. He became Tom, while his sister took on her childhood nickname, Dusty. After her death in 1999, he fulfilled her last wish to have her ashes scattered in Ireland.
