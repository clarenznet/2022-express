Abid Hussain, who runs Family Mart in Lingdale, North Yorkshire, says people come into his shop crying because they can't pay for essentials and the situation is "only going to get worse" as bills start to rise. Some customers never return to pay their debt though and Abid fears the trend will continue. Speaking to Teesside Live, Abdi said: "Some of them can't afford it, some are a bit embarrassed, they promise you 'next week'. I don't count it. But there must be Â£2,000 worth of receipts on the wall, it goes right round." "We are a small village and people are going through difficult times. We're a local, community-serving business. "People are already suffering - you can see it already. With fuel bills going up, it's only going to get worse. We've done this for many years, people are already in hardship. "It's hard for a small business, we have overheads at the end of the day. Our electricity is going up."  Abid wants to give away 20 to 30 "free, hot meals" over the winter and is hoping to work with the parish council on a voucher scheme. "This winter is going to be horrible for people," he says. "When the prices start going up, some people will really feel it. "It really is going to get bad. We have to look out for our vulnerable people. "Some people come straight in and ask, others are proud and they don't want to. But they can come in and hand the voucher over and take a hot meal. We need to all work together." Lingdale is a small village, a short distance east of Middlesbrough.
