Employees have been advised to weigh up the cost of their commute against the soaring price of energy from October 1. Those paying less than £30 a week for travel are possibly better off going into the office to save money, comparison service Uswitch said. A typical household will run up a £363 monthly bill for gas and electricity under the new £3,549 price cap for the three months from October 1. However, full-time home workers are estimated to increase their daily gas use by 75 percent based on them having the heating on for an extra 10 hours a day during the coldest months. And electricity use is predicted to rise by 25 percent as they cook meals and prepare cups of tea at home.
