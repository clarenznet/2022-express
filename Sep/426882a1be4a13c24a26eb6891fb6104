Jessica Chastain, 45, is the recipient of several accolades including an Oscar as well as a Golden Globe award - and is known for her bright red locks. However, earlier this summer the Hollywood actress ditched her fiery hair colour in favour of bright blonde. Jessica was pictured on the set of her upcoming film, Mothers' Instinct, showing off her new look. She cut a casual figure in a light brown trench coat, loose jeans, a grey t-shirt, paired with white trainers. The upcoming psychological thriller will follow the friendship of two housewifes in the 1960s as their life deteriorates following a tragedy in the town. You can watch Jessica Chastain in The Martian at 10pm on Channel 4
