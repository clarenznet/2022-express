It shows the PM with the Met wearing a stab vest as he was filmed by and speaking to a man already in the property. The footage comes after Mr Johnson attended a raid with specialist officers near Lewisham, south London, yesterday. A man says to the camera in the posted video: "Bro, how the **** did I get raided and Boris Johnson's there." The camera shows him opening a door to find police officers and the Prime Minister. He asks Mr Johnson what is going on and the PM says: "Good morning, how are you doing?" No arrests were made.
