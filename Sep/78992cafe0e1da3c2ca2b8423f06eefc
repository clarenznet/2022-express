Fortunately, Express Online is here to help, courtesy of some spoiler-free hints for Wordle 441 on September 3. Just head towards the bottom of the page for the latest hints, and remember to check back tomorrow for the next set of clues. The perfect game to play over your morning toast, or while relaxing out in the garden, Wordle tasks players with figuring out a five letter word in just six guesses. In order to solve each puzzle you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles after each guess. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, as well as your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your precious winning streak.
