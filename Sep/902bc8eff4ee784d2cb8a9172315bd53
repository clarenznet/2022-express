Rangers legend Ally McCoist couldn't hide his pain in watching his former side being torn to shreds by rivals Celtic in the first Old Firm derby of the season. Celtic have set the standards in the Scottish Premiership this season with Rangers trailing their rivals by four points heading into the derby. Celtic Park was rocking ahead of kick-off with Rangers hoping to close the gap to their arch rivals. But they got off to the worst start possible when Liel Abada finished brilliantly inside the box after just seven minutes of play. Rangers were all over the place and were fortunate the second didn't come until the half hour mark with Jota scoring brilliantly from a tight angle. Abada scored a third just before the break to put Celtic in cruise control with McCoist left feeling exactly like every other Rangers fan watching. Speaking after Jota's goal, McCoist was unable to hide his frustration at Rangers' lack of effort. "I'm gonna tell you something," McCoist said on Sky Sports.  "The touch is excellent, the finish is absolutely exquisite. It's breaking my heart. What a goal that is. "The finish is absolutely sublime. But I'm gonna take you back to the free-kick. As soon as the free-kick is taken, there's three Rangers players switch off. "Kamara, Kent and Lundstrom not looking at the ball at all and facing the wrong way.Take nothing away from the goal because the finish is, as much as it pains me, is sublime."  But Celtic fans were mocking McCoist on social media with the hosts running Rangers off the park. @LizMM67 tweeted: "McCoist is loving Angeball, it must pain him to even hint at it." @91st_minute wrote: "Ally McCoist is unraveling here.
