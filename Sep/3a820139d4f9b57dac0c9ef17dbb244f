 Holly Willoughby, 41, has marked the end of the summer holidays with a sweet photo of her eldest son, Harry. The This Morning host keeps her children’s faces obscured on social media, but could be seen cuddling up with her beloved boy on the sofa. Looking makeup free and stunning as ever, Holly wore a grey and white striped dressing gown, her hair in a loose bun, as she wrapped her arm around Harry, 13. Holly shares Harry, as well as Belle, 11, and Chester, seven, with her husband Dan Baldwin, with whom she recently celebrated 15 years of marriage. In the caption, she remarked on how her getup blended in with the similarly patterned sofa. "All the stripes and all the feels… soaking up the last few moments before back to school,” she wrote alongside an apple emoji, perhaps referencing the apple of her eye. Her This Morning co-star Alison Hammond commented: “Every time I see you I feel peace”. Clearly touched by this remark, Holly responded: “I think that’s the nicest thing anyone has ever said… love you darlin”. Aujla5 added: “@alisonhammond55 this is so true!” Starrrryeyed_ agreed: “i second that…  also to add, everytime i see you @alisonhammond55 i feel happiness …”
