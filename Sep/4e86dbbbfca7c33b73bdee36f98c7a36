Ten months ago, the Prime Minister gave hope to ­thousands of people living with the terminal condition, by promising the money in response to a Sunday Express campaign. His pledge came four months after we launched our Fund The Fight To Cure MND ­crusade and joined forces with a coalition of patients, scientists and charities.  In one of his final acts as the country’s leader, Mr Johnson has today stated that this vital ­funding will be ring-fenced. He has also said a streamlined application process for the UK’s leading researchers to access large chunks of the money, which was agreed after weeks of tough talks with MPs and civil servants, will be honoured. Earlier this year, the United To End MND ­coalition was left dismayed when told that scientists would have to make between 100 and 300 applications for small chunks of the £50million.  Campaigners said that this would have delayed research by decades. However, a compromise was reached. Dr Brian Dickie, director of research development at the MND Association, welcomed the news, saying: “During the campaign highlighted by the Sunday Express, one of the key things we wanted from the Government, alongside the £50million investment, was an assurance that the money could be accessed by the researchers quickly and easily. “We’re pleased the Prime Minister has recognised the need for a streamlined application ­process to allow researchers to focus more on the science and less on the bureaucracy and accelerate progress into finding effective treatments for this devastating disease.”
