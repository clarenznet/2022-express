Tyson Fury has responded to Mahmoud Charr's recent call out. The Gypsy King says he will take the fight if his proposed undisputed heavyweight unification clash with Oleksandr Usyk falls through in a bizarre turn of events. Earlier today, Charr called out Fury via an Instagram video, saying: “Tyson. Tyson Fury. Take the fight. I’m ready. I challenge you out, take my challenge, I’m ready for you man, no excuses.” And now, it appears the German boxer can be added as an unlikely potential match-up for the Mancunian as he makes his return to the ring. “Diamond boy, I’ve got a certain little middleweight that I’ve got to put that fist through first, however, if he don’t want no smoke, you can surely get it. Pressure will break diamonds," Fury told Charr. Charr is a former WBA (regular) champion who is seen more as a gatekeeper than a contender these days. Diamond Boy is currently 33-4 having fallen to defeat against Vitali Klitschko, Alexander Povetkin, Johann Duhaupaus, and Mairis Briedis in previous bouts.  Yet Fury is not completely averse to the idea of fighting him as an alternative. However, according to reports, he is in negotiations with the Ukrainian to book the first undisputed heavyweight unification clash of the four-belt era for February next year. Initially, it was rumoured that the contest was being targeted for December 17 in Riyadh, but Fury’s US promoter Bob Arum has since come out to affirm that it is “highly unlikely” to happen in 2022.
