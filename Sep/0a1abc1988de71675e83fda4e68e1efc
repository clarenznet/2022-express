Carol Vorderman has shared a series of eye-popping pictures as she enjoyed a relaxing facial. The Countdown legend, 61, looked chilled out as she snapped a series of photos during and after her treatment. In a couple, Carol opted to forgo her clothes and just cover up with a towel as she shardÂ the "mirror selfies". She wrote: "Oooh had a lovely facial this week. A lymphatic drainage massage. Just lovely.... "Tried to do some mirror selfies...not sure I succeeded...looking all hoity toity and posh in one of them. Lols. As if. I couldn't be that if I actually tried. "Once a commoner...always a... Happy weekend xx," she ended her post.
