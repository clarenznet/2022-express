Gerard Christopher Turner, 56, was with his family in Lezzono, Lake Como, near the Alps when he went for a walk on his own. He was last seen at 2.30pm last Friday when he left his family behind at the hotel. Mr Turner called his wife at 4.15pm to say he had gone down a "rough path" and would be back late, Italian newspaper Il Giorno reports. His family became worried when he had not returned by 6pm. They tried to call him but were unable to get through to his mobile phone. They alerted the emergency services and an urgent search was launched for the 56-year-old. Around 50 people searched the mountain overnight including volunteers and technicians from the 19th Alpine Rescue Delegation, firefighters, Civil Protection and the Carabinieri. They concentrated on the area of Carvagnana, between Nesso and Pognana Lario, where Mr Turner's mobile was last detected. A rescue dog unit was brought in to help with the search, while a helicopter was deployed with a thermoscanner. Drones eventually found Mr Turner's body at the foot of a cliff in an inaccessible area in the mountains.
