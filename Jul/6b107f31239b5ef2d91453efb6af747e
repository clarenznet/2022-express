The star, 73, cut a chic figure in an all-black ensemble as she headed to SW19 to watch the ninth day of the championships. Vera wore her naturally brown tresses in her signature straight, sleek style down her shoulders. The fashion designer donned a fitted black blazer which she paired with sheer-look leggings of the same colour which highlighted her petite frame. Going heavy on accessories, Vera modelled an oversized pair of sunglasses and carried a monochrome handbag which complimented her overall look. The star wore a clunky platform heel to attend the championships, which added inches to her height.
