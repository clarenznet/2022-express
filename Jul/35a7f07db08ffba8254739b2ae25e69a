Mariah Carey, 53, decided to soak up the sun and take a dip in the sea wearing a full-length gown in the waters of Capri, Italy. The Dream Lover hitmaker showed off her cleavage in the low-cut dress with a plunging neckline as she splashed in the water. The superstar, who often showcases her glamourous style, looked stunning in the long-sleeved glittering gown as she marked the end of her holiday getaway. The mother-of-two pulled her long blonde curly tresses into a bun and sported a pair of black sunglasses atop her head. The legendary performer wore glamouros makeup for the occasion, rocking voluminous eyelashes and a hint of bronze eyeshadow. Taking to Instagram on Tuesday, the singer captioned the post: "Ciao Capri."
