It feels like our pleasant western world is changing, very suddenly, for the worse. Now, in America, the federal consensus on abortion, always fraught with conflict, has changed so that women will no longer have a constitutional right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.  Their right to choose (even after rape) will depend very much on the state they live in. Meanwhile the status of womanhood itself is insulted and demeaned by official bodies too scared to call us by our name. To them we are merely “people with a cervix” or “people who are pregnant”. After decades of sunlit uplands, we’re now living in dark times... our values under almost constant grave attack. We’ve been lulled by comfort into decadence. We must fight back. It’s the only way.  This time last year was when I finally lost it with Boris Johnson. It was the G7 summit in Cornwall, where our preening PM posed for matey pics with Mssrs Macron, Trudeau and Biden, while his wife wore fetching shepherdess frocks and flounced about like Marie Antoinette on the beach with her toddler. The nation fumed at the telly. This year, like Stepford wives, the G7 spouses were photographed hiking daintily in the German mountains. It’s embarrassing and ridiculous. Why do they do it?
