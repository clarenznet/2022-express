Its "micromobility" hub in London will mean a million extra deliveries each year - and more sites are likely nationwide. Delivery staff will ride e-cargo bikes and walk to homes and offices in the heart of the capital, replacing thousands of van trips on congested roads. Amazon already has 1,000 electric vans on UK roads and aims to ensure half its shipments are carbon net-zero by 2030 - and all of them by 2040. John Boumphrey, Amazon's UK country manager, said: "Our new e-cargo bikes, walkers and growing electric vehicle delivery fleet will help us make more zero emission customer deliveries than ever before across London and the UK in the coming months."
