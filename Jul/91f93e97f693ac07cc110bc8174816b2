Feed It Back surveyed 58,060 people and found that more than a third (36 percent) plan to spend less this summer at pubs and restaurants. Soaring energy, fuel and grocery costs mean just five per cent of consumers say they will be spending more on drinks and meals out. Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality boss, said: "Hospitality is facing an onslaught of challenges, not least the drop in consumer confidence which is affecting visits and spend in the sector as these figures show. "On top of this, businesses are suffering from soaring costs across the board and a staffing crisis that leaves one in seven hospitality jobs now unfilled." Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: "We urge the Government to cut business rates and undertake at and corporation tax reviews for hospitality businesses." The survey by the hospitality data company found that 59 percent are less likely to book a venue if payment is needed upfront. Dan Hawkie, managing director of Feed it Back, said customers were struggling with the rising cost of living. He added: "As a result, they're looking for better experiences when they do choose to go out and spend their money - substandard food or service won't be accepted." Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: "Summer months are usually some of our industry's busiest. So, whilst unsurprising, this news will come as a further blow to pubs across the country who are battling against rising costs themselves, with only one in three currently making a profit."
