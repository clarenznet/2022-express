Royal commentator Angela Levin said Prince Harry appeared “pitiful” during his United Nations speech to mark Nelson Mandela day. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to New York where Harry delivered a keynote address, covering everything from climate change, abortion rights in the USA, and his love for his wife Meghan. Ms Levin said: “Harry wears his heart on his sleeve and at the UN looks very low. “Strange how Meghan was grasping one of his hands and holding his arm with another but neither of them even looked at each other. It is pitiful.” In response to Ms Levin’s observations, Australian entertainment journalist Peter Ford agreed. He said: “He looks so sad and so angry Angela. Like he’s fallen into a pit and can’t climb his way out.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
