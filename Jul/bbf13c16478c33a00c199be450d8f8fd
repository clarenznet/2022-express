Boris Johnson has decided to make a number of ministerial changes to his government, although he's soon to leave Downing Street. Former Business Secretary Greg Clark has been appointed Levelling Up Secretary, replacing Michael Gove. The Government will have a number of new faces in prominent posts for the remainder of Mr Johnson's premiership. He had a number of vacant roles to fill after more than 50 government MPs resigned this week. Greg Clark returns to the Government as Levelling Up Secretary, after previously working as Theresa May's Business Secretary. Elsewhere, James Cleverly returns to the cabinet as the new Education Secretary. Opposition parties were concerned that Johnson's cabinet reshuffle was a prelude to the PM continuing his reign. Mr Johnson reportedly wanted to cling to power for another three months. It would allow the Conservative party enough time to go through a leadership contest to find a new Prime Minister. However, given the carnage within Government this week, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Scottish National Party have all ordered Mr Johnson to leave Downing Street immediately. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned the Tory party he would call a vote of no confidence if Mr Johnson refused to leave immediately. He said: "If they don't get rid of him, then Labour will step up in the national interest and bring a vote of no confidence. "We can't go on with this prime minister clinging on for months and months to come."
