Demi Rose has taken to Instagram to put on a busty display in a daring, cut out bikini as she returns to Ibiza. The model, 27, shared a series of snaps with her 19.8 million followers of herself taking a "sunset swim" in the barely-there swimsuit which struggled to contain her assests. Posing on the steps of a boat, Demi was the picture of glam in bright red lipstick. She wore her wet hair slicked back out of her face after taking a dip. In the second pic, Demi looked out over an incredible sunset as she showcased her peachy rear.
