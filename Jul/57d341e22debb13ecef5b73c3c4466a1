Local media has shared a video in which plumes of thick smoke billow into the sky. Twitter account @UkraineNewsLive shared the video from RIA Melitopol, commenting: "The #Melitopol media report a massive strike near the local airfield where the #Russian occupiers are based. Now there is smoke in several places". The airstrike reportedly hit a Russian military base, specifically one of four near Melitopol. Nearby residents told local news outlet RIA MelitopolÂ about 15 explosions were heard at 3am on Sunday. Then, another succession of explosions was heard at around 5am. Residents also said bright flashes in the sky could be seen from different parts of the city. Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov officially commented on the explosions, though to be at the military airfield. In a statement, he said: "Tonight in Melitopol resembled the night of February 24, when the rashists attacked Ukraine and began the occupation of Melitopol. "To hide behind a human shield, the invaders placed four military bases in the city. "Today, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed one of the bases. "At 3am and around 5am, shots were fired exclusively at the military base. "Today, rashists are trying to withdraw the surviving equipment, but nothing is left there. "The city is in smoke and this has been going on for several hours, as the fuel and lubricants warehouse is on fire, which were also located on the territory of the military base."  The Russian administration has placed the occupied city under blockade, closing the roads to and from Melitopol. Mr Fedorov also warned citizens that the occupiers are trying to spread misinformation that the shelling targeted residential areas, although the target was exclusively military bases. Evacuations from Melitopol continue as, according to the Ukrainian mayor, a large flow of people wishing to evacuate will be able to transport to Zaporizhia.
