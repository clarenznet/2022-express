Footage captured as the scene shows members of the public lifting the panting dog onto a trolley, borrowed from the nearby Primark, as its legs buckled beneath it. According to onlookers, the dog was suffering from problems caused by the heat, and its owner said they had taken the pooch outside to cool down because their home was hot.  One member of the public said the pup panted and dribbled in the 35-degree heat on Monday. They said: "I was walking through the town centre and at first sight, I thought it was someone who had collapsed, but as I got nearer, it became clearer it was a dog. I advised the owner to get the underbelly and paws of the dog submerged in cool water and then move her into the nearby metro where it was air-conditioned. "I went into Primark and asked one of the staff members if we could get the dog into their door entrance so she could have half a chance of survival. With that, the staff member spoke to the manager who was amazing and assisted to get a trolley and load the dog on so the dog could be transported back to the owner's flat. "The reason I filmed it was because this needs to be shared to highlight how quickly dogs can get to a critical stage.   "Sadly, this wasn’t an isolated incident - although it was the most severe I have witnessed." Other overheated pups made headlines this week, as the UK saw record-breaking temperatures as well as Red warnings in places. For instance, a Golden Retriever was treated for heat exhaustion and stretchered off the Mournes walk by a mountain rescue team, in Ireland, on Monday.
