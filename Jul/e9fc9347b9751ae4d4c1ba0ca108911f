Thousands of staff represented by train drivers’ union Aslef, the TSSA and the RMT could walk out over pay, conditions and job security. There are growing concerns it could lead to the first national train drivers’ strike since 1995. Aslef is balloting drivers at 10 train companies over pay, jobs and conditions. Staff at three firms have backed action so far. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: “We believe (strikes) will have a massive effect. There will be a summer of disruption.”  And more than 6,000 TSSA staff at Network Rail have also been balloted for strikes in a dispute over pay, conditions and job security, with July 25 the earliest date for a walkout. More than 300 members of the TSSA at CrossCountry and East Midlands Railway voted overwhelmingly for action, it was revealed yesterday. Royal Mail managers are to strike later this month in a row over jobs and pay. The Unite union said 2,400 managers will work to rule on July 15-19, followed by strikes on July 20-22.
