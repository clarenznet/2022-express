Abbey Clancy, 36, looked amazing as she posed in a jaw-dropping cut-out swimsuit during her family holidays in Portugal. The model has been enjoying some time off while soaking up the sun with her husband Peter Crouch and their children. In a new series of pictures shared on Instagram, Abbey posed up a storm in a geometrical print one-sleeved swimsuit. She styled the look with some dark sunglasses as she flaunted her slender figure and taut abs, while putting her peachy bum on full display in one very cheeky pic.
