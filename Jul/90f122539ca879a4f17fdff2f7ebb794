Clapping is banned in the House of Commons, with MPs expected to signal their approval with loud cheers. However, since the turn of the 21st century, there has been one exception to that rule: when a Prime Minister finishes their last ever PMQs. It was a touching gesture first made by David Cameron to Sir Tony Blair as he left office. The then opposition Conservative leader urged his colleagues to stand up and applaud the Prime Minister as he left the chamber for the final time. Labour then returned the favour when Mr Cameron bowed out of the top job in 2016 and when Theresa May stood down in 2019. Gordon Brown would likely have received a similar end to his time at the helm had it not been for the fact he was forced out in a general election.

Glum-faced, they sat and watched on as Tory MPs said goodbye to their leader and thanked him with applause. Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns even appeared to be in tears. Labour's lack of respect came despite the Prime Minister fitting in a huge swathe of achievements in his short tenure in Downing Street. He finally freed the UK from the clutches of the EU, led Britain's fight against the Covid pandemic, and stood up to the barbarism of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. The only parting note from Labour came at the very start of PMQs.  Sir Keir admitted that the relationship between a Prime Minister and leader of the opposition was "never easy", adding: "This one has proved no exception to the rule." He said he wished Mr Johnson well in whatever he did after office. "I would like to take this opportunity to wish him, his wife, and his family the best for the future," he said in a bog standard, dull statement. Hardly a fitting tribute to the man who is set to be remembered as one of Britain's most iconic Prime Ministers.
