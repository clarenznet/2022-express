Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas stunned her fans at the TRIC Awards this evening. The 61-year-old looked incredible in a black jumpsuit with a very daring plunging neckline. Shirley paired the stylish number with a white blazer and black platform sandals. She looked decades younger than her years as she smiled and posed for the cameras with actor boyfriend Danny, 48, who she has been dating since 2019. Strictly Come Dancing scooped the Best Reality Show gong at the awards ceremony which celebrates the best of TV and radio.
