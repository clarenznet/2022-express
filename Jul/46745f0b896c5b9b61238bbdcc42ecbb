Kate Moss, 48, looked younger than ever last night as she hosted an event to mark her new Diet Coke ‘Love What You Love’ campaign. The supermodel, who has recently been appointed the new role, flaunted her ageless looks in a leopard print shirt. Kate looked fantastic as she DJ’d at the party, which took place at London’s 180 The Strand, where she unveiled four new limited-edition can designs. She also posed for a series of pictures alongside the new can designs, which were inspired by some of her most iconic looks.
