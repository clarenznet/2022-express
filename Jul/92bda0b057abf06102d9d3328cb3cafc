Kyrgios boldly flouted Wimbledon's all-white dress code before and after his fourth-round victory over Brandon Nakashima. The Australian walked onto Centre Court wearing red Jordan trainers, then changed into them again, along with a red cap, once he had completed his five-set win against the American. Kyrgios has already been fined twice this tournament for his on-court conduct and is likely to face further scolding for breaching rules which state white must be worn "from the point at which the player enters the court surround". Commenting on the rule breach, he said: "It's more attention for me. What's that saying? Any publicity is good publicity, right? I sit here now in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon again and I just know there's so many people that are so upset. It's a good feeling." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
