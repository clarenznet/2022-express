Yaroslav Kardash, of Lviv's Farmers Association, said: "People have less possibility to buy things. We don't have the market to sell. The prices are higher." As well as damaging up to Â£170billion of the country's infrastructure, the war has caused farmland manpower shortages. Farmers are having to borrow neighbours' equipment to reduce the impact of their losses. Ukraine, the "bread basket of Europe", was one of the world's largest exporters for wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Boris Johnson previously refused to rule out UK troops helping to lift the country's export blockade - and Mr Kardash says Poland is also keen to help. He said: "They want to ensure the traffic of it through Poland and can transit through to the countries in Africa and Asia in need. "Now there is talk of the building of grain terminals on the Polish side to keep the grain safe."
