Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes enjoyed a resurgence at the British Grand Prix with the team looking almost back to their best. Hamilton looked as if he could challenge for the win on newer tyres before a late safety car neutralised the pack. He took advantage of Charles Leclerc’s older tyres to sweep around the outside of Stowe and take a record-breaking 13th podium at Silverstone. However, it was a weekend to forget for Max Verstappen after the Dutchman dropped down the field. He suffered an early puncture after running through a piece of debris and then struggled to make up ground in the midfield. But, Leclerc’s fourth-placed finish stopped the Monegasque from doing serious damage in the championship fight, meaning Verstappen still leads the standings by 34 points from Sergio Perez. Leclerc is a further nine points back and 43 behind Verstappen.
