Buckingham Palace confirmed they had carried out a private investigation into complaints Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, had bullied members of staff, claims she has always strongly denied. The investigation was privately funded by a senior royal, thought to be the Queen and looked at how palace staff had handled the complaints rather than the allegations themselves.  Calling the allegations “defamatory”, a source told Us Weekly that the Duchess and Prince Harry are looking forward to leaving them behind. The source was quoted saying: “Meghan is a fair boss and never bullied anyone who worked for her at the Palace in the first place. “She’s happy that her name has been cleared from the defamatory claims.” They added: “She and Harry are looking forward to putting the incident behind them and are happily moving on with their lives in Montecito.” The Palace didn’t release details on the investigation, with a senior palace source attributing this to the confidentiality of the discussions.

The investigation was launched in March 2021, and the palace said at the time that changes would be shared. Royal expert Katie Nicholl, suggested the reason the Palace chose not to publicly release the results is that Queen Elizabeth II “doesn’t want any more drama.” DON'T MISS: Harry 'now regrets' huge Meghan Markle gamble as fears for PrincePalace urged to publish probe into claims Meghan 'bullied' staffSussexes looking into 'cleaning up' their social media footprint
