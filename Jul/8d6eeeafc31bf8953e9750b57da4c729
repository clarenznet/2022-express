In view of her 755,000 followers, the Eternal singer posted the throwback holiday snaps as she looked back longingly on the precious time spent with her sons. Louise penned: "Take us back… a few snaps from our Holiday… so grateful we got to go away before Chaz goes off to Uni Xxx." (sic) In one snap, Louise stunned in a knitted, crochet dress as she smiled for the camera with her sons Charley and Beau either side of her. The mother-of-two showcased her incredible figure and her perfect, sun-kissed complexion thanks to the sunny weather. She wore her highlighted treses in loose waves which fell casually over her shoulder. It comes as Louise prepares to bid farewell to her eldest son Charley as he heads off to University later in the year.
