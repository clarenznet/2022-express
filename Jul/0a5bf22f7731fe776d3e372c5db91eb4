Liz Hurley, 57, looked glamorous last night as she slipped into a fuchsia sequin-adorned dress. The model posed up a storm as she took to Instagram to share a video of her outfit with her 2.4 million Instagram followers, Liz donned the very low-cut gown, that put her cleavage on full display, as she made a series of poses in front of the camera. She opted for leaving her chestnut hair down, flaunting her natural waves as she accessorised her gown with a simple pendant necklace.
