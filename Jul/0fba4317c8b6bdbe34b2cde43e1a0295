Supermodel Linda Evangelista, 57, revealed yesterday that she had finally settled her lawsuit with Zeltiq Aesthetics after its fat-freezing procedure had left her "brutally disfigured" and "deformed". She told People magazine earlier this year that she had been living "in hiding and shame" and dreaded running into anyone she knew after her face and body drastically changed. The tearful star had told of how she once loved being on the catwalk as an international fashionista, but now could scarcely bear to go out at all. The Canadian, who was previously featured on over 700 magazine covers, had sued the company over its Coolsculpting procedure for $50 million. In her latest photo, she looked much more like her glamorous former self, fluttering her long lashes while a makeup artist applied liner to her lips. "It takes a village," she confided of her glamorous transformation, before adding the hashtag "#grateful".
