Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov threatened to "nuke" England but spare Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Solovyov also took aim at British Armed Forces chief Sir Tony Radakin for suggesting the Kremlin would pose a threat to the world for the next decade. The Russian state television host said: "Who did you beat and where, Admiral? "They have completely lost their minds … and now they’re lecturing us, the country (we can destroy with) one Sarmat." Sarmat RS-28 intercontinental ballistic missiles can travel at a whopping 15,000mph and have a destruction area of 250,000 square miles. They also have a range of 11,200 miles and have an explosive yield which is 50 times more powerful than Hiroshima.

Despite threatening to nuke England, Solovyov suggested the Celtic corners of the UK would be spared in such an attack. He said: "We won’t touch Scotland: Scotland will be independent. "Wales has been quiet so far. Wales, too, will be independent. "And at Biden’s request, Northern Ireland will unite with Ireland." Solovyov's comments came just weeks after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiled fresh plans to hold a second independence referendum in 2023. Away from nuclear threats, the Ministry of Defence has claimed Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled. A recent intelligence update revealed: "Russia has struggled to sustain effective offensive combat power since the start of the invasion and this problem is likely becoming increasingly acute."
