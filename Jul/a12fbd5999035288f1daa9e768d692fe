Legendary actress Natalie Portman, 41, flaunted a red strapless skater dress for the event, showcasing her long, lean legs, and donned red strappy heels to match. She was celebrating her return as Jane Foster, an astrophysicist with a secret superhero persona activated only when she has access to a mystical hammer. Natalie wore a crown of roses atop her head as she strode around taking advantage of photocall opportunities. The elegant star, who has previously taken on a diverse range of roles in movies such as Jackie and Black Swan, shone alongside her co-stars and her husband Benjamin Millepied, who'd come along for the ride. She was also seen pulling some expressive faces as she made her dramatic appearance at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square.
