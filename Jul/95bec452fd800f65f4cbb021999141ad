She said: “I was actually in Retford when I had a message telling me not to come home the usual way and that there had been some sort of fire. It’s awful and I just hope everyone will be okay.” Another resident said that the property on fire has “completely gone”. She said that she first spotted smoke at around 10.30am. A third resident of the street returned this afternoon after having been out all morning. She said: “I'd been at yoga and I had a message telling me there was a fire. It’s awful.
