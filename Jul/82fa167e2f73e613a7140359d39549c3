Hosting duties were instead taken by wine connoisseur Olly Smith, taking over for the BBC cooking show’s usual presenter Matt Tebbutt. He welcomed comedian Ed Gamble and a range of guests to show off their best recipes, but viewers may be wondering why Matt was unable to make it to the studio this week. Matt was absent from this week’s Saturday Kitchen due to his attendance at another event elsewhere. His co-presenter Olly led the programme this week, along with comedian Ed, Paul Ainsworth, Ravneet Gill, Paul A Young and Helen McGinn. Ed had to fight for the viewers’ affections in the hopes of avoiding his food hell of licorice and tucking into his food heaven, lobster rolls. But why was Saturday Kitchen’s usual host Matt unable to attend on Saturday morning?

The Saturday Kitchen presenter has been keeping his followers up-to-date with the event on social media. On Friday, Matt posted a selfie with the Royal Butler Grant Harrold from the event. He captioned the post: “Morecambe and Wise at the @internationalcheeseawards @the_royal_butler.”  He then added the hashtags: “#cheesy #eveningwine #morecambeandwise #foodheaven #theroyals #staffordshire @_lovecheese #cheese #theroyalbutler.” Fans tuning in on Saturday were impressed with how wine expert Olly handled his new role. @mrcadlupton tweeted: “Eh, Olly Smith is hosting and cooking on @SaturdayKitchen?!
