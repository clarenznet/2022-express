Heidi Klum, 49, appeared happy and proud alongside daughter Leni, as she took over the runway of the Dolce and Gabbana fashion show in Italy over the weekend. The star's lookalike daughter looked stunning as she joined her fellow models in Sicily on Saturday evening.  Heidi supported Leni on the night, sharing a series of photos documenting her daughter’s special moment as she followed in her footsteps as a catwalk star.  In one snap, the mum and daughter duo posed together.  Heidi got close to her daughter, who she shares with ex Flavio Briatore and Seal, who has adopted Leni, in a semi-sheer jumpsuit adorned in bright jewels, as the young model was dressed in a black corseted number.  "Good Luck my Baby," Heidi captioned the heartwarming photo.
