Russia expert Iver Neumann, a Norwegian political scientist, claimed several factors now point to the decline of Putin's dictatorial regime, including Western efforts to stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He told Radio Free Europe: "So, since Putin's tenure sort of began 22 years ago, very little, if anything, has really happened to the economy. "And I find it stunning that a trained Marxist like Putin simply doesn't grasp that material factors are of the essence. "His regime have done a thorough job of rooting out what there was of organised liberal thinking and work in Russia. Bad for the country, good for the Putin regime." The prediction comes despite Putin announcing that the Russian navy would receive hypersonic Zircon cruise missiles within the next few months. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
