The latest figures show that more than half of injury appeals (51.25 per cent) between April 2010 and March 2021 resulted in successful outcomes including a new award or increased support. Hannah Pearce, of the Royal British Legion (RBL) said: “We need decision makers to get claims right first time. Injured veterans and bereaved families are being forced to undertake unnecessarily stressful and lengthy processes as they challenge unfair decisions, adding insult to injury after serving their country.” The RBL is pushing for “urgent improvements” to the compensation scheme. Shadow armed forces minister Kevan Jones said: “These figures show that, time and time again, legitimate compensation claims made by our armed forces are being turned down by the Government they served. "Members of armed forces deserve to have their claims considered seriously in the first instance, not stretched out into a costly and stressful appeals process.” The scheme was also attacked by the charity Help for Heroes. A spokesman said: “We believe it is immoral that veterans already dealing with the burden of mental and physical wounds have to fight for what we believe is rightfully theirs... We know that some veterans are wrongly discharged from the armed forces without diagnosis of a mental or physical health condition, hindering their ability to claim compensation.”
