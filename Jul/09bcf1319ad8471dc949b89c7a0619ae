Heatwaves will be 30 percent more common due to the use of fossil fuels and other human activities, scientists say. This week gave a preview of typical summer weather in 2050, a team found. The study in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences looked at data from just over a year ago, when nearly 1,500 people died in the US and Canada as average temperatures more than doubled. Dr ChunzaiWang, of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, said: "We found it is likely global warming associated with greenhouse gasesâ€¦led to a more extreme heatwave event." "If appropriate measures are not taken, the probability of extreme heatwaves will increase and further impact the ecological balance, as well as sustainable social and economic development."
