Britney Spears, 40, looked amazing as she posed in a tiny floral bikini as she lounged on a large sailboat. She then shared a sultry video in view of her 41.8 million Instagram followers as she shared highlights from her idyllic boat trip. It included footage of the Toxic singer sunbathing topless, covering her assets with her hands. The highlight video also shared a clip of Britney getting on a private jet with her husband, Sam Asghari. She captioned the post: "It was all a dream !!! Hey but I’m still dreaming y’all !!!" (sic) This comes after the singer recently announced that she completed the long-awaited book that delves deep into her life, family and the years of her conservatorship.
