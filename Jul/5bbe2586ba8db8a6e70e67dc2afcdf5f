Dame Shirley Bassey, 85, looked utterly stunning at the Monaco Rose Ball tonight. Itâ€™s impossible to believe the songstress is in her eighties as she smiled for the cameras at the annual charity event. Shirley wore her hair in its trademark voluminous style, with shimmering gold eyeshadow and dramatic eyeliner. On her lips was a dash of red lipstick, and she wore glitzy dangling earrings. The star wore a stunning floral gown in pink and purple tones. Also present was Janet Jackson along with iconic fashion designer Christian Louboutin.
