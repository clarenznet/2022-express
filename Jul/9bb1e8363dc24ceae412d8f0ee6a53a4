Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea are all looking to get more deals over the line as Premier League clubs continue to do business. The new season begins in less than three weeks and teams are urgently making signings to strengthen their squads before the opening day. United are imminently set to add Lisandro Martinez to their squad and continue to push for the acquisition of Frenkie de Jong. Barcelona want to sell the player but a deal has still yet to get done despite Erik ten Hag's desire to get him through the door. Chelsea have signed Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly in the last seven days but want more new players, with Thomas Tuchel potentially set to sign two more central defenders. Manchester City's Nathan Ake will not be one of them, however. Arsenal are meanwhile set to bring in Oleksandr Zinchenko from City. The Premier League champions are trying to bring in Marc Cucurella from Brighton as the Ukrainian's successor, with Zinchenko heading to the Gunners for around Â£30million.
