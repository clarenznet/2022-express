The Daily Express is campaigning for more people to join the 27 million on the NHS Blood and Transplant Organ Donor Register. Data reveals that despite a 30 per cent increase in transplants in one year, 6,393 people are still waiting for one. In the last year 429 patients have died while waiting. Our campaign was sparked by the Meredith family, of Totnes, Devon, who are fighting for gravely-ill cystic fibrosis sufferer Sarah, 29, who has been waiting a year for a new liver. Mum Cathy said: “It is so important – for desperate patients like my amazingly brave daughter Sarah – that more people sign up to the register.” Meanwhile, Myles Tolley now plans to get married after receiving three life-saving liver transplants. The bank worker, 32, of Walsall in the West Midlands, explained: “During my second transplant I almost died, but thanks to the incredible medical team I’m like a different man. “A lot of my family and friends now understand how important organ donation is and have all joined the register.”
