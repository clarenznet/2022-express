The population in the United Kingdom has grown to the point that our NHS, housing, schools, prisons, etc just are not coping, says Dick Waring from Fareham, Hampshire. Our population is expanding to the point of collapse and still we allow migrants to come and stay. Where was this in the debate? We are in dire straits if the choice is Rishi Sunak or Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election. Liz Truss is not a good speaker but she gets things done. Actions speak louder than words. The Conservative Party will regret getting rid of Boris, says Raymond Bray from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. He was a popular prime minister because he got things done. He has had a lot to deal with; Brexit, Covid and now supporting Ukraine. He is a hero in Ukraine for his fast response in sending support. He was a prime minister who cared and I cannot see that in the other contenders.  Why all the fuss about the weather? asks Jane Turner from Axminster, Devon. In 1976 we lived in a wooden cottage in the countryside with heath fires raging. Our cottage was hosed down 24 hours a day and eventually we were evacuated. My daughter had her first birthday at the time and I still tease her about having a dozen firefighters at her birthday party. I think Ann Widdecombe is out of touch saying that Camilla is widely loved and respected, says Ron Jobes from Newcastle upon Tyne. She is never going to be accepted by the majority of people no matter how much the media portray her as a suitable future Queen.   Count me in with Ashley Smith (Letters, July 20), in wishing a quick recovery to the health of the very funny man that is Rhod Gilbert, says Chris Highland from Northampton. I often think of Rhodâ€™s observation about his budget airline trip when he found that when he reached the carousel in arrivals, all he could find of his case was the actual handle with an airline tag attached. Get well soon good fellow.
