The Princess Royal beamed as she stepped out at the Great Yorkshire Showground. Princess Anne looked stylish in a trilby hat as the sun shone during the event's 163rd year at Harrogate Showground in north Yorkshire. She teamed the look with a brown dress and smart cream jacket. This is not Priness Anne's first time at the Great Yorkshire Show. She visited in 2014 and 2018 - carrying on the tradition of a Royal Family member to regularly visit the Yorkshire event since its very first show in 1838. Charles Mills, director of The Great Yorkshire Show, said he was honoured to have the Queen's daughter in attendance. He said: "We are honoured that Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal will be visiting The Great Yorkshire Show and I shall be proud to accompany her throughout. "This will be a very special year for The Shorthorn Breed and what better way to mark the anniversary than with a visit from their patron and wonderful Royal visitor."
