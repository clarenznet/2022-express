Nick Knowles, 59, beamed from ear to ear as he held hands with his girlfriend Katie Dadzie, 32 as they went to watch the men’s final. The DIY SOS presenter looked smart in a blue shirt with a navy jacket. Meanwhile, Katie dressed for the heatwave wearing a blue sleeveless cotton dress to coordinate with her beau. She showed off her endless legs by wearing nude espadrille wedges and accessorised with gold bracelets. Nick was first seen enjoying a romantic meal in London with Katie over the Easter weekend. The couple looked happy as they embraced during a cigarette break outside Hakkasan restaurant in Mayfair. They were then pictured strolling hand-in-hand as they browsed the cars in the Bentley showroom before jumping in a taxi together to head home. Despite an age gap of 28 years, the couple looked more in love than ever when they were first seen out together in public.
