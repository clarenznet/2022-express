Tom Cruise, 60, looked phenomenal as he headed for a night out in London’s Mayfair after his movie, Top Gun: Maverick surpassed $600 million at the international box office. The movie star looked elegant in an all-black ensemble as he posed for the cameras outside the Dorchester Hotel. Tom opted for a crushed velvet polo shirt showcasing his muscular arms, which he combined with some black trousers. The actor paired the outfit with some faded black boots and accessorised his look with a black watch.
