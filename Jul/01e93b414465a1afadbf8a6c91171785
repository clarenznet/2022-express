SIX weeks of holiday childcare may cost working parents nearly £500 more per child than for the same time in term, a report says today. Parents pay around £148 a week for holiday childcare - five percent more than 2021 - and £67 typically charged by an after-school club, said charity Coram Family and Childcare. A family paying nearly £890 for six weeks of holiday care spends about £400 in term time. The report said holiday care "is a social and economic resource for the country, providing employers with a reliable workforce and making sure that children are safe, well fed and taking part in positive and fun activities". The findings on costs for pupils aged four to 14 are based on surveys from local authorities. The report highlights the patchy availability of care in rural areas and for disabled children. Ellen Broome, charity managing director, said many parents have no choice but to be kept out of work or struggle to pay for basic necessities.
