Christie Brinkley appeared sprightly as she hosted the annual Polo Hamptons Match and Cocktail Party on Saturday which was held in Bridgehampton, New York. The model showed off her toned legs as she made the most of the sunshine. She wore a yellow and orange patterned dress, while adding an extra touch of class to her already elegant look with a pair of beige sandals. The actress accessorised her outfit with a necklace, silver watch and carried a multicoloured basket. Her blonde hair fell down naturally onto her shoulders as it blended in with her outfit.
