Ant McPartlin looked heartbroken today as he pulled his presenting partner Declan Donnelly in for a hug. Dec is laying his brother Dermott to rest today, after his tragic death aged 55 from a mystery illness. It has been a bittersweet time for Britainâ€™s Got Talent host Dec, as he welcomed his second child with wife Ali Astall earlier this week. The couple had not made it publicly known that Ali was pregnant with the baby boy, named Jack Anthony Alphonsus. He was born just weeks after Father Fr Dermott Donnelly died after being rushed to hospital, his loved ones at his bedside.
