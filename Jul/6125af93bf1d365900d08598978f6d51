Stacey Solomon, 32, surprised fans earlier this week by sharing pictures alongside her older sister Samantha and her daughter, Poppy. The two sisters made the most of the good weather by arranging a playdate in the park for Poppy and Stacey’s baby daughter, Rose. The two cousins melted Stacey’s fans’ hearts as they posed for the camera wearing similar dresses and showcasing big smiles. Stacey has four children altogether - three sons and one daughter, and shares her two youngest with her fiancé, EastEnders actor Joe Swash.
