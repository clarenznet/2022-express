The Chase quizzer Jenny Ryan, 40, looked worlds away from her alter-ego "The Vixen" as she rocked blonde locks instead of her signature dark tresses. The ITV favourite sported her stylish glasses which she teamed with a long black dress and open-toe sandals. The stylish ensemble was accessorised with a statement necklace as she carried a burgundy bag. The quizmaster was all smiles as she headed to the press night for Sister Act musical press night held on Wednesday.
