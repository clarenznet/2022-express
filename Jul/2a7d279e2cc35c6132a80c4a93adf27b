Tom Cruise, 59, has stepped out to attend the British Summer Time music festival in Hyde Park looking young and fresh shortly ahead of the Hollywood megastar’s milestone 60th birthday tomorrow. The Top Gun star's sprightly appearance comes after he split from his Mission: Impossible 7 co-star Hayley Atwell last month. Tom was spotted with a mystery woman in a pink Gucci cardigan at the gig after his split from Hayley. The actor went for a casual look to watch Adele perform, sporting a navy blue suede jacket and matching polo tee. He wore casual blue jeans and chunky black boots to finish, as he was seen mingling with fans in Hyde Park. Since leaving the Top Gun star, Hayley has reportedly started dating self-styled “vegetarian pagan” Ned Wolfgang-Kelly. The two were pictured looking cosy together on Hayley’s Instagram following her split from Tom.
