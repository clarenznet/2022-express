Tommy Cimato, who has 16 years' experience in the trade, stressed it is unhygienic for passengers to expose their legs during the flight. He said tourists "never know how clean" the seat will be so suggested trousers as an appopriate alternative. Jetsetters, though, typically opt for shorts on a plane due to increased levels of comfort, he told Mirror Online. "Don’t or try not to wear shorts when you're on an airplane," Mr Cimato said. "It's the same thing as the window – you never know how clean it's going to be, so if you have pants, you're going to have less germs. He added that tourists will rarely be aware which parts of aircraft have been cleaned more thoroughly than others. It's for the same reason he also warned tourists who fall asleep on aeroplanes to avoid resting their head on the windows.   The flight attendant said: "You are not the only one that has done that and you don't know how many people or children have wiped their hands or other things all over the window." And the travel expert warned tourists to never press the flush button loos on aircraft. Mr Cimato was blunt in his description of it, calling it "pretty gross". He said: "Do not ever touch the flush button with your bare hands. It's honestly just super unsanitary and pretty gross, so when you flush, use a napkin or tissue that's in the lavatory." Deanna Castro, who has also worked as a flight attendant for around 15 years, said tourists should always step into their row to let other passengers pass when they board planes. She told InsideHook: "When boarding, it’s polite to step into your row and allow other passengers to pass behind you. "It’s okay to take a few extra minutes to get ready, but please step into the aisle and wait for a lull in traffic."
