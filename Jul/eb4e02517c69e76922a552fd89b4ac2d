Catherine David, of WRAP, said: "It's devastating to see how much food continues to be wasted from supply chains when so many people are struggling to afford the basics, and food redistributors say they can take more. "Whilst we welcome the increased amount of food being redistributed in the UK, we know there is a huge amount of good food - 200,000 tonnes of it every year - that could be feeding people. "Wasting food feeds climate change, as all the resources taken to produce the food are also thrown in the bin." There was a 16 percent increase in surplus food redistribution in 2021, meaning more than 106,000 tonnes of surplus food - the equivalent of 253 million meals - were dished out through charitable and commercial outlets.  Last year, charities handled six times more surplus food than in 2015. Food minister Victoria Prentis said: "Nobody wants to see good food go to waste. "Our Food Waste Prevention Programme has provided 300 grants totalling almost Â£12million since 2018. "Food is a personal and political priority for me."
