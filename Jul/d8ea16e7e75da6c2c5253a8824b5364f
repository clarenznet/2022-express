Overnight between Thursday, June 23 and Friday, June 24, the three dogs were roaming freely in the grounds of a property when they were said to have been targeted, Suffolk Live reports. Their owner found the animals unconscious the following morning. Tests confirmed the three dogs had ingested Pentobarbital, which is an anaesthetic used for sedation and euthanasia in cats and dogs and only available on prescription. Officers say the exact method of transmission is unknown, but it is thought the dogs were fed food laced with the drug. While it is not known why the dogs were poisoned, officers think it is likely to be the actions of would-be thieves. Sgt Brian Calver, from Suffolk Constabulary, said: “This is a particularly worrying incident. Criminals will go to great lengths to steal other people’s property but this is simply disgusting and wicked. The dogs involved have all made a recovery but only by early intervention and good fortune. "This could easily have resulted in the dogs' deaths, which is something we don’t want to see anybody suffer. With that in mind, we’d urge anybody that does allow dogs to wander free at night to reconsider their security arrangements and ensure the dogs are kept safe and secure.” Anyone with any information is asked to contact Suffolk Constabulary online or by calling 101 quoting incident 37/39683/22. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. According to the RSPCA, owners should follow the following steps in the event of suspected poisoning: Information on the RSPCA website states: "While you're waiting for the vet, don't attempt to treat or medicate dogs yourself. Some medicines for humans and other animals may be poisonous to dogs. "Never attempt to make dogs vomit. Don't use salt water as it's extremely dangerous. If the skin or fur is contaminated, wash with a mild shampoo and water, then rinse well and dry. "Keep dogs away from other animals to avoid cross-contamination."
