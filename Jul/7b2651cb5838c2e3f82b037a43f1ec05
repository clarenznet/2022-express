Crime fiction lover Camilla, 74, told hosts Rav Wilding and Michelle Ackerley: "I love Crimewatch. I was always amazed by how many crimes were actually solved." Rav told her the TV show was back in October, joking: "And now we'll know you will be watching." Charles, 73, and Camilla were visiting BBC Wales' Cardiff base to launch public tours of the building. There, Camilla met domestic abuse campaigner Rachel Williams, who inspired her to highlight violence against women. Rachel told her: "Please keep doing what you are doing, you are such an advocate." The couple also visited Cardiff's statue of Wales' first black headteacher, Betty Campbell, who died in 2017, and chatted to her family. Later, Charles pulled a pint in The Lion pub in Treorchy, in the Rhondda Valley, and tried Thunderbird beer at craft brew shop 2Dudes.
