James and Sandy Easdale, 50 and 54, were new entries in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, with their fortune, estimated at £1.3billion, made through transport and property. The pair were both directors at Rangers, where the team was welcomed onto the pitch to Turner classic The Best. They are now looking into buying the rights to some of her songs. Rangers reached the Europa cup final this year before winning the Scottish Cup so "the timing felt right for celebration," a source close to the brothers said. They said: "The brothers miss the energy of Ibrox and 3pm on a Saturday. "Tina Turner's classic song The Best has long been a Rangers anthem, the song greets the players as they step onto the hallowed turf every week. "So they decided to check if they could snap up the purchase of rights to some of Turner's most famous hits." They are in talks with One Media, which has certain rights to a number of master recordings by Ike and Tina Turner.  The brother said in a statement: "Our enquiries are based on an emotional connection to the singer and football but as always business comes first for us, these rights are a good buy given the recent activity in the music rights sector. "Negotiations are continuing and we are optimistic that a fair deal for all parties concerned can be struck." Ray Santilli, who is negotiating the sale, said: "This could be a really smart purchase for the brothers. "During discussions I've been really impressed by the Easdale's musical knowledge and their passion for Tina Turner's cultural legacy." Michael Infante, chief executive of One Media, said: “One Media is always happy to share in national successes and we know Scotland can be proud of Rangers this season. I understand the Easdale brothers looking to mark the success in this way. “We look forward to us all examining a sales deal that will help mark Rangers’ achievements this season.”
