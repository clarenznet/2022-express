The Jamaican-born champion of black British theatre played Blossom Jackson in the BBC soap and Auntie Susu in Channel 4’s Desmond’s. Mona, who died on Monday, was made an OBE in 2005. And in 2018 she won a Women of the World lifetime achievement award after founding the Talawa company to champion black British theatre. Her six-decade long TV, film and stage career included a first leading role as Lady Macbeth in Peter Coe’s 1970 African version of the play. Aside from EastEnders, in which she played the matriarch of the Jackson family from 1994 to 1997, Mona had roles in The Sweeney, Casualty and Coronation Street. Former EastEnders star Cheryl Fergison (Heather Trott), called her an “inspiration”. Loose Women host Charlene White described Mona as “a trailblazer in every way”.
