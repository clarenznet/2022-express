Max Verstappen took another huge step towards retaining his Drivers' Championship crown by securing yet another race victory at the French Grand Prix. The Dutchman was gifted a huge opportunity to claim a maximum haul of points and duly delivered to pull clear at the top of the standings ahead of of Charles Leclerc, who crashed out after making a crucial mistake while in the lead. Leclerc, who started from pole position, managed to keep Verstappen at bay for the entirety of his involvement in the contest before spinning out and skidding into the barriers in another cruel blow to his hopes of clinching the end-of-season honours. His Red Bull rival went on to cruise to victory without looking back after putting in a near-faultless performance around the twists and turns of Circuit Paul Ricard. Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, was able to rubber-stamp his best result of the year by coming home in second place to mark a brilliant weekend for Mercedes. He was joined on the podium by George Russell, who forced his way ahead of Sergio Perez during the closing stages of the race before surviving a late push from the Mexican driver on the final lap.
