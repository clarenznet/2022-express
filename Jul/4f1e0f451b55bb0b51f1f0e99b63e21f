The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) secured the "liability" order at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. The former Villa player did not attend the hearing to contest the move or send legal representation, reports Birmingham Live. The CMS application stated: "Complaint for a liability order of child support and enforcement fee totalling £44,904.80 for the period unknown. "In accordance with section 33 of the Child Support Act 1991." The ex-player cannot be named due to a reporting restriction which prohibits publishing anything which could lead to the child in the case being identified. District Judge Smith granted the order in his absence at the court. Matthew Wheeler, from the CMS, said the case was one of many as part of a "bulk application" to the court. Mr Wheeler confirmed that all of the defendants had been properly notified of the application by 1st Class post at least seven days prior to Friday's hearing. He said: "Each defendant is liable to make payments of child maintenance and have failed to make one or more payments. Those payments have still not been paid in full." The more children a person has with a former partner the more child maintenance they will need to pay. Maintenance payments can be arranged with the former partner in what is known as a "family-based arrangement". These arrangements are not legally binding, therefore it is important that both parties trust each other. However, they do offer the flexibility to meet any changing needs and circumstances. Child support payments can also be calculated by the Child Maintenance Service if the parties cannot agree.
