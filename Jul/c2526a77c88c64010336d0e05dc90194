Princess Charlotte and the rest of the Cambridge children are fashion icons in their own right, and their outfits regularly sell out after royal outings. But one colour Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge tend to turn to time and again for their children's wardrobe is blue, and it is thought the Cambridges dress in the colour frequently to show they are a "cohesive unit". Karen Haller, Behavioural Colour Psychology and author of The Little Book of Colour, previously told MyLondon: "Wearing the same hue when the Cambridges are showing they are coming together as a family, representing themselves as a cohesive unit. "When it comes to colour psychology, darker blues communicates you are in a position of authority, trustworthy, reliable and can be depended on. "You have a sense of duty and take that seriously with committed focus. "There is also an adverse side to blue and that is you can come across as aloof and distant so they don’t want to inadvertently create the feeling that they are unapproachable."
