Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, spoke out after visiting the port city on the Black Sea. He wrote on Twitter: "Two days after I depart the city it’s attacked. As I said in my previous tweet - you cannot trust Russia. "Baffled by how the international community was bluffed by Russia’s plan to re-open the port. More courage & leadership please from the West to help Odesa." It comes as Russia missiles struck Ukrainian port city Odesa just hoursafter a landmark food supply deal hit a grain facility, Kyiv stated. The deal to unblock crucial grain exports stuck at three ports, including Odesa, was signed yesterday in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote via Telegram: "This proves only one thing: no matter what Russia says and promises, it will find ways not to implement it."
