Kyiv said the shelling was relentless, with missiles hitting the cities of Bakhmut, Kramatorsk, Chasiv Yar, Sloviansk and Kostiantynivka, as well as surrounding villages. A spokesman said: "The operational situation in the region is that continuous shelling is underway all over the front line. "It's a reminder that Russian invaders are continuously shelling the Donetsk region, killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure." Russian forces also struck port infrastructure in the southern Mykolaiv region. Nevertheless, Kyiv yesterday announced it could restart grain exports "in days." An agreement was reached in Turkey last week to allow safe passage for the millions of tons of grain stuck in silos in southern Ukraine. A day after the deal was signed, Russia had launched two rockets into the Black Sea port of Odesa, but Ukrainian authorities said they now believed they may once again be able to start shipping out the grain. Under the agreement, a safe passage will be established, with signed assurances that Russia will not attack ships sailing through it.
