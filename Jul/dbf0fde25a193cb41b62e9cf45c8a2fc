There's a series of mandatory worker benefits for employees working in the UK. One of the most important benefits is access to state pension after retirement. Employers are legally required to enrol employees into an appropriate pensions scheme. The company must also contribute at least eight percent of 'qualifying earnings'. These payments will be stored in an overall pot, which you'll have access to once you reach state pension age. All workers are also eligible for holiday pay or paid annual leave. Everyone that works a five-day week is allowed a minimum of 28 days' holiday - although most companies reward workers with more holiday days. It's also required for employers to offer sick pay to employees. There's a minimum level Statutory Sick Pay which is set by the government. But most companies offer contractual sick pay. You'll likely be offered 14 days of full pay sick leave, before moving to reduced payments. Expectant mothers will be offered statutory maternity leave of 52 weeks. Of course, you don't have to use the full 52 weeks, but you must take two weeks' leave after your baby is born. Don't forget that you won't have to pay for healthcare in the UK, either. The NHS is a government-funded healthcare system, which is paid through income tax. You'll be able to freely visit a doctor at your local GP surgery, or head to hospital without paying a penny. Emergency help from paramedics is also free, including any ambulance transportation to hospital.
