Caroline Henry, who is Nottinghamshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner, exceeded the 30mph speed limit on several occasions - including once travelling at 40mph - but appeared in court today and pleaded exceptional hardship to keep her licence. The court was told 52-year-old Henry, who is responsible for holding Nottinghamshire Police to account and overseeing its spending, will struggle to get around with her family on public transport. But District Judge Leo Pyle imposed the driving ban at Nottingham Magistrates' Court today. Speaking outside court, Henry said: "I am truly sorry for speeding. Quite properly I have been fined and banned from driving for six months. I remain committed to serving the people of Nottinghamshire as Police and Crime Commissioner. Thank you for listening to me on this hot day." She didn't, however, respond to reporters' questions, including "Are you not going to resign?" and "Are you getting the bus home?". The mum was elected as a Conservative commissioner in May 2021, reports Nottinghamshire Live.  The court heard some of the speeding offences happened before Henry became the county's Police and Crime Commissioner, and others occurred since she came into the role. The defendant, from Giltbrook, Nottinghamshire, has to travel frequently for her children and the court was told why these trips could not be done by public transport. Her five speeding offences happened from March to June 2021. The court previously heard an automatic camera recorded Henry travelling at 35mph in a 30mph zone in Chilwell, near Olympia Sports Centre, on March 17, 2021, at 2.56pm. She also exceeded a 30mph speed limit a day after on March 18, 2021, at 10.33am, on the A610 in Nuthall Road between Stockhill Lane and Bar Lane. The speed was recorded at 40mph.
