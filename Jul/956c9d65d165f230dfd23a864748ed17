Amazon is giving customers a great incentive ahead of Prime Day next week. This shopping bonanza is one of Amazon's biggest annual sales, with this year's event scheduled for Tuesday July 12 and Wednesday July 13. And ahead of the price cuts, which are exclusively for Prime customers, Amazon is giving away £10 worth of credit to spend for free. This offer is running till the end of the month and gives Amazon Prime subscribers free credit when they use the Amazon Photos app for the first time. Amazon Prime customers simply need to back-up at least one photo - which is free - on the Amazon Photos app for the first time to get the credit. After doing this they'll get an email from Amazon within seven days confirming whether the free credit has been applied to the account and how to use the promotional code. If you want to take advantage of the deal then simply click here to head to the page for the offer on Amazon.co.uk. Before doing that though, there are a few important things to point out about the Ts and Cs for this deal. The credit you receive can only be used on products that have a minimum price of £30. And the offer is also only available on products sold by Amazon on the Amazon UK website. So you won't be able to use the voucher alongside products from the Amazon Warehouse or from third-party marketplace sellers, even if the order is 'fulfilled by Amazon' or you can get Prime delivery with it. If this all sounds good to you and you get an Amazon free voucher just bear in mind the promotional code runs out on August 15 2022. For anyone that isn't aware, Amazon Photos is one of the many perks of having an Amazon Prime membership. Prime subscribers can take advantage of the service at no extra cost, and will get unlimited full resolution photo storage as well as 5GB storage for videos. If you have some treasured photos or videos you don't want to lose then Amazon Photos is a great way to keep these files perfectly safe in the cloud.
