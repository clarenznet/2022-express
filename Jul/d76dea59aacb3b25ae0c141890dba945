Unions have announced strikes throughout July, with action spanning several days as they withhold services to negotiate better conditions for their workers. The cost of living crisis has forced many of them down this track, with pay failing to keep up with inflation, which analysts expected could hit 11 percent this year. Some services will face delays or cancellations over the next few weeks as several unions vote for their workforces to withdraw.  The RMT voted for strike action last month over three days and two weeks, covering June 21, 23, and 25. In July, the union has not ruled out further action, as negotiations over pay and conditions in transport offices across the country continue. The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has made a similar pledge, and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) is holding a ballot. Ballots don't close until July 11, so there are no official dates for this month's train strikes if they go ahead.
