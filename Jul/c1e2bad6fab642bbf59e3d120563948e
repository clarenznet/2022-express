West Ham are in advanced talks with Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca over a transfer from Sassuolo. The 23-year-old has previously been linked with a move to Arsenal before the Gunners signed Gabriel Jesus. Hammers boss David Moyes has been desperate to upgrade his forward line during the transfer window. They finally appear to have found some competition from Michail Antonio after agreeing a deal with Sassuolo. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta was desperate to sign a new forward but eventually landed top target Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. That left West Ham with a free run at Scamacca. It has been a successful transfer window for West Ham so far despite missing out on former player Jesse Lingard to Nottingham Forest following a last-minute U-turn. Moyes seems set to continue bringing players in having been given strong backing by the clubâ€™s board to strengthen his squad.

The Serbian was part of the Eintracht Frankfurt side that knocked West Ham out of the Europa League last season. Lille midfielder Amadou Onana has also been linked with a transfer to West Ham. The 20-year-old Belgian enjoyed a breakthrough campaign in Ligue 1 last term and is wanted by some of Europe's top clubs. It comes as Moyes continues to do business. Midfielder Flynn Downes and defender Nayef Aguerd have already arrived and Moyes will hope to conclude more business. However, former Manchester United star Lingard will not be re-joining the club following his positive loan spell in 2020-21. The England international had initially given his word to West Ham that he would sign but has instead decided to join Forest after being offered more money.
