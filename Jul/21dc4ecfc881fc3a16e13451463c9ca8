In an interview with Palace Confidential, Rebecca English claimed the Royal Family want to "keep the peace" with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Ms English said: "There’s been a suggestion made to me that the palace have really done this because they don’t want to poke the bear that is Harry and Meghan." She continued: "I suspect the Palace are willing to take a flurry of bad headlines and television reports on the chin over the next few days in the hope that after that, the whole issue will quietly wither away." "I’ve never been at a briefing in my 20-plus years of reporting experience where something has been so comprehensively swept under the carpet."
