Glamorous Jennifer Aniston, best known for her world-famous role as Rachel in Friends, clutched the brim of her straw hat as she looked into the camera. A sandy beach beckoned behind her as she posed for the shot, her tousled hair caressing her shoulders. "THAT BEACH HAIR!" @lolavie, the official Instagram account for Jennifer's haircare brand, exclaimed. Jennifer scarcely posts a selfie, and has just 98 posts on her own account in spite of boasting 40.6 million followers. However, despite her often keeping a low profile on social media, over a million delighted followers pressed like on her latest post within a matter of hours.
