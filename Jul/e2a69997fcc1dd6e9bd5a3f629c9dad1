Five-year-old Karlton Noah Donaghey, was found unconscious on the floor of his home in Dunston, Gateshead, by panic-stricken mum Lisa. He had a helium-filled dinosaur balloon over his head.  After a neighbour tried to revive Karlton, he was airlifted to hospital in Newcastle, where he spent six days on a ventilator in intensive care. Karlton began to suffer seizures and doctors told Lisa, 43, and his dad, Karl, 35, there was nothing more that could be done. He died on June 29. The youngster had bought the balloon on his first visit to The Hoppings, a popular travelling funfair that visits Newcastle's Town Moor every year. Heartbroken Lisa said: "He loved dinosaurs. The balloon was the same size as him and I think he's put himself inside it to be a dinosaur."
