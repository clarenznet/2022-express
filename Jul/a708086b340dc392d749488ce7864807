BBC viewers were divided over the tense thriller with the use of flashbacks being criticised. @spotthefrogs remarked: “Absolutely none of this is believable #TheControlRoom.” @llcoolj40 agreed: “#thecontrolroom @bbctv Sorry but I'm giving up on this after 20 mins. Too many flashbacks already. “It is obviously going to be a totally unbelievable plot wrapped up with pointless emotional issues.” “Anyone struggling with this? I’m so confused #TheControlRoom,” @samtheaspie questioned. @ASuperGav wrote: “Remember when dramas had a beginning, a middle and an end instead of confusing flashbacks?#thecontrolroom.” However, some viewers felt they were hooked on the “confusing” twists. @Sanassee tweeted: “I’m so confused but I will be watching more. #TheControlRoom.” DON'T MISSHow many episodes are in The Control Room? [INSIGHT]Death in Paradise spin-off location unveiled by Kris Marshall  [INTERVIEW]How many seasons was Gentleman Jack supposed to be?  [INSIGHT] @DeCaesteckerFan agreed: “The twists! I'm hooked. #TheControlRoom.” The BBC thriller continues on Monday and concludes on Tuesday evening. Ahead of the drama’s premiere, Iain opened up to Den of Geek about his new role. He said: “From the very start, I don’t think his life’s good and he’s cheerily plodding along and then this terrible thing just grabs him by the neck. “He’s already not getting any enjoyment out of life, he doesn’t invest in relationships, he doesn’t even have one with his dad. “He is completely self-reliant and anonymous, by choice. “You have to ask yourself, what has happened to someone to make them like that?” The Control Room continues on BBC One on Monday at 9pm.
