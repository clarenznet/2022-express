Queen Letizia looked stunning in Madrid for her latest appearance. The Spanish monarch brought in summer with a pink patterned dress. This is dependent on the size of the ring and the material it is made from - with availability in sterling silver, gold-plated silver and solid gold. As for hair and makeup, the monarch went for simplistic chic. She wore her dark tresses down in her traditional style. She wore a flutter of mascara, bronze eyeshadow and a shimmery pink lip gloss.
