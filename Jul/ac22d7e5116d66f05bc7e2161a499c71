The Beckham family are enjoying a £1.6m-a-week yacht break and young couple Cruz and Tana, both 17, were spotted cosying up on the vessel earlier this week. Cruz was seen looking comfortable in a black tracksuit while model Tana wore a matching grey set. Cruz's parents David and Victoria are thought to have invited Tana to join them on board. She and Cruz met earlier this year and a source recently told The Sun that he's smitten. The insider revealed: "Cruz and Tana met at the start of the year and have been quietly dating for a few weeks. "They make a really lovely couple and she is down-to-earth and really fun. “She is not fazed by Cruz’s fame and where he comes from. "It is early days but Cruz seems smitten with Tana.”
