Elections take place across the UK at least every two years, ranging from general elections to local elections. Like all democratic countries, there are strict rules about who's eligible to vote. For parliamentary elections, you'll need to be at least 18 years old, and either a British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a Republic of Ireland citizen. That means you won't be able to vote in general elections if you're a Ukraine citizen. Local elections eligibility is slightly different, however, and varies depending on which country you're living in. In England and Northern Ireland, the rules are exactly the same as general elections, except EU citizens living in the UK can vote, meaning you still won't be able to have a vote. But Scotland and Wales local elections are open to everyone aged 16 and over, as well as all legal resident foreign nationals. So, if you're residing in Scotland or Wales, you'll be able to vote in local elections. You might also be living in the UK during a referendum, which is very different to elections. Examples of referendums include the Scottish independence vote in 2014, and the Brexit vote in 2016. Each referendum has its own rules and eligibility, so it's difficult to say exactly whether you'd be able to vote. But, as a general rule of thumb, you'll likely need to be a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen, which means Ukrainians wouldn't be eligible to vote.
