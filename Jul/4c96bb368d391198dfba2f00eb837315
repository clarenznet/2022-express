Fleming was an ageing host of Country Matters, an afternoon television programme about life in the English countryside, who had a terrible cough that often rendered him speechless. He was one of the few characters to appear throughout the four year run of the Nineties sketch show that made Higson and Gone Fishing host Paul Whitehouse, both 64, comedy stars. During a recent special guest appearance at the Theakston Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate, for which the Daily and Sunday Express are media partners, Higson was asked if he watched his friend Whitehouse and Bob Mortimer in Gone Fishing. He said: “Oh yes, it’s lovely. I actually went up to their Christmas special last year. I went up and we did a bit where they meet Bob Fleming on the riverbank fishing, and it was great fun but the BBC said they had to cut it out because of Covid. “They said it’s disrespectful of anyone who had lost a relative because of the coughing, but I don’t know.”
