Kimberley Garner put on a leggy display as she stepped out in Capri, Italy, yesterday. The former Made in Chelsea star, 31, dazzled in the tan and black coloured dress which perfectly complimented her sun-kissed complexion. Thanks to the garment's daring split, the star showcased one of her toned pins. The model accessorised with an ornate silver necklace and matching cuff, as well as diamond rings and glitzy heels. She wore her highlighted blonde tresses in soft waves which fell around her face.
