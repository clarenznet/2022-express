We’re over halfway through the 60th anniversary year of the James Bond film franchise and there's still no news on who will replace Daniel Craig as 007. Nevertheless, the bookies’ odds continue to have their movements and the latest shake-up has seen a Marvel star’s chances halved. According to Coral, Eternals MCU star Richard Madden has seen his odds slashed from 7-1 to 7-2. A spokesman for the bookies said: “There has been strong support for Richard Madden in our next James Bond betting over the last 24 hours.

He’s never been shy about how he’d love to take up the Licence To Kill next, although perhaps he’s too famous now. After all, Cavill has starred in a number of different spy films already, playing a CIA agent in The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Bond producer Barbara Broccoli has said that production on the 007 reboot won’t begin for at least two years, so take these odds with a pinch of salt, but you never know…
