Max Campbell, 10, handed out invites to all of his 31 classmates ahead of the end-of-term celebration without asking his parents. When his mum Diane, 50, received a text from another child's parent showing a photograph of the invitation days before the party, she discovered what Max had done and swiftly cancelled the event altogether. But the mum of three, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, was mortified her son was able to conjure the plan. Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Diane said:Â Max told me he'd found the invitation cards in my card box from when he had a birthday party before and had filled them out without me knowing. "He said he wanted an end of term party because Year Six get one - going from primary to secondary school - and he doesn't. Nobody turned up, thanks to Facebook, although the neighbours and friends did joke that they were going to gate crash the party with wine and beer. "It's a big school and there are still loads of parents I haven't even met or spoken to." Diane, who is a professional DJ and singer, used Facebook to contact all the parents and inform the event wasn't going to happen. She added: "My friend messaged me to tell me that her son was excited to come to Max's party. "I messaged her back and said 'what party?!' She told me Max had invited everyone from his class to an end of school party. I had to make a status on Facebook asking people to message me because I had no idea how many invites he'd given out. "I'm thankful we have Facebook, otherwise I'd have had 31 kids at my door on Monday afternoon."
