After telling Egypt its vital grain supply was safe – despite Kremlin rockets hitting Ukrainian export hub Odesa – Vladimir Putin’s mouthpiece abroad flew to Oyo in northern Congo, stronghold of its President Denis Sassou Nguesso. The pair greeted each other before talks, then Lavrov travelled to Uganda and Ethiopia to try and shore up support for Russia’s invasion. The foreign ministry in Moscow accused the US of attempting to persuade African leaders not to pose for pictures with Lavrov, “to prevent Russia from using this as proof that it’s not isolated”. Lavrov said Russia had had “good relations with Africa since the days of the Soviet Union”, adding it “provided assistance to the national liberation movement, and then to the restoration of independent states”. In Cairo he had met President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and his counterpart Sameh Shoukry, saying Egyptian officials urged “a political and diplomatic” settlement to the conflict.
