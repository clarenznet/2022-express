Jennifer Lopez, 53, proved age was just a number when she took to stage in Capri last night. The singer stunned in a sultry transparent thong bodysuit, showcasing her killer curves. Jennifer joined the stage with a large frilly coat on but ditched it to reveal the tiny nude mesh number. She wore her brunette tresses parted in the middle as they fell effortlessly down her back. Jennifer recently returned from her honeymoon in Paris after marrying fellow Hollywood star Ben Affleck.
