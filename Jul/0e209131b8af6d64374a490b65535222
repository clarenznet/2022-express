Victoria Beckham has dazzled as she shared behind-the-scenes snaps of her time spent with Vogue Australia. Victoria, 48, told her 30 million Instagram followers: "@vogueaustralia behind the scenes, head to @tiktok for an exclusive look!" In the first snap, the mother-of-four stunned as she donned a glitzy, sequined top which she paired with a long, A-line skirt. The second showed the fashion guru dressed in a layered white dress which hugged her curves in all the right places as an assistant attended to the garment. Victoria flashed a hint of her toned midriff as she donned a top made out of length of black discs which had been teamed with a voluminous skirt. The last pic showcased the star's amazing figure in a pair of wet-look leggings and a tiny, black crop top.
