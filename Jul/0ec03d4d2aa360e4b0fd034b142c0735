Spaghetti hoops are also off the menu for 29 percent of children today. And 34 percent have never even savoured the classic ham, egg and chips combination. Of 1,500 mums and dads polled, nearly a quarter claim they would not dream of feeding their kids beans on toast or bangers and mash. Half of parents say their children have a far more refined and varied diet than they did at their age. Today's young diners are more likely to be eating salmon with tenderstem broccoli (49 percent) than classic stodgy British tummy fillers. Even kids' snacks are healthier, with nearly 60 percent choosing cherry tomatoes and mangoes while middle class staples avocado (49 percent), hummus (44 percent) and olives (31 percent) are also popular, said theV&Me poll. Founder Mulu Sun said: "The survey clearly shows children now have more sophisticated taste buds than previous generations and parents' attitudes towards feeding children are changing." More than half (54 percent) of parents prefer their children not to have a fizzy drink with their dinner while 39 percent would rarely offer sugary cereals for breakfast. Children are also used to risotto (29 percent) and dairyfree ice cream (29 percent). And some parents will not even dish up pizza or chocolate (both 18 percent) or even a jam sandwich (17 percent). Nearly two thirds (64 percent) of parents revealed they always try to feed their little one's healthy food instead of less nutritious junk meals. And 78 percent are keen to give their kids a wide variety.
