Former Strictly Come Dancing professional Brendan Cole, 46, informed fans that he will undergo a painful double hernia operation today. The dancer asked his followers to “wish him luck” as he spent some time alone before his surgery. Nevertheless, Brendan seemed to be in good spirits as he shared a very cheeky snap of himself wearing his backless hospital gown. He didn’t tie the gown up all the way which left his full behind on display. Brendan then jovially wrote in the caption: “Cheeky!!! 4 months overdue…Double hernia operation today. “Feeling a little ‘all by myself’ but enjoying the alone time by taking this backside mirror selfie. Wish me luck!” READ MORE:Dolly Parton's 'emotional affair' left her considering suicide  Brendan added an ice skate emoji, hinting that his hernia was caused from an injury sustained during his time on Dancing on Ice.
