Laila Rouass, 51, has been working on her tan as she holidays in Morocco. The Footballers’ Wives star stunned in a selfie wearing a black bikini and her hair styled in a sleek bun. Laila was inundated with comments from her amazed fans, including Shelina who said: “Damn girl!” Dave echoed: “Stunning!” And Sarah added: “You will be forever gorgeous.” Via her Instagram Story, Laila also shared a photo from lunch with her friends. She later sunbathed on the beach while she read a book and ate watermelon.
