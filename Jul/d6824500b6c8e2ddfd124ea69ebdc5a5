Sophie, Countess of Wessex joined Prince Charles and Camilla tonight at the opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games. The Countess stunned in a Galvan London emerald turtle neck dress. The emerald colour perfectly suited Sophie's gorgeous blonde hair. Both Sophie Wessex and Prince Edward were watching the opening ceremony in Birmingham. Sophie last wore this high-neck emerald green dress in 2020 for a film premiere. The film premiere was for Sulphur and White in February 2020.

Sophie Wessex's 'awful' Jimmy Choo shoes are critiqued This was paired with beaming red lipstick for a bold look. The Countess had also accessorised with a simple white bracelet. As the pictures of Sophie were taken when she was sitting in the audience, it is unclear what shoes the Countess wore to the opening ceremony. However back in 2020 when she last wore this Galvan London dress, she paired it with some beige suede heel shoes. She had also tied her hair into a bun, instead of curling it and wearing it down like she did on Thursday evening. Royal fan @Suzanne_Brmptn tweeted: "Sophie looks absolutely stunning tonight."
