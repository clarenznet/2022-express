The DJ, 67 - who has fronted Steve Wright In The Afternoon on the station since 1999 - announced the news on air on Friday that Beeb bosses were scrapping his show. He will be replaced in the autumn by Radio One's Scott Mills, 49. One well-placed industry source said deep-pocketed rivals such as Virgin or Global - whose stations include Heart, Capital, LBC and Smooth - would mull a potential approach. The source said: "Steve would be a very attractive proposition to many. He would bring a ready-made audience." And funnyman John, 55, hinted signing his pal would be a big coup for a rival station. He said: "Steve Wright is one of the greatest broadcasters we have ever produced. "He has always been incredibly supportive of me and appearing on his show was always a great delight. A radio station somewhere is about to sign a big star." It comes as BBC presenters Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel recently penned a deal with Global.Andrew Marr has also signed to the company, while Virgin lured ex-Radio Two stars Graham Norton and Chris Evans. However, BBC insiders are buoyed that Wright is to continue with his popular Sunday Love Songs show, as well as seasonal specials.  Publicly, Steve has said he is "staying" at the BBC. The insider added: "Yes, it's all change but Steve is a key part of the future and is committed to the station." Yesterday it was revealed Radio One star Chris Stark is joining Global to present Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp. A BBC spokeswoman said: "We're delighted Steve will continue to present his hugely popular Sunday Love Songs show as well as Christmas and Easter specials for Radio 2, and Serious Jockin' series for Radio 2 and BBC Sounds."
