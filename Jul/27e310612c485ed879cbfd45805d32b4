Novak Djokovic has become Wimbledon champion for the seventh time of his career after defeating Nick Kyrgios 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3) on Centre Court. The Serbian was forced to come from behind after dropping the opening set but kept his cool to win the next three and get his hands on yet another Wimbledon trophy.  Djokovic was the big favourite to land the title after another strong fortnight at SW19 but got off to a slow start as he was broken in his third service game. And he was unable to topple the Kyrgios serve in the opening set as the Australian got the upper hand. Djokovic started the second set strongly and raced to a 4-1 lead, before seeing it out 6-3. The pair then went toe-to-toe in the early stages of the third set but, with the score at 4-6 6-3 4-4, Djokovic finally turned the match on its head as he broke Kyrgios before holding serve to go two sets to one ahead. Kyrgios refused to buckle and held every one of his service games in the fourth set. But Djokovic made the most of his experience to take the tiebreak 7-3 and secure victory under the sweltering London heat. And after the match Djokovic paid tribute to his opponent. “Nick - you'll be back, not just in Wimbledon but in finals,” the 37-year-old told Sue Barker o Centre Court. “I know it's tough to find consolation words after a tough loss like this but you showed you deserve to be the best in the world especially on this surface after this tournament - I wish you all the best. “I really respect you a lot, you are an amazing talent and now everything is starting to come together for you. I never thought I would say so many nice things about you considering the relationship. Okay, it's officially a bromance.” Express Sport provided live game-by-game updates from the 2022 men's Wimbledon final which you can recap below.
