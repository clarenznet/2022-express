The Duchess of Cambridge's sister has welcomed a little girl with her banker husband James Matthews. The Daily Mail's diary editor Richard Eden said Kate's father confirmed the happy news after he bumped into him yesterday in Pret a Manger near Kensington Palace. Pippa and James are already parents to Arthur, three, and Grace, one. The couple, who tied the knot in 2017, have not yet revealed the name of their new arrival. Mother-of-three Kate will no doubt be delighted to have another niece. The Middletons are known to be a close-knit family. It comes as the Cambridges are understood to be moving to Windsor this summer with their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis The move means Kate will be closer to her parents Carole and Michael, who live in Bucklebury. They will also be near the Queen who has been mainly based at Windsor Castle since the Covid pandemic. William and Kate are said to be relocating from Kensington Palace, which will remain their London residence, to Adelaide Cottage in Berkshire. A source previously told the Sun: “Kate and William were very keen for a modest home to start their new lives in Windsor. "Adelaide Cottage fits the bill because it is a four-bedroom home and they do not need any more as they have no live-in staff. "They were adamant they didn’t want anything too showy or anything that needed renovating or extra security so as not to be a burden on the taxpayer. “The added bonus is they can send George, Charlotte and Louis to school together locally. "They had no other demands than a pleasant family home close to schools and the Queen.” Meanwhile, Pippa and James have reportedly bought a £15 million home just 20 minutes from Carole and Michael. A friend told the Daily Mail earlier this month: "Pippa and her family are thrilled. "It’s a very exciting time in their lives. "They are looking forward to living closer to her parents."
