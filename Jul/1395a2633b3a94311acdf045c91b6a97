Lorenzo Sonego has clearly not fully forgiven Rafael Nadal after their spat on Centre Court last weekend, insisting the Spaniard "distracted me". Nadal got into an uncharacteristic feisty exchange with Sonego at the net during their fourth-round match on Saturday. Nadal came out on top with ease, winning 6-1 6-2 6-4, but there was a brief moment in the second set which grabbed the attentions of everyone. The 22-time Grand Slam champion is usually reserved on the court when it comes to making any complaints. It's a rare occasion for anyone to get under his skin, but Sonego did just that and Nadal called his opponent to the net to request he tones down his grunts during points. At the time, Sonego had broken Nadal but after the exchange he was immediately broken back and went on to lose the match. And Sonego has now come out fighting, insisting Nadal was wrong to do what he did. “A player should not call his opponent on the net,” Sonego said afterwards.

He distracted me.” Nadal did admit in his post-match press conference that he had made a mistake and apologised to the Italian. "Well, first of all, I have to say that I was wrong," he said. "Probably I will not -- I should not call him on the net. So apologise for that. DON'T MISS  "My mistake in that. No problem. I recognise that. Then after that, all the stuff during the match that I don't want to comment, because is something that I spoke with him in the locker room and it stays there. "Only thing I can say is I saw him personally. I apologise for that. My intention was never to bother him at all. "Just to tell one thing that was bothering me that I think he was doing in that moment, but that's it. I think there is some codes between players. Yeah, we had some issues there. But that's it."
