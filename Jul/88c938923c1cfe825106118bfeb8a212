On deciding the time had come to announce his departure, he ensured Cabinet vacancies were filled before writing a word of his resignation speech. That was vital to thwart a push by enemies to deny him his final days. He needed to show he could head a functioning administration to run the country until the selection of his successor is concluded. Sure enough, within minutes of his statement outside No10, hostile Tory MPs and grandees were baying for his instant replacement by an interim Premier. They are likely to be disappointed. Our unwritten constitution has no provision for a “caretaker” PM, no mechanism for removing a Premier who has relinquished the leadership and set a timetable for their departure. Rebels will rapidly find little appetite for a renewal of this week’s chaos now the Prime Minister has agreed to go. Pressure is falling on officers of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers to accelerate the leadership contest. Rounds to pick two final candidates are almost certain to be rushed to a conclusion in the next fortnight. If a frontrunner emerges, the trailing candidate should expect pressure to stand down, to avoid lengthy hustings and a ballot of party members. Thus, a PM could be in place by the start of Parliament’s summer break. In any case, potential candidates have little time to get campaigns running. That should favour frontrunners such as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss who have been quietly putting teams into place and raising campaign funds. Mr Johnson’s opponents will doubtless brand him a “lame duck”. But he will want to use his final days to secure his legacy, particularly the full break with the EU. He knows Remainers are emboldened – with arch-Europhile Lord Heseltine declaring “When Boris goes, Brexit goes” – and are desperate to undo his work. Mr Johnson got Brexit done and will want to leave office having done his utmost to make sure it stays done.
