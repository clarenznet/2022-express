Officers demanded European-style riot gear as buildings were set alight and a stolen milk float was driven at police lines. The violence came amid record youth unemployment and a breakdown of trust between the black community and the police over stop-andsearch tactics. 103 years ago (1919) The British airship the R34 made the first east-to-west aerial crossing of the Atlantic, just weeks after the first transatlantic aeroplane flight. The 643ft-long craft took off from the RAF East Fortune air base in Scotland and landed at Mineola on Long Island, after a journey of some four-and-a-half days and with virtually no fuel left. 70 years ago (1952) London's last tram made its final journey from Woolwich to New Cross, where it was met by London Transport Executive chairman Lord Charles Latham. The first electric trams had appeared on the streets of the capital in 1901 but by the 1940s they were regarded as outdated and dangerous and were gradually withdrawn.
