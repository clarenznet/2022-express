We're less than two weeks from the start of the 2022-23 Premier League season and top-flight clubs are still going all out to sign transfer targets. Manchester United and Chelsea are both looking to conclude big deals soon as the Frenkie de Jong and Jules Kounde sagas rumble on, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo's uncertain future. United have long had a deal in place to sign De Jong from Barcelona but the midfielder is digging his heels in and may prefer a move to Chelsea, who are also monitoring his situation. The Blues, however, are currently entangled in a transfer saga of their own with Barcelona set to hijack their deal for Sevilla defender Kounde. Chelsea now could look elsewhere with Presnel Kimpembe thought to be up high on their list while Denzel Dumfries is also being targeted.Â Elsewhere, Manchester City want Brighton's Marc Cucurella while Tottenham boss Antonio Conte is dreaming of signing Nicolo Zaniolo. The likes of Newcastle, Arsenal and West Ham are also expected to be busy over the coming weeks and are working on a number of deals. Liverpool are more focused on outgoings and could be done for the window but if this summer has taught us anything, it is to expect the unexpected. FOLLOW EXPRESS SPORT'S LIVE UPDATES BELOW...
