Isla Traquair, 42, claimed she suffered “panic attacks” and “nightmares” as well as spending a fortune on security because she was stalked. Jonathan Barrett, 53, allegedly stared at her through a window as she was about to undress, chainsawed a bush and walked into her kitchen to “make me a sandwich”. His alleged antics began soon after the ex-ITV News and Channel 5 host moved in to an 18th century cottage at Kingsdown, Wilts. Ms Traquair said she became terrified of “weird” Barrett after he started throwing stones during the night at her bedroom window, Salisbury Magistrates’ Court heard. She said: “He has been terrorising me. It has affected every part of my life. I can’t live in my home, I had to stay with friends.”   Ms Traquair said she left the house when “I became aware of banging upstairs on the exterior wall – I don’t know if a ladder was involved, it was traumatic”. Barrett has denied stalking her from March to September last year. She had returned to Britain from America to be near her ill mum who lives close by. The hearing continues.
