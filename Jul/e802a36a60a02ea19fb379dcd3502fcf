The actor, 61, who played the Prime Minister in hit Christmas film Love Actually, looked contemplative as he watched a match alongside his wife, Anna Elisabet Eberstein. Hugh looked dapper in a light grey suit which he paired with a crisp, whie shirt and dark trousers. His wife of four years looked glamorous in a navy dress with white polka dots and a large collar. It comes as the award-winning actor is facing calls from fans to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister following a spate of Tory resignations in the past 24 hours.
