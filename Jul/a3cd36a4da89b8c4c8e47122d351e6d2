Dr Mohammed Munnavar believes coronavirus is the most terrifying illness he has ever seen. He has urged people to keep taking the virus seriously after a surge in infections at Royal Preston Hospital in Preston, Lancashire. Dr Munavvar has warned the number of patients in hospital with the virus is soaring to similar levels to the height of the first wave in April 2020.  Royal Preston Hospital admitted 180 patients with Covid, many of whom were critically ill. He has said the number of infected patients at his hospital shot up by 80 percent in just a month. Speaking to The Mirror, Dr Munavvar said that June to July involved a significant spike. The number of patients had gone from 20 to 162 with two-thirds of those not fully vaccinated.

"There is a very clear correlation between whether a patient is vaccinated and the degree of severity with Covid. "Some people require oxygen but are not seriously ill. "But we have had one patient in critical care. "The rapid rise of patients means in the next few days we could be very close to hitting that peak or surpassing it."
