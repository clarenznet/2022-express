Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland are tied at the front of the leaderboard ahead of the final day of action at The Open. McIlroy is hunting his first Major win since 2014 while Hovland has never previously finished higher than 12th.  The pair have scored -14 over the first three rounds at St Andrews. The closest challengers are Cameron Smith and Cameron Young, who are both four shots behind. Tiger Woods failed to make the cut on Friday and broke down in tears as he waved farewell to the Scottish crowd for what could be the final time of his career. But all eyes have now turned to McIlroy and Hovland on the Old Course, and Express Sport has all the updates in what is set to be an exciting final round.
