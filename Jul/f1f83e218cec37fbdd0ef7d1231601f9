Purchased by Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert, Balmoral in Scotland has remained a beloved royal residence for centuries. Throughout her seven-decade reign, the Queen has spent her summers hiking around the Highlands before returning to her beloved main Scottish base of Balmoral Castle. And judging by the pictures of this beautiful Scottish estate, it isn't hard to see why the Queen and Royal Family return to it every year without fail.
