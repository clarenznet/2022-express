The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has agreed to strike on the 18th and 20th of August at seven train operating companies in a dispute over pay, job security and working conditions. Thousands of railway workers will walk out at Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, LNER, and Southeastern. This comes as millions of Britons are warned not to travel on Wednesday, July 27 as 40,000 members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers will go on strike after talks following the biggest rail walkouts in 30 years failed over three days in June. Network rail said that only 20 percent of services will run and some places will have no trains at all.
