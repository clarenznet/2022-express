Kate Beckinsale, 48, showed off her enviable figure as she took to Instagram to share her antics with her 5.4 million followers. The Hollywood actress put on a leggy display as she lay on her side in a garden feeding a fox. She sported a pink mini skirt, teamed with a white tight-fitted t-shirt and a matching blazer. The t-shirt included a rather explicit message, reading: "F**k you you f*****g f**k." (sic) Kate siamarly posted another video Sunday as she sported jeans and another expletive slogan white t-shirt. She was again feeding a fox in the garden, as she showed off her incredible figure while shielding the sun with large bug-style sunglasses.
