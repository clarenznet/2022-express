Bear Grylls, 48, and his wife of 22 years, Shara Grylls put on a glamorous display as they attended the Wimbledon Men’s final today. The adventurer looked dapper in a navy blue suit with a white shirt and green tie. Shara also looked glamorous in a red and blue patterned maxi dress while protecting her eyes from UV rays with large sunglasses. The couple tied the knot in 2000 and started marriage counselling from the off, with Bear explaining it was to stop things "breaking in the first place". However, their newly-wedding bliss came to a devastating halt just months later when Shara's father died, followed by Bear's dad Sir Michael Grylls only 12 weeks later. And Bear later admitted that the shock and grief of the double blow almost broke his marriage to Shara. "I didn’t really have a job - and that was a worry - and then her father died. Twelve weeks later my father died," he once told The Times. “We were living on this rusty barge on the Thames and the boiler was broken. I felt overwhelmed. I couldn’t talk to Shara because I felt I had to be strong for her.”
