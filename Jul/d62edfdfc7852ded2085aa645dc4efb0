Amanda Holden, 51, put her toned body on display as she posed for a picture in a bikini during her trip to Greece. The Britain’s Got Talent judge teased she was having a “tough day” as she relaxed on a boat near the beach. Amanda’s blue bikini matched her beach cover-up and her scrunchie as she looked into the horizon and soaked up the sun. She shared the picture in view of her 1.8 million Instagram followers today after her last update of a similar bikini snap four days ago.
