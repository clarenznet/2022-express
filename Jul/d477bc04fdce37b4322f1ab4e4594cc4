Rod Stewart’s wife, Penny Lancaster, 51, showed off her impossibly long legs as she shared pictures of her holidays with fans. The Loose Women star appeared in great spirits as she posed with an inflatable ring around her waist in Malibu while wearing a black slip dress. She also put her toned pins on display in a separate snap, shared to her Instagram story, that showed her smiling alongside a friend. The blonde bombshell looked chic in a black off the shoulder dress that she paired with gold jewellery and a matching black and gold shoulder bag.
