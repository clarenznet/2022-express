West Midlands Mayor Andy Street fears strikes could bring the region's transport network to a halt. He said: "Four and a half years in the planning could be threatened by this. The objective is a Games for everybody. "We are ready to deliver on that promise, with free public transport as part of that offer." "I would urge all rail workers to protect the Games and pay their part in what will be a wonderful celebration for the West Midlands, the country and the Commonwealth." Mr Street's concerns were echoed by Nadine Dorries, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, who said: "The West Midlands is proud and excited to be hosting the Commonwealth Games 2022." "It is shameful the unions are trying to sabotage them." "It would be a huge shame if strike action spoiled this moment for local residents and attendees at a time when the whole country should be coming together to celebrate the best in sport." Solihull MP Julian Knight said: "It's awful to think that after years of planning the Commonwealth Games could be so badly damaged by these unnecessary rail strikes." "My heart not only goes out to fans but to volunteers too." A planned union ballot involves members working for West Midlands Trains, which runs services between the towns and cities of the West Midlands and local trains within Birmingham itself. The results of the vote will be announced tomorrow, and legislation requires a two-week delay before industrial action begins. So strikes could start on July 25. The Games, which begin on July 28, have cost £778million, with £594million coming from central Government. Spectators will be encouraged to take trains to venues. Union Aslef said it hopes rail companies will negotiate agreements that allow strike action to be avoided. General Secretary Mick Whelan said: "Strike action is always the last resort for this trade union. But many of our members have not had a pay rise since 2019.
