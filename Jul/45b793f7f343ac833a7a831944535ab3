Liverpudlian pair Paddy Pimblett and Molly McCann both again secured superb victories at London's UFC Fight Night at the O2 arena on Saturday. McCann got the party started as a flying elbow helped her see off her opponent Hannah Goldy. And Pimblett continued to send the crowd wild as he forced a submission by choking out Jordan Leavitt. Speaking following his win, Pimblett said: "This is how I get down boy. Once again, I'm disappointed in my performance, I was firing on all cylinders in the back but that was s**t. "That's what I always do, I'm very good at it. I love every person in this crowd." He later went on to emotionally dedicate his win to a friend who had sadly lost their life recently. He added: "I woke up to news before the weigh ins that my mate killed himself. Please let's get rid of the stigma and men start talking." RECAP ALL THE ACTION FROM FIGHT NIGHT BELOW...
