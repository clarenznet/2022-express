The RSPCA says some owners of exotic pets are finding them too expensive to keep in heated tanks - which can cost Â£500 a year each. Snakes, including pythons and boa constrictors, have already been left beside roads in towns in Manchester and Hertfordshire. North Yorkshire Police are also investigating after three Royal Pythons were abandoned in Scarborough. Two were discovered in a bin outside a primary school, with pupils seen trying to take selfies with the creatures. And a third was found on a patch of grass after slithering its way past shops, pubs and a supermarket. Wildlife crime officer PC Graham Bilton said: "It is concerning three large nonnative snakes appear to have been abandoned with no consideration for their welfare." The RSPCA revealed three more snakes had been ditched in a pillow case in Hertfordshire. The 9ft boa constrictor, 5ft carpet python and 6ft reticulated python were left outside a reptile shop in Potters Bar. RSPCA inspector Mitchell Smith said: "Fortunately they're all healthy. But whatever situation someone finds themselves in, abandoning an animal like this is never okay.   "There is no guarantee it will be found. If someone is struggling to cope, there are lots of organisations who can help." Less than a week ago, another Royal Python was spotted in woodland near homes in the village of Knowl Hill, near Maidenhead. The RSPCA warned: "We are braced for a surge in abandonments once higher electricity bills start landing on people's doormats. "The majority of exotic pets require a carefully controlled environment, including 24-hour light and heating. Many of these animals can live for decades, making this a very long-term responsibility for an exotic pet keeper."
