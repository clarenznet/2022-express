The Duchess of Sussex's estranged father celebrated his 78th birthday on Monday. But Meghan did not make contact with Mr Markle, according to the Daily Mail's diary editor Richard Eden. Mr Eden tweeted: "Sadly, his son, Thomas Markle Jr, has confirmed that Meghan did not make contact with her father on his birthday." The Sussexes were in New York on Mr Markle's birthday where Harry spoke at the UN General Assembly to mark Nelson Mandela International Day. Mr Eden blasted the Duke for "burnishing his right-on credentials" rather than taking Archie and Lilibet to see the 78-year-old. The royal commentator said on Tuesday: "Happy birthday to Thomas Markle, who celebrates his 78th birthday today. "Wouldn't it be kind if Meghan took Prince Harry and their children to meet her father for the first time? "Instead, Harry is burnishing his right-on credentials by preaching at the United Nations." Meghan has been estranged from Mr Markle, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, since he pulled out of her and Harry's royal wedding citing health issues. Days earlier it emerged he had staged paparazzi pictures in the run-up to the big day. READ MORE:Â Royal POLL: Should Meghan Markle reconcile with her father?
