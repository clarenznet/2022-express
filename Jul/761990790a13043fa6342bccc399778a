The unprecedented move by the UK's largest airport is likely to ruin holiday plans for thousands of families. The 100,000 maximum number will apply from July 12 until September 11, during which time airlines were due to operate flights with a collective capacity averaging 104,000 daily. Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said: "Over the past weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see service drop to a level that is unacceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations. "We are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets." Other airports were said to be considering following suit due to a staffing crisis.
