Carlos Sainz took the chequered flag ahead of Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton at the end of a hugely chaotic British Grand Prix that saw three drivers forced to retire after a terrifying first-lap crash. George Russell, Alex Albon and Guanyu Zhou were all involved in the scary incident, with the latter flipping over and skidding across the gravel trap before smashing into the barriers at high speed. Zhou needed to be helped out of the cockpit and was quickly taken to the medical centre for precautionary checks before he was discharged after being declared fit. The crash sparked a lengthy red-flag period that lasted for nearly an hour before the race was finally resumed with a standing start. The lead changed hands on a number of occasions, with Sainz initially holding Max Verstappen off the line at the restart. The Red Bull driver went on to suffer from a distinct lack of pace due to floor damage to open up a four-way scrap for victory between Sainz, Leclerc, Hamilton and Perez. It was pole-sitter Sainz who eventually came out on top ahead of Perez to register his maiden Grand Prix victory, with the Spaniard overtaking Leclerc after a late safety car restart following Esteban Ocon's on-track mechanical failure. Hamilton, meanwhile, was able to get on the podium after a thrilling battle with Leclerc, who was ultimately forced to settle for a fourth-placed finish.
