 Tasha Ghouri, 23, was born deaf and wears a cochlear implant. Before entering Love Island, Tasha was a model and dancer from Thirsk, North Yorkshire.   Her father Tarek slams the comments, he says: “It’s just shocking. There have been some horrific things." “It’s nasty and it’s unnecessary. It makes me stick to the stomach, actually." “The rest of our family and her friends all feel the same way. It isn’t nice for anybody to read that. So it is difficult." “I mean, you can kind of try and brush it off. Well, some of it just sits with you. It’s hard.” Tarek said before the filming started, the family were given social media training from ITV and was reassured that Tasha will receive all the necessary support when she leaves the Villa. However, Tarek has still issued a statement asking for kindness from the viewers. He has also  united all the families of the fellow contestants, who agree the trolling has been “abhorrent.”  Tarek added: “Don’t take it out on other people when their families, ­their grandmas, their mothers, ­they’re watching it." “And maybe people don’t think about that, the hate stuff, some of the horrible comments." “I don’t know what fuels people to even think like that and get so emotionally involved and attached to somebody else’s life. And they don’t even know them. It’s quite bizarre. We’ve got no place for hate comments because this show’s about love.”
