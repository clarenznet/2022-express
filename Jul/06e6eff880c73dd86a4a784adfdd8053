Last night, Queen and Adam Lambert performed their first of two shows in Bologna, Italy. Brian May, Roger Taylor and the singer surprised the audience with an Italian operatic classic, in a break from their tour set. After the concert, Brian posted on Instagram: “Thanks fans from the first night in Italy, Brian also posted: “THANK YOU, #Bologna Beauties !!! What an extraordinary night ! You know, this whole tour has been amazing - but I think on a passion and pure volume level, you guys last night were the ultimate ! Well, so far ! What will tonight bring ? Bless you all and thanks for the welcome !! Bit of string breaking tonight !!! Usually I’d swap guitars —- but not at THAT point !!! You know when ? Cheers ! Bri.” He also shared a video of the show's special moment with himself accompanying Lambert singing Nessun Dorma on the electric guitar. The almost 75-year-old captioned the video on his Instagram, paying tribute to the late Luciano Pavarotti, who died in 2007. Brian wrote: “A spontaneous gift to Bologna last night !!! So proud of Adam !!! I can see our dear departed friend Luciano smiling !! Let’s Rock tonight !!! Bri.” Queen fans will know that Brian and Roger performed Too Much Love Will Kill You back in 2003 on Pavarotti and Friends. Queen and Adam Lambert occasionally add songs like this as a one-off for particular concerts, including Elvis and Led Zeppelin covers.
