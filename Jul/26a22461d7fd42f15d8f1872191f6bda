Footage shows smoke billow from Reids Bar and its function room in Billericay, Essex, which was being used by children at the time. No one was hurt in the blaze but it has destroyed a significant section of the building. Jason Gould, station manager with Essex Fire and Rescue Service, told Essex Live: "When crews arrived, 50 per cent of the roof was completely alight and had started to collapse in places. "Firefighters worked incredibly hard in extremely hot conditions in a large building, measuring about 50 metres by 50 metres, to prevent the fire from spreading. "The bar/restaurant was not open at the time but crews have done a fantastic job to limit the damage as much as possible." Roads were closed as eight fire crews fought the blaze into the evening. They came from Billericay, Orsett, Basildon, Brentwood and other hubs in the county.  Reids, which is also a restaurant and entertainment venue, is assessing the extent of the damage. A spokesman said: "Reids Venue has had a major fire today. "The extent of the damage is unclear at the moment. "A member of staff will be contacting all parties that have booked to let them know in due course if their party will be able to go ahead. "Thank you for your understanding and co-operation." Councillor Andrew Schrader, Conservative Councillor for Billericay East on Basildon Borough Council, said: "Terrible news about Reid's. Hope nobody is hurt." When a massive fire tore through a restaurant and nightclub in Maidstone, Kent, witnesses described the "very sad" scenes. Mu Mu bar and nightclub burst into flames on July 13, 2021, just days before clubs reopened following restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Photos showed smoke billowing across the town and flames roaring from the roof.
