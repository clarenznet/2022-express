Ben Oliver was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years and eight months at the first televised sentencing in England and Wales. The footage was shown on the BBC, ITN, Sky News and was available online. The move to allow cameras in crown courts follows a 2020 law change delayed by the pandemic. News organisations can now ask to film sentencing but only the judge can be shown. Oliver, from Bexleyheath, south London, admitted the manslaughter in January 2021 of David Oliver, 74, in Mottingham, south-east London. He became "very angry" over allegations of historic sexual abuse against his bedbound grandad. The killer, who was convicted of rape at the age of 15, stabbed his grandad 28 times in the face and body. Judge Munro set out the defendant's troubled family background, autistic spectrum disorder and depression.
