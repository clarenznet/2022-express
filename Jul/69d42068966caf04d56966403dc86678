Britney Spears, 40, took to Instagram yesterday to share some very revealing snippets from her honeymoon. The Toxic hitmaker posed up a storm for the camera in the first video, in a blue printed bikini. The shot then changes to Britney walking towards the camera, after ditching her bikini top and cupping her cleavage to protect her modesty. Britney also shared another picturesque video in view of her 41.8 million followers, as the star and her husband Sam Asghari soaked up the sun on an island. In the romantic clip, the happy couple can be seen on a boat trip as they dance and pose together during their getaway. She cheekily captioned the video: "Playing the role of How To Lose A Guy In 10 days. "Am I obnoxious enough ??? Do you guys think it's real ????"
