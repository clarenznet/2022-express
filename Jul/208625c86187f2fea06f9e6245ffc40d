Katherine Jenkins, 42, could have passed for 20 years younger today as the starlet showed up for a piece of the centre court action on Wimbledon Day Five. The stunning Welsh singer stepped out in a pastel blue tea dress with cap sleeves and a floral pattern. Her pale blue shoes perfectly matched the hue of her dress, making for a dramatic effect. Despite her outfit being blue, her mood was anything but as the star was spotted smiling while talking to her husband, Andrew Levitas. The pair also took a moment to pose for photos with Wimbledon chairman Philip Brook and his wife, Gillian.
