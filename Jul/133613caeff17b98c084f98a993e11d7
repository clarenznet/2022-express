Kate Garraway, 55, attended the London premiere of the movie with her 12-year old son Billy earlier today, and both were kitted out with Thor-branded T-shirts for the occasion. The Good Morning Britain presenter grinned broadly, wearing her lilac suit jacket open to display her shirt, while her son stayed close to her side. She paired it with matching lilac trousers, plus a pair of bright white Dr Martens boots. The outing with Billy follows an emergency plea she issued to her fans on social media recently after leaving all of husband Derek Draper's medical supplies in the back of a taxi. Derek was severely ill back in early 2020 with coronavirus, and fell into a coma - and Kate previously revealed he remains so ill that if he was unaided for three days in a row, there would be a possibility he would die. Fortunately the supplies were soon returned to her and the drama seemed to have been firmly put behind her as she larked about with Billy on the red carpet.
