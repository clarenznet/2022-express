The late Elizabeth Taylor was in her early thirties when she wowed audiences with her role in the movie Cleopatra alongside Richard Burton. The film's story gives a historical account of Cleopatra's involvement with Caesar (played by Rex Harrison) and her rise to the throne in the first half of the film. It later showed her involvement with Mark Antony (played by Richard) following Caesar's death and her ultimate downfall in the second half of the film. In a series of unearthed photos, Elizabeth stunned in a variety of costumes which included a striking golden dress, an extraordinary cape, and a sculptural headdress decorated with snakes surrounding the sun, which was a tribute to the god Ra. The extraordinary costumes adorned by the late actress were accessorised with a variety of wigs and dramatic makeup.
