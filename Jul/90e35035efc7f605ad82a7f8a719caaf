Hannah Waddingham, 47, known for portraying Rebecca Welton in Ted Lasso, stunned on the red carpet in Hollywood as she attended the ESPY Awards on Wednesday night. The ceremony was held at the Dolby Theatre, best known for also hosting the Oscars.  The actress showed off her superb figure in a dark blue jumpsuit which featured a plunging neckline.  At the waistline, the outfit was secured with a belt, in order to draw attention to her trim figure.  She accessorised the outfit with a black cloth for contrast.  Finally, to finish the look, she opted for dangling gold earrings and wore her hair in a charming blonde coiff.
