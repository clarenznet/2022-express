The Matrix actor Keanu Reeves, 57, opted to merge casual accessories with a smart suit, as he stepped out at Silverstone today.  The Hollywood star has clearly embraced his hair going grey, as he rocked salt and pepper facial hair, which he paired with a retro-style red baseball cap.  Keanu didnâ€™t seem to want to be centre of attention at the British Grand Prix 2022, as he made his way to the Formula 1 VIP area to watch the action away from fans.  The Canadian star paired a loose-fitting suit, featuring a black blazer and matching trousers, with a classic black T-shirt underneath.  Keanu then completed his look with a pair of brown leather shoes, as he watched the race intently this afternoon.
