Princess Charlene, 44, was inside the Palais Princier in Monaco on Monday and got photographed by a royal fan. The Princess stunned in a Louis Vuitton sleeveless single-breasted black jacket. The jacket also features a thick cream belt across the centre of the item.  Charlene’s designer jacket costs a whopping £3,291.80. The description on the Louis Vuitton website says: “This is a contemporary take on a classic Sleeveless Single-Breasted Jacket silhouette. “Crafted from a linen-wool blend, the sharp tailoring is informed by menswear traditions, which is also referenced by an inside pocket. “The contrasting wool-silk Mikado collar can be styled in two ways, thanks to a Monogram canvas chin strap. “A must-have eyelet belt from the collection completes the style.” Charlene paired this designer jacket with a pair of cream oversized baggy trousers. These were finished off with some black stiletto heels. She could be seen carrying a pair of black sunglasses and was wearing a ring on her fourth finger, which was likely her wedding band.  Charlene styled her hair in its usual short blonde pixie cut. The pictures were posted on Instagram by royal fan @aramayis with the caption: “And finally I got to meet Princess Charlene of Monaco.” Royal fans took to social media to praise Charlene’s chic style.
