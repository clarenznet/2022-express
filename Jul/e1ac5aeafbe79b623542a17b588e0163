Brooklyn Beckham, 23, has added a new tattoo to his collection in honour of his wife, Nicola Peltz, 27. David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son has proudly flaunted a new inking of his partner’s surname in a new social media post. Nicola took to the social media platform to share a picture of her husband’s chest with the new tattoo on it, above an older Cupid tattoo. Brooklyn, who took Nicola’s surname after their wedding earlier this year, re-posted the snap in view of his 14.2 million followers.
