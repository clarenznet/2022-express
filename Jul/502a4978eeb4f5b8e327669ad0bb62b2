He played the photographer Keith Jennings, who meets a grisly end in the 1976 horror classic The Omen, and the suspicious valet and bodyguard Spicer Lovejoy in James Cameron’s Titanic in 1997. His other major films during a 60-year career included The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, Straw Dogs, Time Bandits and Star Trek.  Manchester-born Warner was the son of nursing home owner Herbert Warner and Ada Hattersley, an unmarried couple who split up when he was young and shunted him between homes and schools in an exhausting perpetual tug-of-war. Cinema and acting became his escape. Tall and imposing, with a long face, he won a place at Rada where John Hurt was a peer.He made his professional stage debut in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream at the Royal Court Theatre in 1962 and his screen debut as Blifil in 1963 British comedy Tom Jones. Warner was said to exude more “humanity” as Hamlet than any other actor before him when, at just 24, he played the lead as a disillusioned student prince in Peter Hall’s 1965 production. He returned to the stage in 2005 for the RSC to play Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2. Warner mostly played villains and said he enjoyed portraying the saintly Bob Cratchit in George C Scott’s 1984 adaptation of Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. His final film appearance was as retired naval officer Admiral Boom in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns. He died of a cancer-related illness at a care home and is survived by his son, Luke, by his second wife Sheilah Kent, and his partner, actress Lisa Bowerman.
