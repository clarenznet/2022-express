Staff at the AQA body are to stage a 72-hour walkout over pay, which union leaders warn could cause chaos for students awaiting results. Members belonging to the Unison union will take industrial action for three days, from Friday, July 29, to Sunday, July 31. Students will receive their GCSE results on August 25, while A-Level grades will be released on August 18. The union warned stoppages are likely to escalate unless talks are reopened. Many of the staff involved say they are struggling to make ends meet following successive below-inflation pay awards, Unison said. Staff were given an increase of 0.6 percent last year, with three percent offered this year, which Unison said is a real-terms pay cut. Unison official Lizanne Devonport said the workers have been left with “no other option” but to strike.  She said: “Pay has been falling behind prices for years and three percent isn’t a wage rise – with costs spiralling, it’s a pay cut. “Things are so bad staff are fearful they will no longer be able to make ends meet. Workers only strike as a last resort. “They’d rather be doing the jobs that they’re proud of. They don’t want to disrupt students and know how important exam results are to them.” One AQA worker told Unison: “We don’t want to disadvantage candidates. We value them and want them to succeed. But we have been trying to get a fair deal for months and have not been listened to.”
