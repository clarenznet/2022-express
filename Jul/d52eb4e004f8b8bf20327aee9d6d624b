The Queen has reportedly invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to stay with her at Balmoral during her summer break. Reacting to the news, Dr Mos-Shogbamimu hit out saying Harry and Meghan’s “haters will gnash teeth”. The commentator tweeted: “The Queen invites Harry and Meghan to Balmoral with their kids. “If true haters will gnash teeth cos they don’t want it." She added: “#HarryandMeghan win again.” Dr Shola’s tweet comes after reports the Queen has invited the Sussexes to stay at her private residence in the Scottish Highlands when other senior royals are not around. A Balmoral insider told the Sun: “Staff have been told to expect the full list of royals including Harry, Meghan and their children Archie and Lilibet. "They are preparing for the Sussexes.” Another source said: “Balmoral is the perfect place for them to spend a little bit of quality time with the Queen. "They barely had 15 minutes with her at the Jubilee.” However, another source questioned whether Harry and Meghan, who are living in California after quitting royal duties, would go to Balmoral. They said: “I would be stunned if they did turn up.” The Queen traditionally spends her summer holiday at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire where she is joined by other members of the Royal Family. It comes after Harry and Meghan returned to Britain with their two children for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations last month. The visit marked the first time the couple have travelled to the UK with Archie and Lilibet since Megxit. However the Sussexes kept a low profile during the festivities. And they reportedly jetted back to the US before the final event of the bank holiday weekend had finished. Harry and Meghan have set up home in the celebrity enclave of Montecito after stepping back as working royals in March 2020. There have been tensions between the pair and other senior royals amid Megxit.
