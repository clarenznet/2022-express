Great Britain’s Katie Boulter, 25, and her Aussie tennis ace beau Alex De Minaur, 23, have been enthralling Wimbledon 2022 fans with their power couple status on and off the court.  The lovebirds have both advanced through to the next round of Wimbledon after impressive wins during the week.  Katie is set to return to Centre Court to play Harmony Tan today.  The blonde beauty’s boyfriend, Alex De Minaur, beat Great Britain’s Jack Draper to achieve his place in the third round, where he is preparing to take on yet another Brit, Liam Broady.  Katie and Alex have gone from strength to strength as a couple after announcing their relationship on International Women’s Day two years ago, sharing several adorable pics of their holidays and celebrating big occasions together to their mutual Instagram accounts.  The competitive duo are now cheering each other on to reach their goals in Wimbledon 2022, with Alex sweetly telling the BBC following his recent win: “Before we talk about my match, can we talk about Katie Boulter today, she had a pretty good win herself.”
