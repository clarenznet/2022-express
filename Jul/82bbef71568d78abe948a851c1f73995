Over 1,000 members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are on strike at the Crown Post Offices, the larger branches often located on high streets, which are the ones affected by the disruption today. The strike will last 24-hour and it could cause "considerable delays," according to the union. The largest high-street branches are expected to be closed today due to the strike action. The sub-post offices, or smaller branches in rural areas, are still operating. A post office spokesman said: “There are 114 branches, typically in city centres, that are directly managed by Post Office and on previous strike days over a third have opened as usual. We’re disappointed that the CWU have made the decision to strike but remain hopeful that we can reach a pay agreement soon.” READ MORE: Boris Johnson net worth as he resigns as Prime Minister The following Crown Post Office branches could be affected by strike action on July 11: Antrim Bangor Belfast City Edinburgh City Glasgow Haddington Inverness Kirkwall Londonderry Newtownards Saltcoats Springburn Way Stornoway Wester Hailes Barnes Green Bransholme Bridlington Chester Le Street Crossgates Eccles  Furness House Grimsby Hyde Kendal Manchester Morecambe Morley Poulton Le Fylde Prestwich Rotherham Salford City Sheffield City South Shields St Johns Sunderland City The Markets Birmingham Breck Road Caernarfon Didsbury Village Harlesden Kettering Kingsbury Leigh Leighton Buzzard Matlock READ MORE: Improve your mood and 'lower stress' through dieting - expert advice Milton Keynes Northolt Old Swan Oswestry Oxford Redditch Southall St Peters Street Stamford Stockport Wealdstone Barnet Cambridge City Canning Town Cricklewood Dereham Golders Green Hampstead Harold Hill Kilburn Kingsland High Street Lower Edmonton Roman Road South Ockendon Stamford Hill Bideford Dunraven Place Gloucester Liskeard Merthyr Tydfil Mutley Nailsea Newquay Paignton Port Talbot Stroud Teignmouth Yate Sodbury Baker Street Bexhill On Sea Cosham Great Portland Street High Street (10) Kensington Knightsbridge Melville Road Paddington Quay Portsmouth Raynes Park Romsey Westbourne Windsor Worlds End Aldwych Brixton Broadway City of London Clapham Common East Dulwich Eccleston Street High Holborn Houndsditch Islington Kennington Park London Bridge Lupus Street Mount Pleasant Vauxhall Bridge Road
