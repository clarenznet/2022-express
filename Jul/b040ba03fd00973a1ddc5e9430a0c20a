James Martin, 50, hit the stage with his band when he performed at CarFest North 2022 on Saturday. The Saturday Morning host's girlfriend Louise Davies was front and centre as she supported her other half as he rocked out on stage. James played the guitar while wearing a floral blazer jacket which he teamed with a simple white t-shirt and black trousers. Louise kept her look casual as she sported a pair of white ripped jeans teamed with a shirt and a black leather jacket which she accompanied with boots. Her auburn tresses flowed down her back as she could be seen waving her hands along to James' music.
