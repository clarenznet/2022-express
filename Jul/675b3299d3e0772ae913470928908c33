Rupert Grint, 33, appears to be worlds away from the early days of his acting career, in which he portrayed teenage wizard Ronald Weasley as part of the Harry Potter film franchise. In his most recent venture, the actor will return to portray Julian Pearce in season four of Apple TV’s Servant, also starring Nell Tiger Free and Toby Kebbell.  The former child star was spotted on set of the show in Philadelphia, dressed in a dark green sweater, pink plaid shirt, and navy blue chinos.  Rupert’s character is shown to be frustrated and angry as he stuffs children’s party balloons into a car.  Other shots taken show Rupert’s body double grinning as he walks with swagger down a busy street, dressed in the same outfit.  Servant is an American psychological horror show Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and Sean Turner (Toby Kebbell), a Philadelphia couple who hire a girl named Leanne Grayson (Nell Tiger Free) to be the nanny for their infant son Jericho, a reborn doll.  Leanne's arrival brings about strange and frightening occurrences for the couple.
