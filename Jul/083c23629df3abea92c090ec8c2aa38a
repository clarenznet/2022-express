Amanda Holden flaunted her incredible set of pins as she headed into the Heart FM studios this morning for her presenting gig. The Britain's Got Talent judge, 51, looked phenomenal as she donned a red and white striped blazer with a matching pair of shorts to brave the UK's gloomy summer in. Amanda cut a glamorous figure as she matched her nails to her brightly coloured outfit and wore an oversized pair of sunglasses and a pair of white stilettos. The mother-of-two appearedÂ to be in good spirits as she smiled and waved while posing expertly for the pics. Once at work, Amanda enjoyed competing in Sports Day against her co-host Ashley Roberts while donning a tight pair of red shorts.
