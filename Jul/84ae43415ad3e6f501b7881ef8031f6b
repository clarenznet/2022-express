  Jennifer, 52, confirmed they had tied the knot in her newsletter, as she detailed the intimate ceremony held at the famous Little White Wedding Chapel. She also included some selfies from their special day, as well as some photographs of them getting ready for the big event. Often referred to as ‘Bennifer’, the couple initially became engaged in 2002 and split two years later, only to be reunited nearly two decades on in 2021. In the wedding announcement, Jennifer told her fans: “We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient.”
