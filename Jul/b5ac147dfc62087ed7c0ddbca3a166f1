After a few reasonably straightforward Wordle puzzles during the month of July, the creators of the popular puzzle game have returned with one of the toughest teasers that I can remember. Fortunately, Express Online is here to help, courtesy of three spoiler-free hints for Wordle 398 on July 22. Just head to the bottom of the page for the latest selection of clues and remember to check back tomorrow for even more helpful hints. Good luck, because you might just need it! The ideal game to play over breakfast or during your lunch break, Wordle tasks players with figuring out a five letter word in just six guesses. To master Wordle and solve those daily puzzles, you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles after each guess. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, as well as your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your precious winning streak.
