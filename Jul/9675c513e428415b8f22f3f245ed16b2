Key worker Mandy and pizza boss Alan met him in his Westminster office on Wednesday. Mandy, 43, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, said MPs and aides were scuttling through Parliament's corridors, speaking in hushed tones. She said: "It was very, very tense. A lady whispering with a colleague suddenly said, 'Make no mistake, this is all-out war'. "When I shook his hand, I said 'Thank you, Prime Minister. Good luck'. It felt like we knew he wasn't going to be here for long." Alan, 42, who runs a business in Bedford, said: "I think it was nice of him to make the time to meet us because obviously, there was a lot going on." Readers who grilled Mr Johnson in a No10 Q&A in March said yesterday he made the right call to resign. Gail Brown, 76, of Kidderminster, Worcs, said: "You need a leader of a nation to have high integrity. "Boris had great skill and could have been a wonderful PM, but he let himself, his party and most importantly, his country, down." Cystic fibrosis campaigner Carlie Pleasant, 32 of Sittingbourne, Kent, said: "Not admitting mistakes had an impact on the trust we had in him." Security and stewarding firm boss Jon Riches, 50, of Caerphilly, SouthWales, said: "It is disappointing to see him go, but his position as party leader and PM has now become untenable. It is the right thing to do."
