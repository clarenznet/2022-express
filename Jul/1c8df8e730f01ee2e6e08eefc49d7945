The town in east London is sixth in the top ten of areas most plagued by howling canines. Logbooks from environmental health officers reveal thousands of complaints were recorded with councils last year about barking dogs - with some authorities filing more than ten complaints every week.  The survey of 224 councils in England last year found there were 33,473 complaints from frustrated neighbours. Birmingham came out on top, with 1,175 complaints - and Barking and Dagenham Council received 562 calls. Authorities are now warning owners they face jail if they do not tackle their dogs' behaviour. Tactics to stop dogs barking include exercising them regularly, so they are not bored, and giving them activity toys.
