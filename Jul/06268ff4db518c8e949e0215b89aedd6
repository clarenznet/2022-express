Amanda Holden, 51, looked the epitome of chic despite the blistering heatwave that has the nation under alert. The Britain’s Got Talent star was photographed in a summery midi floral dress as she made her way towards Global Radio in London. Amanda put her youthful complexion on display by styling her blonde tresses in a low bun, while wearing minimal makeup. She paired her colourful dress with some off-white chunky platform heels, with a matching handbag and finished off the look with some maxi glasses.
