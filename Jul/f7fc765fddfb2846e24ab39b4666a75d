There is nothing more annoying than finding a fly floating in your glass while you are outside enjoying the warm weather. But fear not, Bethan Shufflebotham has a 1p hack that will ensure that you can enjoy your ice-cold beverages in the sun without having to worry about any unwanted visitors in your glass.  The Manchester Evening News reporter discovered the hack in 2019 when the wine brand Silver Bay Point shared it and she has been using it ever since. The best part about the hack is that you probably have all the tools you need at home without having to pop to the shops. Bethan revealed that all you need is a paper cupcake case. If you do not have any lurking about in your cupboards, you can pick up a pack of 100 from Asda for 70p - making them less than a penny each. Bethan wrote: "The hack is super easy to do, you’ll just need a cupcake case, a straw and a small pair of scissors. "Firstly, find the centre of the cupcake case and cut a tiny cross in the middle just big enough to fit the straw. "Then, place the cupcake case upside down over the top of your glass to create a lid, pushing the straw through to create a fly-proof summer drink. "If it’s a bit breezy out, you could use a little bit of tape to keep it in place, but I found it to be okay as the straw mostly kept it over the glass. "You’ll want to pick the right sized cupcake case for your glass, or ditch your balloon gin glass for something more narrow, but it also works to help cover up cans and bottles, too.  "And that’s not all they’re useful for! Parents can use the cupcake cases the right way up to stop ice lollies dripping onto their little ones’ hands. "They can be pushed up the sticks to create a bowl under the lolly, helping save on mess and extra clothes washing."
