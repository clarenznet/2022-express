Demi Rose put on an eye-popping display today as she took to her Instagram stories in a tiny blue and white patterned corset. The Pretty Little Thing model, 27, looked as though she was ready to spill out of the lingerie which she paired with blue jeans as she showcased her outfit to her 19.9 million followers. Demi's tiny waist was emphasised thanks to the nature of the corset which featured a peek-a-boo gap in between her breasts. The star wore her long brown tresses in a plait which fell over her chest as she sat for the clip. Looking glamorous as ever, Demi donned a full face of make-up and accentuated her doe-shaped eyes with winged eyeliner.
