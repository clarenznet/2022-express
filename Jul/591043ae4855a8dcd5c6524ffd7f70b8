Laura Hamilton, 40, looked amazing as she soaked up the sun in Cyprus, updating her followers throughout the trip. The A Place in the Sun host took to Instagram last night to share two snaps of herself stripped down to a bikini. In the first photo, Laura can be seen to be smiling as she laid at the corner of the pool, showing off her sensational gym-honed figure. Likewise, while enjoying the beach, Laura posted another picture of herself in a white bikini as she posed with her arms in the air. She showed off her incredible gym-honed figure, along with having her ample assets on full show in the small white bikini. Laura captioned the post in view of her 158,000 Instagram followers: "Are you a pool or beach person?... comment. "I am always grateful to enjoy afternoons off in beautiful locations."
