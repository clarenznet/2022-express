Mad Max actress Charlize Theron looks angelic in unearthed photos from the 2 Days in the Valley premiere in 1996. Charlize, 46, played Helga Svelge in the iconic crime film. In the movie, the paths of two hitmen, two police officers and others connected to them cross when the assassins are assigned to murder an Olympic athlete's husband in Hollywood. Charlize wore a simple black strappy mini dress with a white lace trim. Her blonde hair was styled in a chic 90s up â€˜do, while her frosted blue eyeshadow was also very typical of the time. More recently, Charlize has been exhibiting a drastically different look, dyeing her hair much darker before appearing at the Africa Outreach Project 2022 Summer Block Party.
