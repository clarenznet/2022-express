Charles Leclerc managed to grab pole position by pipping Max Verstappen at the end of Saturday's qualifying session at the French Grand Prix. The Ferrari man went quickest with his final lap of the day and will line up at the very front of the grid for Sunday's race as a result of his impressive showing against the clock. It remains to be seen whether Leclerc will be able to hold off Verstappen when the five red lights go out on Sunday afternoon, though. Ferrari enjoyed a significant one-lap advantage over Red Bull in qualifying but the Austrian outfit could be quicker over a race distance, which suggests that another titanic battle between this year's title contenders will unfold over the course of the 53-lap contest. Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, was able to put his Mercedes car in fourth place with an impressive effort at the end of Q3 and will line up on the second row of the grid behind Sergio Perez for Sunday's race. Lando Norris also produced a rapid lap in the dying seconds to get up into fifth ahead of George Russell, Fernando Alonso and Yuki Tsunoda. Follow Express Sport's live updates from qualifying below.
