Experts are warning the UK is now facing its fifth wave of coronavirus infections as case rates and hospital admissions increase across Britain. There has been a marked increase in the number of cases being reported each day, with more than 20,000 cases a day in the last days of June. Professor Christina Pagel said during a recent briefing by the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage): “The new wave is now starting. “We will have a new wave of infections this month. Now hopefully it won’t be as high as the previous two waves and might be lower. “But we can’t count on that and either way we are going to see more people becoming infected.” Hospital admissions have increased 31 percent, climbing at a higher rate than the last Omicron wave in March this year.

The surge in cases is through to be driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants of Omicron that were first discovered in South Africa in January. It is the same strain spread rapidly across the UK in December 2021 and January 2022. Hospitals in Wales have now reintroduced face masks and the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation Sir Andrew Pollard has said it would be “sensible” for hospitals across the UK to reintroduce the measure. According to GOV.UK, in England and Wales, the Isle of Wight currently has the highest infection rate, with a current rate of 396.4 per 100,000 people testing positive. Cambridgeshire and Oxfordshire come in second and third, with case rates of 313.8 and 293.2 respectively. Bracknell Forest in Berkshire is not for behind, with 285.1 infections per 100,000 people. Hampshire has the fifth-highest infection rate, coming in at 277.6 per 100,000.
