The resignations of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Heath Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday evening triggered an avalanche of further resignations. As it became increasingly clear that Boris Johnson’s position was untenable, the Prime Minister initially dug in, refusing to stand down from his position.  However, when the new Chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, urged him to “do the right thing and go now”, after just 36 hours in his position, it appears Mr Johnson finally relented. The current favourite to take over as Tory Party leader is current Minister of State for Trade Policy Penny Mordaunt, with odds of 9/2 according to Ladbrokes. Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is the second favourite to take the job with odds of 13/2. This is followed by Ben Wallace, with odds of 7/1 and in fourth is Liz Truss at 19/2 tied with Jeremy Hunt.
