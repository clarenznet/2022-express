The TaxPayers’ Alliance revealed Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, took home £151,371 last year. And his number two, Assistant General Secretary, Simon Weller, received £130,230 in 2021. Campaigners warned the public are "fed up" with lectures from union barons earning hundreds of thousands. Members of the drivers’ union Aslef at eight train companies overwhelmingly voted to walk out over pay. Workers at Chiltern, GWR, LNER, London Overground, Northern, Southeastern, TransPennine and West Midlands will walk out after the companies offered a two per cent pay rise. But bosses at the union received 10 per cent pay rises on the previous year, when inflation was at 2.6 per cent between 2020-21, according to the Bank of England. Danielle Boxall, media campaign manager of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Taxpayers are fed up with lectures and disruption from loaded union leaders. “These red barons are dooming commuters to misery, but are sitting comfortably as some of Britain’s biggest earners in taxpayer-backed unions. “Ministers must take a stand against these hypocritical union heads.   Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef said strikes “are always the last resort” but he said that many union members “have not had a pay rise since 2019”. “We want an increase in line with the cost of living - we want to be able to buy, in 2022, what we could buy in 2021,” he said. It comes after passengers faced major disruption in June due to separate strike action by 40,000 rail workers. Members of the RMT union at 13 train companies and Network Rail walked out in what was the biggest rail strike in 30 years. Talks between the RMT union and rail operators will resume on Wednesday.
