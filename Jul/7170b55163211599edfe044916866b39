Sir Anthony Hopkins proved age is nothing but a number as he danced around his enormous living room in an Instagram video today. The 84-year-old looked energetic as he pranced around in a colourful Hawaiian shirt, fedora and brown trousers. Hannibal actor Anthony waved his arms around as he sauntered towards the unseen camera operator, lifting his hat off his head as he twirled. The star even gave his 3.5 million followers a cheeky wink as the video ended. “Sunday Summer Vibes,” he wrote, alongside a sunglasses face emoji. His fans were delighted by the clip, as Susana commented: “So lovely!!! Hugs from Colombia!!!” “Best thing on internet today,”(sic) added Naman. Meanwhile, supermodel Naomi Campbell wrote a row of love heart emojis.
