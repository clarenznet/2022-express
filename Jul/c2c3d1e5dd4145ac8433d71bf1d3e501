Queen Rania of Jordan, 51, married her husband King Abdullah II, 60, on June 10, 1993. In 1993, Abdullah was still a Prince as he did not become King until 1999. The couple’s wedding broke royal tradition as Rania opted against wearing a tiara for the day.  Rania, who was 22 at the time, chose British designer Bruce Oldfield to create her wedding dress. Drawing on inspiration from the embellishments on Syrian formal dresses exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Mr Oldfield added gold detailing to the trim of the bride’s voluminous gown, matching hair ornament and gloves. The exaggerated lapels, short sleeves, and large belt create a powerful suit dress look. The skirt was full of folds and it extended into a train at the back.

Her towering hairstyle was reportedly so tall, that it made the car entry and departure process quite difficult. The hairstyle was accented, not with a tiara, but with a headband, an everyday wardrobe staple for most women. For a later reception, Rania donned a new dress.  The second gown was sleeveless, featuring a V-neck at the front and a similar dip at the back, with plenty of embellishment. Once again, the new royal sported a major hairdo. Why did Rania not wear a tiara to her wedding? Abdullah was not the Crown Prince at the time of his marriage. That job belonged to his uncle, Hassan. It wasn’t until right before King Hussein’s death that Abdullah was named Crown Prince.

Therefore, Rania may have opted against a tiara as she was too far down the pecking order. In fact, Queen Rania did not have her own tiara commissioned until 2003. Although Queen Elizabeth II inherited a huge collection of crowns, tiaras, and diadems when she ascended the throne, Queen Rania of Jordan did not.
