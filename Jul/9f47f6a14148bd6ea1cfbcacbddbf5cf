Ronaldo missed United's pre-season tour for family reasons, but he has let it be known he wants to leave if a suitable offer is made. His Old Trafford and Portgual team-mate Diogo Dalot has urged him to stay. "Cristiano is important for us," said Dalot. "What we know is he is going through some family issues and we hope everything is OK." Dalot also admitted United's players felt the full force of Erik ten Hag's anger after they conceded a last-gasp goal to draw 2-2 with AstonVilla in Perth. "It's discipline," added Dalot. "We need to be ready for that, to be ready to hear things that maybe we don't want to hear. "Everything is for the greater good of the team. We start from scratch, new manager, new staff, new energy, new players coming in and we're looking forward to playing with them as well. "We need to build a team, a staff, a club, everyone together and go forward. It's tough, but we need to adjust quickly.We need to be ready for any kind of challenge." Dalot, who joined United from Porto for £19million in 2018, has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford. He went on loan to AC Milan in the 2020-21 season, but has re-established himself as United's right-back ahead of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. "I feel like I'm a Man United player, but obviously you have to work every single day to play," said Dalot. "I want to be ready for the manager, for the club, and every time he needs me I'm going to be there. I need to show my qualities as well. This is why I came here."
