No landmark UK-based celebration is complete without a Red Arrows display, as the planes proved during the Platinum Jubilee this year. Today they will appear at another British staple event, the Silverstone Grand Prix, as part of a packed schedule. People who want to watch the planes in all their majesty have a few opportunities available this afternoon. The Red Arrows take part in two official displays that will bring them within range of dozens of locations in a few short hours. In total, the planes will grace the skies above more than 30 places throughout southern and central England. People living in the areas can watch in person, and Express.co.uk has the troupe's exact schedule on hand.

The planes will embark on the following route tonight after living off at 8.55pm: Vicinity of Milton Underwychwood: 8.57pm Northwest of Flore: 9.02pm Northeast of Somerby: 9.07pm Vicinity of North Scarle: 9.11pm RAF Scampton: 9.13pm While the Red Arrows will arc over a vast clutch of destinations today, not everyone will get the chance to see them in person. They can also watch online, as Silverstone is receiving wall-to-wall coverage from several channels due to the Grand Prix. The Wales airshow at Swansea has a dedicated live stream showing events today, which people can view via YouTube and Facebook. Bletchley Park, unfortunately, won't carry the same service for its flyover, and the transit likely won't either, given it is not an official display. While the Red Arrows conclude their display schedule this weekend, it marks the start of a busy month for the aeronautic acrobats. They have another 11 appearances on the cards from July 9 to July 28. Upcoming Red Arrows performances include: July 9 to 10: Southport Airshow July 10 to 17: Royal International Air Tattoo, RAF Fairford July 20: Peterhead - Scottish Week July 20: RAF Lossiemouth Families Day Display July 21: RAF Leeming Families Day Display July 23: The Making Waves Festival 2022, Irvine, Scotland July 24: Bray Air Display, Ireland July 28: RAF Marham Families Day Display
