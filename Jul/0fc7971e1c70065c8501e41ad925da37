Charlene and Albert's twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella graduated from Seadventures Summer Camp last Friday. The seven-year-old royal youngsters were awarded medals as their mum and dad watched on. And the family posed for an adorable photo afterwards as the twins showed off their medals. At one point, Albert was also seen kneeling down to take a picture of his children as they were given their medals. Charlene, 44, was typically elegant in a white top and trousers for the outing. The former Olympic swimmer completed her chic look with a slick of red lipstick. Meanwhile, Albert, 64, teamed a blazer, shirt and tie with a baseball cap. It comes just weeks after the couple celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary. Charlene took to Instagram on July 1 to share a photo with Albert. The Monaco royal looked stunning in a long green gown for the special occasion.
