Lee Westwood issued a blunt response to Tiger Woods’ criticism of LIV golf stars. The 49-year-old joined the likes of Phil Mickelson and Louis Oosthuizen, former champions at The Open and Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka competing on the controversial breakaway circuit. They were banned from competing on the PGA and have been ostracised by sections of the golfing world. For example, LIV founder Greg Norman was banned from attending The Open’s 150th anniversary tournament and Mickelson was warned off attending the R&A’s champions dinner on Tuesday night. When The Open's press conference schedule was released, not a single player affiliated with LIV was on it and Ian Poulter received boos from the crowd when he began his campaign yesterday. Fellow players have criticised the event and ahead of this year’s Open, Woods, who turned down over £100million to sign for LIV, compared the 54-hole format to the Seniors Tour earlier this week at The Open. “I just don't understand it,” said Woods. “What is the incentive to go out there and earn it in the dirt?” After Woods essentially compared LIV to an exhibition event, perhaps because it offers $25m prize money for each event to the 48-man field with no cut, Westwood, 49, now the world No.94, hit back.

"As a British player it is the best tournament of the year. The atmosphere is incredible. “I think the general public just want to go out there and see good golf, no matter where it is being played or who is playing it.”
