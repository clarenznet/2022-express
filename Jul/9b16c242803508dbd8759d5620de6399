Last month's Day of Action, fronted by ex Strictly judge Len Goodman, highlighted the benefit designed to help with daily living costs. Recipients do not need to have a state pension to get it - and it tops up income to £182.60 for single pensioners, £278.70 for a couple. The Department forWork and Pensions yesterday revealed the 275 percent boost in claims following the campaign.  And Pensions Minister Guy Opperman urged Daily Express readers to spread the word. He said of Pension Credit recipients they "could be in line for extra support worth an average of over £3,300 a year.We're calling on those with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra help. "With rising costs, it's never been more important. Please spread the word."
