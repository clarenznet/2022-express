The British No.1's Argentine right-hand man Facundo Lugones also revealed that the ace's girlfriend, Louise Jacobi, 23, has "had a really good impact on him". The 26-year-old star faces defending Wimbledon champ Novak Djokovic tomorrow for a place in the final. Facundo, 30, said: "He plays a lot of games with his fitness trainer, Vasek [Jursik] - card games, plays backgammon, plays Ludo. "Plays always for coffees. They compete and they keep track of the coffees they owe to each other. He needs to stay competing all the time. He can't unwind from competition." Cameron has told how aged "20, 21", while studying in Texas, he crashed his moped while trying to see his then girlfriend after a night out. But Facundo said he has changed and a key to his success is an extreme fitness regime. He said: "Now he's a man. Before he was just a kid. I mean, his maturity, the way he goes about his business." Cameron's dad David has admitted he struggled during his son's five-set quarter-final victory over David Goffin.  He called the last few points "torture but in some ways it was a wonderful experience but it was hard to watch I must say". David said he will tell his son to "enjoy the moment because it's not that often you get to the semi-final of a grand slam, no matter what level you play at, so he must just embrace the moment and use the crowd". But he insisted Cameron is "coping admirably". Meanwhile, among those watching the action at Wimbledon yesterday were chat-show legend Michael Parkinson and former England skipper David Beckham.
