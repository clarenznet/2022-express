Football may not come home on Sunday, but England’s women’s captain Leah Williamson feels the Lionesses are finally going to cross the threshold. Their scintillating football has lit up stadiums all over the country this summer, from the opener at Old Trafford, via the south coast, to the absorbing semi-final against Sweden at Bramall Lane. Now, though, the focus is very much on Wembley and for Williamson it feels like there is no better place to end their incredible journey.“I haven’t thought about it yet, we’ve got some preparation to do, we don’t even know who we are playing yet,” Williamson said.“But for me, to walk out onto that pitch is an incredible feeling. It was in Sheffield and I can imagine at the weekend that will be incredible as well.“I’ve got a scarf around my neck which says, ‘home is where the heart is’ and to have our families on this journey, to walk out at Wembley, I think that is something we really have to take in.“I am not much of a smiler pre-game, I keep it pretty ‘game-face’, because I am focused. But the last two national anthems I can’t help but smile because it feels amazing. “I know I have a job to do, but who says I can’t enjoy those moments and the team can’t enjoy those moments?“That’s what I hope that we are giving off that vibe because that’s what it is.“It’s genuine and the crowd can enjoy that with us.“I hope that Wembley crowd is going to have as good a time as we are going to have, because I promise you, we will enjoy it.”Behind the smiles and the singing after the final whistle on Tuesday lies a decades-long battle for recognition in a country where the men’s game dominates.Regardless of what happens against France or Germany on Sunday, Williamson paid tribute to the players that had got the team to the point where a large part of the nation is expected to sit down in front of their TVs and take notice.“We started a journey and we’ve got people with us,” Williamson said.  “We’ve changed the game and that’s what’s happened - but that’s the people before us. “That’s the likes of Carol Thomas, Jill Scott, Ellen White, who I looked at and was inspired by when I was younger. “Now it is about doing our job on the pitch. That’s the biggest way we can contribute and that’s what we are focused on.” “We started a journey and we’ve got people with us,” Williamson said. “We’ve changed the game and that’s what’s happened - but that’s the people before us. “That’s the likes of Carol Thomas, Jill Scott, Ellen White, who I looked at and was inspired by when I was younger.“Now it is about doing our job on the pitch.
