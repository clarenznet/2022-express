Now, the summer is set to be besieged by further disruption with the first national rail strike in almost 30 years. The walkouts over pay will make it nigh on impossible to get to work, seek essential health care, or simply enjoy the summer holidays. Even more aggravating is that train drivers already take home on average £59,000 - nearly double the national median salary. And it’s not just the railways. Across the public sector, we’re seeing unrealistic pay demands spurred on by militant unions. From teachers to tube workers, trade unions are threatening to wreak havoc. Their demands can only be met with yet more tax hikes, when taxpayers are already suffering a horrendous burden. Ministers must stand firm against those who seek to disrupt our lives and derail our economy. But they can also take steps to prevent the unions from holding the country hostage in the first place. Many taxpayers will not be aware of the subsidies they are paying to unions via “facility time” - a practice which allows public sector employees who serve as trade union representatives to take paid time off work to carry out union duties. The latest figures show there are nearly 24,000 of them in the public sector, costing taxpayers almost £100 million a year. When unreported facility time is taken into account, the figure could reach up to £200 million. It simply isn’t fair for taxpayers to shoulder this burden when unions are raising substantial sums. The government should cap facility time to no more than the current civil service average, and ensure that no individual public sector worker can spend more than half their time on trade union duties. It’s about time ministers put an end to unions being propped up by the public purse and stop taxpayers being taken for a ride.
