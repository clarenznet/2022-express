The summer transfer window is into its second day of July and there are still plenty of scores to be settled. Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham are all central to the latest transfer drama, among other clubs, as the race to recruit gathers pace ahead of next season. Manchester United fans have been kept on the edge of their seats in recent weeks, with a successful summer potentially hinging on a move for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Chelsea are reportedly waiting to pounce on the Dutchman if he decides that Champions League football is non-negotiable. But the Red Devils are at least set to steer clear of obstacles when it comes to Feyenoord's Tyrell Malacia. The left-back has supposedly agreed personal terms, leaving just the fine details and a medical to complete before it's signed and sealed. Meanwhile, Chelsea and Tottenham are in the heat of battle for Leeds United star Raphinha, who is starring in one of the summer's most dramatic transfer sagas so far. With Arsenal and Barcelona still thought to be in the mix, anything could happen from here. FOLLOW EXPRESS SPORT'S LIVE UPDATES BELOW...
