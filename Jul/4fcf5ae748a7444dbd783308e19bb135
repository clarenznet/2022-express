MP Paul Maynard posted a large photo of himself alongside a statement backing Mr Sunak on internet service Twitter. Responses included one from Con O’Neill, co-star of US comedy Our Flag Means Death, who said: “Is @PaulMaynardUK sitting on his pencil case?” A reply from someone with the username BWallArthur stated: “The vacant look says it all.” Twitter user cliffsmith23, whose profile states he is a photographer, said: “Paul Maynard paid a professional photographer for a portrait session. They would have taken dozens of shots of different poses and expressions, or with different lights, to try and capture the most flattering image they could. And despite all that, this was the one he chose.” And a reply from DavidHeadViews said: “You look surprised to be saying that.” However, some Twitter users appealed to others to end the comments. A person with the username spikeuk stated: “He has cerebral palsy. Lots of reasons to criticise Paul Maynard but his appearance isn’t one of them.” Mr Maynard has said that cerebral palsy may make him a better MP, by giving him a different perspective to other politicians. He says on his official website: “Yes, I have cerebral palsy. It’s very mild, and doesn’t really affect how I live. It probably affects the way some people see me, and there will always be people who write you off because of it – but I’ve never let them stop me.”
