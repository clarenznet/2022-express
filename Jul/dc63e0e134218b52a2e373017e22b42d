Eva Longoria, 47, looked delighted to be holidaying in the sultry Spanish city, as she chilled out at her "favourite restaurant" in an idyllic golf resort and got beach ready in her sensational swimwear. She shared snaps of herself keeping her style simple in a classic white bikini, which showed off her toned and flawless body. The actress and close friend of Victoria Beckham displayed her taut and totally flat tummy in the outfit, while posing with pals including swimwear entrepreneur Melissa Odabash. Eva posed barefoot as she marked National Tequila Day with a visit to one of the drink's production plants. She took playful photos of herself, arms outstretched next to a giant barrel of tequila that looked at least three times as tall as she is, and of course sampled some of the mouth-watering refreshment.
