 Drivers are not the only ones on the road who have to abide by the Highway Code and other rules. Cyclists could be hit with massive fines if they do not use the roads correctly in a safe and responsible manner.  While there are no laws on how fast a cyclist can travel, riders should attempt to stay at a sensible speed or risk fines. Rule 66 of The Highway Codes states: “You should avoid any actions that could reduce your control of your cycle.” Getting stopped for careless cycling could see them fined £1,000.

This applies to traffic light junctions and at cycle-only crossings where they must not cross the stop line when the red light is there. In the Highway Code, Rule 71, clarifies that some roads have an advanced stop line, in which case drivers can cross the first stop line, but not the final line.

But for all other road users, Rule 66 makes clear that cyclists should be “considerate” of the needs of other road users when riding in groups. They can ride two abreast and it can be safer to do so, particularly in larger groups or when accompanying children or less experienced riders.  Cyclists are prohibited from riding in a “dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner”. Under the Road Traffic Act 1998, dangerous cycling comes with a maximum fin of £2,500, with cyclists facing a £1,000 fine for careless cycling. Riding on the pavement is also discouraged in the Highway Code and can come with a £500 fine.  Cyclists must have white front and red rear lights lit when riding at night. It must also be fitted with a red rear reflector and amber pedal reflectors, if manufactured after October 1, 1985. Flashing lights are permitted but it is recommended that cyclists who are riding in areas without street lighting use a steady front lamp.
