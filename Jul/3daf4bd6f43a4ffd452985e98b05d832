Blackpink and PUBG are teaming-up for the first ever in-game concert to be held in the Mobile version of the hit shooter. This weekend the hugely popular K-pop girl group will be starring in PUBG Mobile The Virtual event. The standout highlight of this will be an in-game concert from the Kill This Love and BOOMBAYAH stars. Depending on where you are in the world, the Blackpink PUBG event - which is called The Virtual - will either be held on July 22 and July 23 or July 23 and July 24. If you can't tune in on these dates then there will be a second chance to experience the PUBG Blackpink event later this month. The Blackpink event in PUBG will see the K-pop stars debut a new song called 'Ready For Love'. While there will also be rewards to claim, including custom-made outfits the Blackpink stars will wear for the PUBG performance. These outfits will be available until August 31. PUBG Mobile players will also be able to access a Blackpink voice pack which has voice commands from Blackpink members Jisoo, Jennie, Rose and Lisa which can be used in-game. If you want to tune in to the Blackpink PUBG event then download PUBG Mobile via the App Store and Google Play Store. Then, players can secure their free tickets for The Virtual concert in-game and preload the Concert Resource Pack to prepare for the show. There are two sets of dates for the Blackpink PUBG concert - this weekend and then on either July 29 to July 30, or July 30 to July 31 depending on which region you're in.
