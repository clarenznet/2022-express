The Women’s Rights Network will take “a range of coordinated actions” to ensure every leadership hopeful understands their importance. WRN spokeswoman Heather Binning said Mr Johnson recognised the importance of protecting single-sex spaces. She said: “It is vital that the next leader of the Conservative leader – and Prime Minister – does, too.” Ms Binning added: “Women had to fight for the right to vote and, make no mistake, we will use our votes to defend our rights. Our members want clear, unequivocal assurances from all the leadership hopefuls.” WRN plans to ask every candidate where they stand on women’s rights.
