Damian McConville, 33, of Belfast, who had to sleep on the floor at Gatwick airport, said easyJet did not tell him and his wife they could be reimbursed up to Â£880. Which? has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to investigate. Airlines must rebook passengers at the "earliest opportunity" - and with another airline if necessary.

EasyJet said its website's delays and cancellations help page "clearly" informed passengers of their rights.
