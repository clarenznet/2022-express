The Amazon Prime Day 2022 sales have begun, with the huge annual discount event taking place on Tuesday July 12 and Wednesday July 13. Millions of deals are available exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers during Prime Day 2022, and one of the best offers is for the 4th gen Echo Dot. This Alexa speaker has had its price reduced from £49.99 to £19.99 - and if you head to money-saving website TopCashback you can get a further discount which brings the price down to around £9. If you haven't heard of TopCashback, but love a good bargain, it's a site you need to add to your regular website crawl. TopCashback is a money-saving website which offers its users the chance to earn cashback on purchases from thousands of online stores. The way it can offer this is TopCashback earns commission for directing its users to different websites, and this commission is then passed on "100 percent" to its users. Depending on which site you visit you'll either be able to get discounts on select lines or products or virtually everything available online. With Amazon UK, TopCashback offers cashback rates on first-party Amazon devices such as the Echo smart speaker range. TopCashback offers 2.5 percent cashback on these purchases, plus right now it is offering new members a £10 signing-on reward. This bonus can be used when purchasing a product which TopCashback offers cashback on that is worth over £10. To take advantage of this deal, you firstly need to head to this page on the TopCashback website and sign-up as a new member. Then, you need to head to the Amazon hub page on the TopCashback website. You will have to find the product you're after - which in this case is the Echo speakers - and click the Get Cashback button next to this product line. This will direct you to the Amazon website where you will need to complete your order. However, when you head to the Amazon checkout page you won't see the Echo Dot listed for around £9. Instead, you will have to purchase the Echo Dot at its listed price (which is £19.99 for Amazon Prime members) and then you will have money topped up to your TopCashback account. This will bring the Echo Dot 4th gen model down to £9.50. To withdraw money from your TopCashback profile, you will have to head to the TopCashback account page. Then, you will be able to transfer the money out of your account either via a BACS transfer, by moving your money to a PayPal account or by topping up a gift card. It's also worth pointing out that this Echo Dot deal is exclusively available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you're not already a member you can sign up to an Amazon Prime free trial so you can take advantage of all the discounts available for Prime Day 2022. Make sure you do this first, and ensure you are logged in via an account with Prime membership on the Amazon website before heading to TopCashback to sign up as a new member. MORE LIKE THIS
