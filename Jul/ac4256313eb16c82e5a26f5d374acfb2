"They took away my spring, they took away my summer, and now they've taken away seven more years of my life," a Moscow district councillor was quoted as saying after he was handed a seven-year prison sentence for criticising Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Â Alexei Gorinov, a member of the Krasnoselsky district council, told a council meeting on March 15, where a children's drawing contest was discussed, that Moscow was waging a war of aggression against Kyiv. In a recording posted on YouTube, he can be heard saying: "What kind of children's drawing contest can we talk about for Children's Day ... when we have children dying every day?" A Kremlin-critical lawyer said Mr Gorinov's imprisonment on Friday was the first case of anyone going to jail under a new law on "fake information", which was passed shortly after the full-scale conflict began on February 24.
