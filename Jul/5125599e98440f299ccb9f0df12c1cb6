Satellite images appear to show that more than 100 vehicles have been moved from the Alakurtti military base near the Finnish border, according to Euromaidan press. The vehicles likely have been moved to Ukraine as Russian losses mount there. Dozens of armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles, along with 800 - 1000 soldiers are reported to have left. Russian expert Marko Eklund said: “It is very likely that they were sent by train to Ukraine.” Russia has not announced any troop movements from the base. The news comes as Canada became the first NATO country to ratify Sweden and Finland’s request to join NATO. If Finland joins the alliance, it would more than double NATO’s land border with Russia - a serious blow to Putin who has claimed NATO expansion is a threat to Russian security. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: “Canada has full confidence in Finland and Sweden’s ability to integrate quickly and effectively into NATO and contribute to the Alliance’s collective defence. We have always welcomed their close partnership with the Alliance and their valuable contributions to transatlantic security.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
