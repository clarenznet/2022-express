FortniteÂ developer Epic Games will take Battle Royale, Creative and Save the World offline for server maintenance as part of the release of update 21.20. Fortnite's next major update has a July 6 release date on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and Switch. The bad news is that while the new update will add in-game items and events, it will also be accompanied by a period of server downtime. According to Epic Games on Twitter, Fortnite matchmaking will be disabled at 8.30am BST in the UK. If you're already in a match before 8.30am, you can continue to play until servers go offline in full at 9am BST UK time. At 9am BST (4am ET), all players will be kicked out of Fortnite until the scheduled downtime comes to an end. You can make maintenance go by faster by downloading and installing the update. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter: "You call this downtime? Update v21.20 is charging up! Downtime starts at 04:00 ET (09:00 UTC), with matchmaking being disabled 30 minutes prior." According to Fortnite insider Shiina, update 21.20 is expected to make changes to a couple of points of interest on the map. Likely contenders include Big Sleepy Sound, Condo Canyon, or Tumbledown Temple. Fans can also expect new summer event details, as well as the release of the Indiana Jones Battle Pass skins and items. Needless to say, Epic Games will also make a host of gameplay tweaks and bug fixes. Finally, you can expect at least one weapon to be unvaulted, as well as the release of new challenges.
