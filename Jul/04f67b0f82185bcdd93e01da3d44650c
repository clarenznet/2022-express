This year, cinch is the first official presenting partner of CarFest and will have plenty on offer for car enthusiasts. The cinch paddock will give festival-goers the chance to test drive everything from state-of-the-art Teslas to sporty Minis. With the largest range of cars on site, the cinch paddock has something to suit every need, from school runs to business meetings. From silky-smooth electric vehicles and versatile hybrids to the roar of petrol engines, cinch has it all. Visitors can satisfy their curiosity with an early morning deep dive at the cinch genius bar, or just take five and recharge – cinch has something for everyone. Sam Sheehan, Motoring and Lifestyle Editor at cinch, spoke to Express.co.uk about what attendees can expect from the weekend.

Anyone visiting the area can test drive a Tesla Model 3, Jaguar I-Pace and many more supercars. Sam said the festival was the perfect place for car enthusiasts to get their fix to see the best cars from the past, present and future. One of the most “outrageous” spectacles on offer is the 1932 Ford Hot Rod, which is the only one of its kind in the UK and always grabs attention with its ability to burn rubber. CarFest North will contain seven festivals in one, including CarFest, AdventureFest, KidsFest, Great British Food Fest, RetroFest, StarFest and SpaFest. As part of the partnership, cinch will be donating £50 from every car sold online in the week before each festival. This will help CarFest’s mission to raise over £3million for UK children’s charities this year. Speaking about whether guests could expect any surprises at the event, Sam Sheehan said: “As CarFest’s new title sponsor, it would be rude not to have a couple surprises up our sleeve, wouldn’t it? “So, cinch will be giving away a car worth up to £10,000, plus, if you visit our stand, you’ll find a £500 cashback offer code that can be used on cinch.co.uk. “No joke. “Additionally, we’ll have some smaller freebies to hand out on our stand, where there’ll also be a selection of cars to have a snoop around. “Oh, and did we mention that we’ll have six cars that you can take for a test drive? So don’t forget to bring your licence.” CarFest North will take place at Bolesworth Estate in Cheshire this weekend (July 22-24), with Hampshire playing host to CarFest South between August 26 and 28.
