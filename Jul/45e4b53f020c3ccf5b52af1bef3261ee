Posing in her Lorraine dressing room, the Countdown star, 61, put on an eye-popping display in the leopard-print leggings which accentuated her incredible curves. Carol paired the printed trousers with a pretty white shirt on top, which revealed just a hint of cleavage. The day before, the Welsh native had ramped up the glam in a khaki midi skirt, nude stilettos and a lemon yellow top with a cut-out panel. This morning, Carol shared a make-up free selfie with her 229,000 followers, promising to be fully made-up by the time she went on national TV. She wrote: "Morning early campers. 5.30am....ready for this amazing day to kick off. Join me on @lorraine at 9am for a cracking show....don't worry make up will have been applied by then. Don't want to frighten the children!!!!" she penned alongside laughing face emojis.
