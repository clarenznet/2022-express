Michael Douglas looked much younger than his 77 years as he stepped out to enjoy an afternoon at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix.  It wasn’t long before the Hollywood star got involved in an animated chat with female Formula 1 fans as he made his way to the VIP area.  Michael attended the grand finale of the weekend without his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, by his side, suggesting that he is the main F1 enthusiast in the couple’s family.  The Basic Instinct actor grinned for cameras while wearing a pair of sunglasses and a baseball cap to protect his face from the sun’s rays.  Michael opted for a dressed down look for the Grand Prix, as he donned a grey jumper paired with a lilac shirt, navy blue trousers, and black trainers.
