He and Kylie Minogue posed for selfies as they filmed the last scenes for the final episode of the soap. The pair, both 54, played Charlene and Scott Robinson in the Australian series. Their wedding episode was watched by an audience of almost 20 million when it was shown in the UK in 1988. For the finale special, Kylie wore the denim mechanic's overalls of her Neighbours character with West End star Jason sporting a check shirt and jeans. She shared the images with her 2.4million Instagram followers and referenced their No 1 single Especially For You: "Now we're back together." Jason posted a photo of the sign for Ramsay Street, signed by him and his co-star, as well as a snap of the cover of his script. He wrote: "So good to be back with this absolute legend@kylieminogue." Neighbours is ending after failing to secure funding since being dropped by its broadcaster. The double-episode special will be on Channel 5 at 9pm on July 29.
