There are some very enticing freebies available, but they won't be around for long. Sky and Virgin Media have both launched blockbuster offers with customers able to grab Netflix without paying the monthly fee or get sent an Xbox Series S completely free. These are truly epic deals but neither will be around for much longer as Sky and Virgin Media have both confirmed the freebies will end tomorrow, July 14. If you fancy taking advantage of the free Xbox – easily one of the best Virgin Media broadband deals we've ever come across – and free Netflix, we've got the details on how to grab the free gift before the deadline tomorrow night. This blockbuster free Xbox deal is available to new users who sign up for certain broadband and TV plans including the Bigger bundle + Movies bundle and Ultimate Volt bundle. Once Virgin has confirmed the contract, a new Xbox Series S will then be popped in the post. It's a decent offer as this latest gaming device usually costs £249. If you weren't already aware, the Xbox Series S includes a compact design, powerful processor and 500GB of storage along with full access to Microsoft's Games Pass.
