Violence erupted on a housing estate in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Footage suggests tempers flared when one woman shouted "You're s****ing my man! F*** off!" A short while later, a woman emerged from a house followed by another person. It is not known whether the people who came out from the house were known to those outside or whether they were just complaining about the loud noise, reports StokeonTrentLive. Footage of the incident shows several people brawling in the road, grappling with each other and falling onto the tarmac. A dog can be heard barking in the background, which no doubt was agitated by all the commotion outside. It is understood that the police spent more than two hours with the victims on Sunday, after they were called out to the scene at around 12.23am.  A Staffordshire police spokesman said: "Police were called to reports of disorder on Conway Street, in Shelton. "It was reported that three teenage girls had assaulted a woman and two teenagers. "Two people were taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital by officers for treatment." The West Midlands Ambulance Service was initially called to the street. An ambulance service spokesman said: "We were called at 12.30am to reports of an incident at an address on Conway Street, in Shelton. "Prior to our arrival, we were stood down by the police as our assistance was no longer required." Police are appealing for any witnesses following the disorder to come forward. They should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 14 of 10 July, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
