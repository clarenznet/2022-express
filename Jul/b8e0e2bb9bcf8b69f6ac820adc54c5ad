Archie Wilks was just four when he caught coronavirus in March 2020 while battling to overcome neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer. The Tottenham Hotspur fan managed to see off Covid a few weeks later. But it took another two years – a total of 42 months of cancer treatment – to reach full remission at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. It was “an amazing and very emotional day” for parents Harriet, 32, and Simon, 34, and his twin brother Henry. Simon, from near Saffron Walden, Essex, added: “There were times when we didn’t see this moment happening. It was an unexplainable experience. He’s so resilient.”
