Princess Beatrice, 33, attended Wimbledon on the same day as Kate Middleton. The Princess of York could scarcely be seen several rows behind the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate was in the royal box, however Beatrice blended in with the crowd. The Duchess could be seen wearing her elegant polka dot tea dress from Alessandra Rich.
