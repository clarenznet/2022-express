Fire season has hit parts of the continent earlier than usual after an exceptionally dry, hot spring. A pilot of a firefighting plane died on Friday when he crashed in the north-east of Portugal. In all, more than 160 people in the country have been injured and hundreds forced to evacuate. Spain is still battling to contain several massive fires, with more than 3,000 people evacuated from villages around the Costa del Sol resort of Mijas. And 11,000 people have been evacuated from threatened areas near Bordeaux, in France.
