The See Monster made landfall at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, yesterday, on a football pitchsized flatbed barge. It will be taken to its new home at the resort - the Tropicana - where Banksy's Dismaland was based.   There it will be transformed for Government art project UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK. The now-decommissioned 450-ton rig aims to start a conversation about repurposing large industrial structures and "design-led solutions to sustainable futures".  Standing at nearly 115ft - 49ft taller than the Angel of the North and just 36ft shy of Nelson's Column - the See Monster will open on August bank holiday weekend. The UNBOXED festival was launched by then prime minister Theresa May in 2018 - and later dubbed the Festival of Brexit by the current EU exit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg.
