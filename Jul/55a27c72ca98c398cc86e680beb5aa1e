Madonna looked almost unrecognisable in a new video posted to her 18.4million followers. The 63-year-old sizzled as she posed in a very low cut black lace corset. She appeared to be using a TikTok filter which distorted her features as she danced around to her song Hung Up. “It’s hot in my room! #finallyenoughlove #hungup,” she wrote, alongside fire emojis.
