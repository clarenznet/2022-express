Rita Ora dazzled in a jewelled dress which showcased her impressive assests as well as flashing her thigh yesterday. She was performing at the opening event of the W Algarve in Albufeira, Portugal, in the garment which hugged her incredible curves. The Poison hitmaker, 31, looked the epitome of glam as she took to the stage in a plunging, v-neck dress which featured a large split up the side. Rita paired the daring number with heeled, black boots and matching black knee-high socks. She put on an energetic performance, flicking her highlighted blonde, wavy tresses over her shoulders as her glitzy eye-make up sparkled.
