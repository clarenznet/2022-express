Freeview is warning customers that TV signals could be affected for multiple days due to the ongoing UK heatwave. As the temperatures could hit a record breaking 40C next week, Freeview is warning that customers could be impacted by signal disruption over the course of five days. However, if Freeview customers do experience problems with their TV reception during the UK heatwave they've been told not - as they'd usually do - to retune their tellies. Freeview said the TV signals they use could be affected by high pressure in some parts of the country between Friday July 15 and Tuesday July 19. And while customers may be tempted to retune their tellies once this hits, Freeview said reception will be restored once the high pressure passes. If you do experience any problems with your Freeview TV signal during the next few days you can simply turn to the internet-powered Freeview Play service instead. You can also download the Freeview app onto your mobile smartphone or tablet to watch Freeview content online.Â You can see full details here.
