As Camilla cooled herself with a green and yellow fan, Charles banged the drum for Europe's biggest street party, which returns for the first time in three years.  He also had a go at the steel variety but admitted: "I'm not much cop at this." The Royal couple were welcomed with a blaze of colour at The Tabernacle, the arts and entertainment centre regarded as the spiritual home of west London's annual celebration of Caribbean culture. The Mangrove steel band played and Charles, 73, shook hands with one of the 12ft high stilt walkers called Moko Jumbies. Enjoying their special preview of the August Bank Holiday's sights and sounds in sizzling summer temperatures, he said: "Hello up there!" The Prince then paused to speak to sculptor Carl Benjamin beside the steel framework of the Queen which appeared at her Platinum Jubilee pageant last month. The Duchess of Cornwall, who turns 75 on Sunday, was congratulated by well-wishers and said: "It all looks pretty good to me." The couple were helping to promote the event, second only to the Rio carnival in scale, in the run-up to next year's 75th anniversary of the arrival of the first group of Caribbean immigrants on the Empire Windrush ship in 1948.
