Adele, 34, appeared to be having a great time as she was pictured on board her luxury yacht with friends and partner Rich Paul. The Hello hitmaker looked radiant as she enjoyed a glass of wine with pals. Adele kept her fashion simple, wearing a black ensemble, while also going make-up free. She styled the black shirt dress with large black sunglasses and statement gold jewellery, including gold hoops and bangles. Meanwhile, Rich went for a statement look with a bright orange shirt and matching shorts. This comes after Adele has been facing severe backlash after she cancelled her Las Vegas residency last minute because the show just "[wasn't] good enough". Following on from two successful concerts in Hyde Park this month, it is claimed she will perform an intimate set of her hits later this year in Nevada.
