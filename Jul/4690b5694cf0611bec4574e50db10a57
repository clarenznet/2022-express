The actor, 58, also wore a pink shirt, biker boots and brown jacket that matched his eye-catching lower-half fashion choice. The red-carpet outfit was for the Berlin premiere of his film Bullet Train, in which five assassins find themselves on the same train from Tokyo to Morioka in north Japan. Sandra Bullock, Joey King and Aaron Taylor-Johnson also star. Pitt is not the first actor to select a skirt for a big event. Moon Knight star Oscar Isaac wore one at the premieres of the Marvel miniseries, both in Berlin and London. Harry Styles, Jared Leto and David Beckham have also been snapped in skirts.
