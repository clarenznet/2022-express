Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios the men's Wimbledon final on Sunday afternoon but the Serbian will drop down the rankings even despite winning a fourth straight showpiece match on Centre Court. Despite winning three of the last six Grand Slams, Djokovic is ranked No 3 in the world and will drop to a four-year low of No 7 after beating Kyrgios at SW19.  That's as a result of the ATP punishment the governing body have inflicted don Wimbledon for banning Russian and Belarusian players from competing. Ranking points have been removed from the tournament and as such Djokovic will drop the 2,000 points he gained for winning at the All England Club in 2021. Djokovic has not been outside of the top six since August 2018 but falls below Stefanos Tsitsipas, Caspar Ruud and Carlos Alcaraz although none of the trio got past the round of 16 at Wimbledon. But he won't care too much as the Serbian got his hands on his 21st Grand Slam on Sunday with a four-set triumph. This year's Wimbledon also served as Sue Barker's last for the BBC after over 30 years presenting their coverage of the grass-court Grand Slam. Tributes poured in for the much-loved broadcaster and ex-tennis player as she did her final show for the Beeb. FOLLOW EXPRESS SPORT'S LIVE WIMBLEDON UPDATES BELOW...
