Hot weather has well and truly arrived in the UK, with today forecast to be the hottest day of the year so far. Forecasters have predicted temperatures could soar to 33C on Monday, making it hotter than Marbella and the Maldives. The Met Office has issued a level three health alert for the east and south east of England today, warning of the potential health impacts of the scorching hot weather. However, that's not deterred some Britons from seeking the sun across the country at beaches and parks.
