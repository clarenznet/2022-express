Amazon is slashing prices in every department as part of its blockbuster Prime Day sale. Some of the best Prime Day deals include price cuts to Apple gadgets, air dryers, Amazon Echo smart speakers, and Nintendo Switch consoles. But that's just a small taste with games, kitchen appliances, clothing, furniture, alcohol and more all available at stunning prices throughout today and tomorrow. Prime Day discounts are only available for Prime members. If you aren't subscribed to the membership scheme, which costs £79 per year, there is some good news. You can sign-up for an Amazon Prime free trial to unlock access to all of the deals across the two-day sale ...and then cancel when your bargain has been delivered for free next day! Even if you've tested out Prime membership in the past, Amazon often allows customers to sign-up for a trial again during the Prime Day period – so it's worth checking if you're eligible here. Below, we've rounded up the latest discounts and deals from the Prime Day sales. If you want to nab one of these deals, you'll need to add it to your basket fast.
