The New Forest in Hampshire - voted the best National Park in Europe - had resisted the "unsightly" bins, with residents calling them an eyesore. But after the Government called for further recycling efforts in the area, 90 percent of the area's homes will now gain the bins after the majority of New Forest district councillors voted for the Â£5.6million scheme.  They will replace separate plastic bags for general waste and recycling, collected once a week. Tory councillor Sue Bennison warned they would make the Forest "like a dustbin area". But fellow Tory Derek Tipp said: "We've got to try to adapt to change. "The main thing people don't like is the appearance, people don't want to see them littering our pavements and I don't too, but we've got to get our recycling rates up." The district was ranked 286 out of 345 councils for recycling in 2018-19.
