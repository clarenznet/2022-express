Lily James looks barely recognisable as she posed up a storm next to fashion mogul Donatella Versace. The Mamma Mia star, 33, stunned as she donned a tight-fitting blood red dress which showcased her phenomenal figure. The garment was complete with intricate corsetry around the midriff which allowed for a glimpse of the star's toned stomach. However, it was her long, black hair which was the most shocking aspect of her transformation. Lily cut a sultry figure with a face of pale make-up, complete with dark-coloured lipstick as she hinted at the upcoming campaign: "This. Is. A. Dream. @donatella_versace love you. Can't wait to share more..." she penned.
