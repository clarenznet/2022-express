Sir Keir Starmer is free and clear following an investigation into a Labour Party gathering in Durham during the Covid pandemic. The leader and his deputy Angela Rayner will not receive fixed penalty notices for drinking beer and eating a curry at the party's Durham headquarters two years ago. Durham Constabulary found they had not broken Covid rules, and that their gathering was a reasonable exception. The police force said in a statement: â€œIt has been concluded that there is no case to answer for a contravention of the regulations, due to the application of an exception, namely reasonably necessary work."
