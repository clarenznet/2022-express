Former Manchester United star Juan Mata is prepared to make some hefty sacrifices in order to complete a move to Leeds United, reports say. The Spaniard is on the lookout for a new club after his contract at Old Trafford expired. Mata might be on the verge of completing a move to Leeds this summer after his contract at United expired. The playmaker is one of a number of illustrious free agents available with his eight-year stint at Old Trafford coming to an end. Several clubs have been linked with the 34-year-old including a return to Spain and a role in the coaching set-up with the Red Devils. But a move to Leeds could be on in a shocking twist of events after Whites transfer chief Victor Orta made a personal plea to the former Chelsea star. According to Marca, via Sport Witness, talks are already underway over a potential deal. However, it will require Mata to significantly lower his wages that he made at Old Trafford as his old salary would be too much for Leeds to match. But it is good news with the player willing to do so to push through a move to Elland Road. Raphinha is set to join Barcelona despite interest from Chelsea and Arsenal but the deal leaves Leeds light on forward options. The Brazilian was an integral part of the squad while they only narrowly avoided relegation last season. The loss of Kalvin Phillips to Manchester City has also had a huge impact while Jesse Marsch has been keen to bolster the team with the funds handed to them. One of them includes Mata, but the Whites are not the only side interested in the former Spain international. Real Betis are also locked in talks with the midfielder and his father, who acts as his agent. A return to Spain does appeal to the Burgos-born star but sticking around in the Premier League is also high on his wish list. Leeds have been splashing the cash this summer as they look to avoid another relegation dogfight. They include Brenden Aaronson, Luis Sinisterra, Tyler Adams, Rasmus Kristensen and Marc Roca.
