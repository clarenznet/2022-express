Then, in 2018, his mother Caroline tried CBD oil, which can legally be bought as a food supplement from health stores and contains tiny amounts of THC, the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis. Caroline, 49, said: "For two years Mitchell was a different child, going to school and living his best life." But when the CBD oil stopped working, Caroline found it impossible to get cannabis oil containing a higher level of THC on prescription. Imported cannabis oils were approved for NHS use four years ago, but have so far only been given to three children in the UK. In desperation Caroline, from Camelford, Cornwall, accepted an offer of free homemade cannabis oil from a friend who grew the plants for their own pain relief. Caroline said: "Mitchell was by now having 10 seizures a day and banging his head. He was getting very depressed." The oil saw his seizures drop to two or three a month. But recently Mitchell's social workers, who provide support for his autism, found out about the oil and reported Caroline to the police. She was told to "wean" Mitchell off the cannabis oil - but as soon as she did his seizures started again. Two detectives called at the family home last Thursday and Caroline fears she is going to be prosecuted.
