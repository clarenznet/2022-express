Novak Djokovic has looked unstoppable in the last few rounds at Wimbledon, but faces his toughest test to date against the in-form Tim van Rijthoven. The Dutchman pulled off a huge upset in the build-up to Wimbledon when he beat both Felix Auger-Aliassime and Daniil Medvedev on his way to at S-Hertogenbosch for his maiden ATP Tour title. The 25-year-old has carried that form into Wimbledon in reaching the fourth round for the first time in his career. It's the first time he's even made the main draw of a major and has been rewarded with an evening Centre Court clash with No 1 seed Djokovic. The Serbian looked shaky in his first-round match against Soonwoo Kwon, but has looked anything but since then. He thrashed both Thanasi Kokkinakis and Miomir Kecmanovic to reach the fourth round as he builds up momentum towards a bid for his seventh Wimbledon title. Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz awaits in the quarter finals for the winner. Follow Express Sport's live blog from Djokovic's match with VanÂ Rijthoven below
