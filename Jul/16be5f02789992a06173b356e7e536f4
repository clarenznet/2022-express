Boris Johnson has had a gruelling few months, fending off attacks from Labour and Sir Keir Starmer, as well as his own Conservative MPs. Calls to resign are coming thick and fast as Tory Party scandals mount up, and Labour’s lead in the national polls has continued to hold. Mr Johnson could be replaced in the event of a general election - giving Mr Starmer the chance to enter Downing Street if Labour wins. Tory MPs could also try to remove the Prime Minister themselves and appoint a new leader from their party, a move that could turn around their fortunes. Jeremy Hunt and Penny Mordaunt are favourites with the bookies right now to be next Tory leader, at 6/1 with Ladbrokes. Liz Truss is just behind at 7/1, Ben Wallace and Tom Tugendhat are next at 8/1, and Nadhim Zahawi and Rishi Sunak are thought to be outsiders at 10/1. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: “Penny Mordaunt has established herself as a firm frontrunner in the race to replace Boris Johnson over the last few weeks, overtaking the likes of Liz Truss and Tom Tugendhat in the process.” Betfair Exchange is backing Jeremy Hunt as the favourite offering odds of 13/2, and 7/1 for Penny Mordaunt. Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: “Boris Johnson’s position is once again under threat amid claims he knew about Chris Pincher’s alleged sexual misconduct. As a result, Johnson is now 8/5 to leave his role as Prime Minister this year. Looking at who could replace him as Tory leader, Jeremy Hunt is the 13/2 favourite, followed by Penny Mordaunt at 7/1 and Liz Truss, who is 8/1.” So, who do you want as the next prime minister if Boris gets the boot?
