A Place in the Sun star Danni Menzies, 33, has been enjoying a sun-soaked holiday, making her fans envious with several stunning snaps in a scenic Ibiza location. She made her final day count as she posed up a storm in a tiny pair of bikini bottoms - having whipped off the top. The presenter posed topless as she marked her “last day in paradise”, showing off her incredible figure as she stood on a balcony overlooking the ocean. Another stunning photo showed Danni in a mint green slip dress while watching the sunset, sipping on what looks like white wine and looking thoughtfully towards the horizon.
