Halimah Kyrgios enjoyed a night of champagne as she partied the night away with her brother Nick Kyrgios following his Wimbledon loss. The sister of the tennis player opted for a bargain blue buttoned-up ruched mini dress from Primark for the extravagant bash. She posted several videos from London's Wyld as she celebrated with her brother and his girlfriend, Costeen Hatzi. Costeen took to her Instagram to share videos from the wild party, with Costeen branding Halimah a "bad influence" as she held up bottles of tequila and vodka. As well as losing against Novak Djokovic, Kygrios came under scrutiny for wearing a red baseball cap during the games. Wimbledon's strict dress code stipulates that white must be worn "from the point at which the player enters the court".
