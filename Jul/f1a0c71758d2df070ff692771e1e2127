Carol Vorderman, 61, looked sensational today as she wore a dress she had not worn “since the 80’s” to host Lorraine this morning.

Carol typed: “A pop of orange and a puff sleeve not seen since the 80s this morning on @lorraine. “A comfy frock in the heat from @CoastFashion. “Lorraine will be back in her chair as soon as all the covid tests do their thing. And we're all wishing her well ASAP. “Meanwhile you're stuck with the deputy to the Deputy to the Boss this week...that's me. “See you tomoz at 9am x.”
