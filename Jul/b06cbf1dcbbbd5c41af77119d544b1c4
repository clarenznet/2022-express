Genetic defects are the cause of ­half of all heart transplants and are ­the ­leading cause of heart death in young people. The new procedure involves injecting a healthy version of the faulty gene ­into a patient’s arm to enable the ­production of proteins that result in normal heart function. The CureHeart group is behind ­the treatment, having been granted £30million from the British Heart Foundation to perfect its technology. CureHeart project lead Professor Hugh Watkins, of Oxford University, said: “This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to relieve families of the constant worry of sudden death, heart failure and potential need for a heart transplant." “After 30 years of research, we have discovered many of the genes ­­and specific genetic faults responsible for different cardiomyopathies, and ­how they work." “We believe that we will have a gene therapy ready to start testing in clinical trials in the next five years." “This absolutely is something that will work in the end, it’s just a question of time.” Every week in the UK, 12 people under the age of 35 die of an ­undiagnosed heart condition, very ­often caused by an inherited heart ­muscle disease. Junior football star Daniel Yorath, 15, was having a kickabout with father Terry, the former Wales and Leeds United legend, in their back garden in 1992 when he collapsed and died. A post-mortem examination revealed Daniel had a disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart ­to pump blood.
