Six fire crews dashed to the scene - a business premises in Longport, Stoke-on-Trent, at around 10.45pm - after nearby residents raised the alarm. Many shared concerns gas canisters had exploded as they saw and heard "popping and bangs". One resident said: "There is a massive fire on Chemical Lane. There is popping and bangs happening around Burslem and Middleport. Gas canisters are going up in the air and exploding." Photographs and video published by Stoke-on-Trent Live show thick black smoke pouring into the air with high flames. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service has not yet released any further details regarding the incident. It had tweeted last night: "Staffordshire Fire have 6 pumps in attendance at a factory fire on Chemical Lane." It later described it as a "large factory fire."   The same service also last night battled a fire in Kings Bromley, near Lichfield, said to have involved a standing crop. "In addition to the large factory fire in Longport, crews from Barton under Needwood, Lichfield and Rugeley are in attendance at a large fire involving standing crop at a farm in Kings Bromley," a further tweet read. The emergencies come after around 100 firefighters rushed to Brixton Market in south London, after a huge fire broke out, leading to the area being evacuated. A three-storey warehouse on Electric Lane yesterday caught alight, said to be used to store items for the adjacent market. London Fire Brigade said 53 people had called 999 to report the blaze, with the first alert coming through at 8.58pm. Fire crews from Clapham, West Norwood, Peckham, Old Kent Road, Chelsea and surrounding fire stations are at the scene, with 15 fire engines. Surrounding roads were closed as emergency services battled the fire in a narrow alley.
