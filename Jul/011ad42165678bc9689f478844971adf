The former EastEnders actor, who played Vincent Hubbard until 2018, joined Simon Rimmer and Tim Lovejoy on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch, where he talked about his Hollyoaks role and how it differed to being in EastEnders. The 50-year-old reflected that although he enjoyed his time on the BBC soap, Hollyoaks has "less of a hierarchy."  "The Hollyoaks team... It's just a real family basically," he told Tim and Simon. He continued: "There's no hierarchies, no egos, and everybody wants to help everybody - it's a great vibe." "Is that not the norm though?" Simon probed. "Because I always imagine EastEnders must have been like that as well." "EastEnders is like that," Richard replied, before pausing.

"I don't tolerate disrespect, it's true I don't. So anywhere I work, I carry myself a certain way. "But there's more hierarchy in EastEnders than there is Hollyoaks." He quickly added: "But everybody in EastEnders was lovely to me. "They were a family and I see them still, I saw them the other day at the TRIC Awards. "Diane (Parish) and everyone, and we were just hugging, all of us were hugging. "Because you're in this compound, whether it's EastEnders or Hollyoaks, you're in this compound and you're in there from morning until late evening. "And the next day you're there again, so you see more of them than you see your own family." DON'T MISS...
