The Crush star, 45, branded the Natalie and Tessa Mae Thompson's Clueless-inspired outfits "stunning" in view of her 1.9 million followers. She added: "You both look amazing," while tagging the actresses. In the snap, Natalie donned a black and yellow plaid patterned skirt and blazer with a black bandeau top underneath which flashed her toned midriff.
