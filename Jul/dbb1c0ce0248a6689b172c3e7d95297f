Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak have both resigned tonight, leaving Prime Minister Boris Johnson in very rocky territory. The two high-profile politicians touted "standards" and the "tone set as leader" as to why they quit. Mr Sunak wrote: "I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning." While Mr Javid said: "The tone you set as leader, and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party and ultimately the country. "Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision makers, guided by strong values. We may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. "Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither." Who would you like to see as the next Prime Minister? Have your say in the comments below.
