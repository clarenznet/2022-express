Boris Johnson currently lives at 11 Downing Street. However, today he appeared near his home to announce his resignation. When he is no longer Prime Minister, Johnson will need to move out of the property. This is because the home is only for the leader of the country. He currently lives there with his wife, Carrie Johnson, and their two children. The PM has not confirmed exactly where he will move to.

Boris lived in a flat in Camberwell, London, before taking on his leading role. This is somewhere he may move back. It is likely the family will stay in London as Boris expressed his wishes to continue in a political role.  If they do not return to the flat, Boris and Carrie may choose a larger property in London as they now have two children. Boris also has family who live in various locations across London and may consider moving closer to them. Carrie grew up in South-West London and her hometown could also be another option. The family may also opt to move somewhere that is within commuting distance. READ MORE: Paint: ‘Dull and unappealing’ colours to avoid when decorating A potential option outside of London is Oxford. Boris previously lived in a country home in North Weston, Oxfordshire. This area is roughly two hours outside of central London. The four bedroom country property, known as The Old Farm House, has 2,659 square feet of space inside. While it appears to still be owned by the PM, it is currently being rented out so may not be an obvious option for the Johnsons. Boris announced his resignation in a speech today after a string of his MPs resigned. It is thought he will stay in power until October, giving him a few months to find a new pad.
