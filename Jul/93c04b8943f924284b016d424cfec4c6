The chef revealed that pasta fans should be using about 10 grams of salt for every litre of water." Gennaro demonstrated with 100 grams of pasta. His pasta of choice? Spaghetti. Before placing the pasta into the water, Gennaro explained that the water should already be "very vicious".

Fresh pasta, on the other hand, only takes a couple of minutes. But regardless of whether the pasta is dry or fresh, exactly the same amount of water and salt must be used for cooking it. He said: "Then you will have a happy pasta." Next up is the taste test. Referring to his culinary creation, Gennaro said: "Perfect. Al dente means it's just a little bit undercooked." The result of this is that you are chewing the pasta longer and tasting it better, not to mention digesting it better, according to the chef. The salt added to the water at the beginning of the process will later complement the sauce when added - for a taste that made Gennaro exclaim "hallelujah".
