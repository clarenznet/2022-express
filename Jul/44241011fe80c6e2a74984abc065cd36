Sue Barker, 66, previously announced this would be her final time covering Wimbledon on Sunday after 30 years in the job. The former French Open champion first joined the BBCâ€™s coverage in 1993 and has become a household name, having also presented A Question of Sport for 24 years. Sue opted for a summer look as she sported a fitted white skirt teamed with a black blazer and open-toe sandals. The former Question of Sport presenter was all smiles as she posed for pictures ahead of the Wimbledon's Mens Final between Novak Djokovic and Nick Kyrgios.
