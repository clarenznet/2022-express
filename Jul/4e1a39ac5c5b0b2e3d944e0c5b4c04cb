During hustings in Leeds last night, Mr Sunak said there doesn't need to be a border between Britain and Northern Ireland nor a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Tory leadership hopeful added that new legislation to rip up parts of the Northern Ireland protocol will fix the problems caused by the Brexit deal. The EU is seeing the UK over the legislation as it claims it goes against international law. Mr Sunak's plans have been heavily criticised. Writing on Twitter, @g_gosden said: "Sunak says he wants completely open borders between Britain, Northern Ireland and the EU, and would achieve it via a Northern Ireland bill that the EU is already suing us over. "Completely bonkers unless we join the customs union and/or the S. Market." Financial Times public policy editor Peter Foster added: "Wow. The abysmal state of this from @rishisunak who presumably knows heâ€™s talking tosh. Which is the problem." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
