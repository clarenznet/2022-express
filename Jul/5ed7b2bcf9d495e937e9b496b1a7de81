Two of the three lanes are closed between J14 and J15, with vehicles queueing for miles on the carriageway. The vehicle fire broke out at around 2.30 am today, however, the incident is yet to be cleared as lanes 1 and 2 remain closed. Fire and Rescue Service crews rushed to the scene at the time of the accident and the road was blocked completely. National Highways urged motorists to avoid the road and find alternative routes. In an update at the time, they said: "Traffic is currently stopped on the #M4 westbound in #Wiltshire between J14 and J15 due to a vehicle fire. "Emergency services are in attendance. There are 30 minute delays on approach, please allow extra time and consider an alternative route if possible." It is not yet clear if anyone was injured in the accident. In pictures shared by National Highways, the lorry appears severely damaged by the fire. Motorists that passed by were shocked in view of the blaze, with someone with the Twitter handle @gard_d_nerian commenting on the post: "Went pass that when it was well and truly ablaze, I was eastbound and the heat was intense. Glad no one hurt". Traffic officers opened lane 3 a few minutes after 3am although the Fire and Rescue Service remained in attendance until after 5am. At 8am, queues of about three miles and delays of about 30 minutes were ongoing.
