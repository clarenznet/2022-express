Mr Sunak came out on top again with 115 votes, just below the 120 vote threshold needed to see him through to the final two. Meanwhile, Ms Mordaunt remained in second place with 82 votes, despite dropping one since the second-round ballot. Ms Truss came in third with 71 votes, gaining seven votes this time around. Ms Badenoch received 58 votes, gaining nine supporters. MPs will vote again on Tuesday and Wednesday as the pool is whittled down to two. Former Chancellor Mr Sunak’s popularity slumped leading up to his resignation, and he faced criticism for his handling of the cost of living crisis. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss has been backed by many Brexiteers and those who remained loyal to Boris Johnson. She has kickstarted her campaign with severe tax-cutting commitments, including scrapping the national insurance rise. Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt has grown her campaign on her Brexit-supporting credentials and built a reputation for being a low-tax Conservative. She has been in Parliament since 2010 and is now taking her position as a frontrunner for the top role. Ms Badenoch is popular among right-wing Tory MPs and is known for being “anti-woke”. She has proved popular with younger MPs and was given a boost from former Levelling-up Secretary Michael Gove. Tory MPs will vote again on Tuesday, July 19 from 1pm to 3pm to whittle the race down to just two candidates.
