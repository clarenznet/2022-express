Hugh Chater, the chief commercial officer at Virgin Money, cited recent developments in the UK economy as to why the bank is taking action now. Mr Chater explained: “Following the Bank of England’s base rate increase in June, our new market-leading rate gives consumers more reasons to bank with Virgin Money and rewards our existing customers. “This boost to our linked savings rates means we can offer both new and existing customers even better value for their savings, which is so important in these challenging times.” DON'T MISS THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS STORY ...
