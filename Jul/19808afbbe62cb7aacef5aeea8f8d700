The Pixel A range has long been a way to pick up a first-party Google device at a great price. This year's version of the budget line, the Pixel 6a, is available for pre-orders right now ahead of a July 28 release date and is priced at £399. But you may want to get last year's flagship instead, as the Pixel 6 is currently available for £449 thanks to a mega-money saving deal with Amazon. In the run-up to Prime Day 2022 the online retail giant has slashed the Pixel 6 price by £150, with the 2021 Google flagship usually costing £599. If you have enough wiggle room in your budget to spend £50 more to get a Pixel 6 instead of a 6a there are plenty of reasons to do so. When comparing the two handsets the Pixel 6 bests the Pixel 6a's spec sheet in virtually every department. The Pixel 6 has a larger screen than the 6a (6.4inch to 6.1inch) as well as a better refresh rate (90Hz compared to 60Hz). The Pixel 6 also has more RAM (8GB compared to 6GB), a larger battery and a better rear camera set-up. If fast charging is important to you, then the Pixel 6 is the handset for you as well as the Pixel 6a doesn't support this. Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6a have parity in one area, with these two handsets fitted with the Tensor chip. This is the first ever custom made silicon from Google which offers big AI improvements to the Pixel range. While the Pixel 6a is also a smaller and lighter handset than the Pixel 6, due to its smaller screen size, if that is a factor for you when purchasing a handset. If you'd rather pick up a Pixel 6 with a contract then Mobiles.co.uk are also running deals on the Google handset, with up to £150 cashback available as well as savings on contracts. Besides the Pixel 6, there are other handsets and Made By Google products available right now that have received a big price cut.
