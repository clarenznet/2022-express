The document from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists details best practice for pregnancies in transgender men. It also proposes overhauls of cancer screening, childbirth and fertility treatments to make them more inclusive. A transgender man is assigned as female at birth but now identifies as a male, though he may have female genitalia enabling childbirth. Gynaecological oncologist Phil Rolland, who helped to draft the guidance, said: “Trans people are more likely to have poor experiences when accessing healthcare, and we can do better.”
