Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles wowed at the opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games. The 75-year-old Duchess turned heads in a navy and white jumpsuit from Anna Valentine with black kitten heels. The couple drove into the opening ceremony in the Prince of Wales's Aston Martin car, famously run on red wine and cheese for sustainability, which he bought back in 1970. According to Richard Palmer, the royal correspondent at the Daily Express, the car Charles and Camilla arrived in, is the same car driven by Prince William on his wedding day. Camilla has chosen to re-wear her Anna Valentine jumpsuit. The last time the Duchess wore this jumpsuit was on her royal tour to New Zealand in 2019.
