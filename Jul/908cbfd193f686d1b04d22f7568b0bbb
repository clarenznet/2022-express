"Meaningful innovations go beyond the technical and provide a platform upon which our everyday lives become richer and more versatile — opening us up to greater possibilities than ever before." It's almost certain that Samsung will reveal new Galaxy Z Fold and Flip devices during Unpacked with some reports suggesting that the firm has now managed to design a flexible display that doesn't feature a crease once opened.
