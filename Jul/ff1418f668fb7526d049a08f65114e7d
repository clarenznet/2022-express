Many will be shocked to discover exactly how much they have to pay HMRC. The bill could run into tens of thousands of pounds, destroying retirement plans. Yet the damage can be greatly reduced with planning, says Stephen Lowe, director at retirement specialist Just Group.  Savers are free to draw money down from their pension once they reach age 55, but withdrawals are added to your total earnings for that year and liable for income tax. Those who take large sums risk being pushed into a higher tax bracket and handing over more than they expect to HMRC. This is a risk when cashing in a pension or setting up a drawdown plan, where you leave your pot invested but make regular withdrawals to fund spending. Many don’t realise the danger and pay a high price. Generating enough pension income to enjoy retirement as living costs surge is already hard enough. It gets even harder with the taxman waiting to pounce on every mistake. This is how the HMRC tax attack works in practice. A 66-year-old living on just £9,267.80 a year from the new State Pension pays no income tax because their income is below the £12,570 personal allowance. That could change if they withdrew money from a company or personal pension. Say they took £8,000 from one of their pots. This would lift their total income for the year to £17,627.80. They can take 25 percent of that withdrawal tax free, worth £2,000 (assuming they haven’t already taken their tax-free cash). HMRC would add the remaining £6,000 to their earnings, giving them income of £15,627.80 a year. Of this, £3,057.80 would fall above the personal allowance and be taxable at 20 percent. Instead of paying no income tax that year, the pensioner would hand over £611.56 to HMRC. That's tough at a time when every penny counts. As they have reached State Pension age, they do not have to pay National Insurance, otherwise the bill would be higher. Others could pay a lot more.

If they also cashed in a £50,000 pension, after the 25 percent tax-free cash their taxable income would increase by £37,500. The first £20,270 of that would be subject to 20 percent tax totalling £4,054. The remaining £17,230 would incur 40 percent tax of £6,892. There is no NI to pay on pension withdrawals but they would still hand a staggering £10,946 to HMRC, a fifth of their pension pot. That's on top of income tax and NI on their earnings. In total, they will pay a hefty £16,830.59. With careful planning, they can slash that bill, Lowe says.

This would save them almost £3,500 in tax. HMRC would still get its pound of flesh, roughly £7,446, but that's a lot less. Lowe says spreading pension withdrawals in this way would cause little hardship. "It could mean waiting from April 5, the last day of one tax year, to April 6, the first of the new one.” Everybody's situation is different. Some could save more tax, others less. Lowe says pension withdrawals are a minefield. “You must think about the tax consequences before making any withdrawal.” Things are further complicated by the fact that the first withdrawal from a pension is often subject to emergency tax, which can be reclaimed. Lowe adds: “That’s why we are such strong advocates of taking the free impartial and independent guidance on offer from Pension Wise or paying for professional regulated advice."
