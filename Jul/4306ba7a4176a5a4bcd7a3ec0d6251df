Geri Halliwell, 49, looked amazing as she posted a selfie with former Spice Girls bandmate Mel C. The pair were watching England vs Germany at Wembley Stadium in the Euros Women's finale. Geri looked very youthful in white and wore her hair in a light wave, similar to Mel C. This comes as Geri's husband Christian Horner, 48, is currently celebrating after winning the Hungarian Grand Prix with Max Verstappen. Verstappen won despite a spin costing the lead, with the driver even passing rival Charles Leclerc twice.
