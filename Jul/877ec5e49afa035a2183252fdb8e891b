Piers Morgan, 57, posted a photo of himself behind the scenes of his TalkTV show Uncensored, with three attractive women alongside him. However some of his followers were enraged, believing the photo call was "sexist" and "pathetic", while others quizzed whether he would end up posting bikini-clad girls in a bid to boost his ratings. "Piers’s Uncensored Angels," the broadcaster captioned the photo, before tagging team members Isabel Oakeshott, who is the international editor for TalkTV, plus political editor Kate McCann and journalist Emily Sheffield. He added three fire emojis to punctuate his point - but some felt they were being treated more like Victoria's Secret Angels on the catwalk than as serious employees, and they weren't afraid to take to Twitter to say so. @Macros0611 remarked scathingly: "I’m sure they’ll eventually look back at this as a low point in their careers." Meanwhile @juniejunis blasted: "What century are you in?", questioning: "Is this the 80s?"

The TalkTV star never returned to the show after his outburst, which was criticised by viewers as Meghan had talked about struggling with depression, while being branded a "liar" by Piers. Now it seems he has raised hackles with his depiction of his trio of "angels". However Piers has often spoken against sexism, previously claiming that ITV show Loose Women is sexist, and defending former colleague Susanna Reid against a "sexist" backlash for flirting"? So far, Piers is keeping his silence and has not publicly responded to those of his 7.9 million followers who took issue with him.
