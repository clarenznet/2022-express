Scientists believe limiting food intake to a maximum 10-hour window was found to improve metabolism. Time-restricted eating (TRE) has become trendy, even for those who don't have diabetes.  Author Professor Patrick Schrauwen of Maastricht University said: "A 10-hour TRE regimen for three weeks decreases glucose levels. "And it prolongs the time spent in the normal blood sugar range in adults with Type 2, compared with spreading intake over 14 hours."
