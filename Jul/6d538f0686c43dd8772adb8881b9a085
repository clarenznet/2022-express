The Duke of Sussex's current campaign - arguing he should be assigned police protection in Britain - is at risk of splitting into a second lawsuit. If the second lawsuit is successful, it could set the precedent that would allow a flood of new claims by the rich and famous. After abandoning their royal duties in 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were stripped of their tax-payer funded police bodyguards due to a decision made by the Home Office's Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC). Speaking to Newsweek, Amber Melville-Brown, of international law firm Withers, said: "If Harry were successful in a judicial review which sought to fight his own private, security corner, it might leave the door ajar for others—the devil will be in the detail of the claim and the court's ultimate ruling." "The remit of Prince Harry's anticipated new Judicial Review is as yet unknown, but if it is as wide as forecast in his current claim—'to determine in principle whether an individual whose position had been determined by RAVEC not to justify Protective Security should be permitted to receive Protective Security but to reimburse the public purse for the cost of that security'—some will fear a win for Harry risks turning the West End, Westminster and the West Country into the Wild West. "Currently, State security is not available on a privately funded basis—but a change in the rules, if it applied to any 'individual' who did not justify private security, could theoretically enable those with the will and the wherewithal to pay privately for protection, leading to armed entourages accompanying them as they toured around the British Isles."
