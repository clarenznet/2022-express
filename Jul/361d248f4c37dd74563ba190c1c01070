Data from the Office for National Statistics, gathered between June 22 and July 3, has revealed that 49 percent of people said there is less in their shopping trolleys at the moment. In the previous survey, between June 8 and June 19, only 43 percent of adults said that they were picking up fewer grocery items. Some 91 percent also reported that their cost of living had risen over the past month, the same share as the prior survey. The ONS also found that the percentage of people with fears about Covid grew between the two surveys, rising from 41 to 49 percent. They also noted that 39 percent were worried about the impact of the pandemic on their lives, up from 32 percent. But many more were concerned about the cost of living in general (78 percent) and the war in Ukraine (77 percent).
