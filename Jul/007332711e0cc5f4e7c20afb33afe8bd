Rafael Nadal breezed into the fourth round at Wimbledon after securing a comfortable win over Italian hopeful Lorenzo Sonego on Saturday evening. The Spaniard went into the match as the overwhelming favourite to emerge victorious and did not disappoint with a stunning performance on Centre Court to maintain his dreams of achieving the fabled Calendar Slam this year. Nadal managed to establish his dominance on proceedings from the word go, with the 36-year-old racing into the lead by claiming the first set after just 27 minutes. He went on to tighten his grip on the contest by doubling his advantage in set two, with Sonego being left simply unable to provide any answers to the questions being asked of him by Nadal. Sonego went on to fight back with a vengeance in the third set, leaving Nadal rattled after badgering the umpire to close the roof as a result of the fading natural light in SW19. The latter managed to recover well, though, to wrap up what was ultimately a straightforward victory over his younger opponent in straight sets. Express Sport is on hand for live updates.
