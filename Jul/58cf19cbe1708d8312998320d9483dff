F1 is back with the best drivers in the world heading to France for the latest round of the 2022 season. Going into this race reigning champ Max Verstappen leads the world standings from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who won last time out in Red Bull's backyard in Austria. While an upgrade Mercedes brought to France was hoped to revive the fortunes of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell this weekend. Sir Lewis ended up qualifying fourth, but was still far off the pace of the leading Ferraris and Red Bulls - with Leclerc and Verstappen once again sharing the front row today. As always, Sky is the place where you can watch every second of today's race exclusively live. But if you’re heading overseas or already abroad on holiday, the Sky Go app - which lets you tune into Sky programming live on your phone or tablet - isn’t available to access as its geo-restricted. But don’t worry, there’s a simple trick to use to stream Sky Go from outside of the UK. The solution is to use a VPN - if you've never used one before here is how you can watch the F1 and Sky channels abroad. A VPN is a simple tool you can download and what it does is makes it seem you’re using an IP address in a different country so that you can be free from any content-restricting issues. Here are a few simple steps on how to use a VPN to watch the F1... - Download a VPN, with two standout options being ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Access these on your phone, laptop, tablet or whatever streaming device you prefer to use. - When you’re in the VPN’s interface, make sure to choose a UK server. - Go to Sky Go and choose to watch Sky F1. - Watch all the action from the F1 race, with coverage starting at 12.30pm and lights out at 2pm.
