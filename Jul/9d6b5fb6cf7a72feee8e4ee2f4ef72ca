A recent Express.co.uk poll found that 94 percent of readers believe Prince Andrew should not push for a royal return, while 85 percent believe he should be kicked out of Windsor Castle. It comes a month after the Duke of York’s plan to return to a public-facing role was scuppered as he was banned from attending the public elements of Garter Day, an annual event which sees the Order of the Garter ceremony, where the Queen and Knights parade in grand velvet robes. As a Knight of the Garter, Andrew would have usually taken part in all aspects of the traditional ceremony, but following a last-minute intervention by his older brother Prince Charles, and nephew Prince William, he was only permitted to attend the private elements. Andrew was originally cleared to take part in the whole ceremony, suggesting that both he and the Queen thought it was a good idea to allow the disgraced royal back into the public light.However, Charles and William reportedly expressed their disapproval over the initial plans, meaning an 11th-hour decision stopped Andrew in his tracks.The Duke, who has kept a low profile since reaching an an out-of-court settlement in his civil sexual assault brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, was then prevented from attending the festivities at Royal Ascot. The settlement, which was agreed in February, was not an admission of guilt. Andrew has vehemently denied all allegations against him. Now, a royal expert has claimed that Andrew is “enraged at the meddling of the Queen's heirs,” and his relationship with his older brother is “virtually non-existent”.

He wrote: “It’s reported that the Queen sees Andrew as her 'favourite' son, and something he has played up to quite a lot despite Prince Charles having the higher public role.“It always infuriated Charles that Andrew could do no wrong in the eyes of his mother who had more time for him simply because she had grown into her role by the time Andrew had arrived.“Charles has had to simply work harder he feels than ever as Andrew was known back in the day as the fun-loving party prince, good-looking and always seen with the right people at all the hottest spots plus endless model girlfriends, while Charles always appeared more sour and dour by comparison.”Andrew’s close relationship with his mother remains, with the prince said to be one of the Queen’s most frequent visitors. And previous events suggest that the monarch shares Andrew’s desire for him to return to public life; Prince Philip’s memorial service at the end of March saw the Duke of York escort the 96-year-old Sovereign into Westminster Abbey.

If York insisted on taking part publicly, he would withdraw.” Mr Sean said: “Brothers at war — Charles and Andrew no longer speaking, and yet William eyeing up the future without Andrew in the frame for any kind of role in public at least.
