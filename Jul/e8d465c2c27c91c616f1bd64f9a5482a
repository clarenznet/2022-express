Officials in Lviv, a major city in western Ukraine, called an operational meeting with military and civilian authorities to begin preparing for an attack from Belarus as Russia continues its blitz in the east. Volodymyr Zelensky's government has said Belarus has already begun attacks against his country last week. Speaking last week, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence said: "This is the first case of an air strike across Ukraine directly from the territory of Belarus. Today's shelling is directly related to the efforts of the Kremlin authorities to drag Belarus into the war in Ukraine as a direct participant." Belarusian forces are currently holding military drills which will continue into July. The grim warning comes after Russia announced it had taken full occupation of Severodonetsk in the eastern Luhansk region and has now escalated fighting in nearby Lysychansk, which is a few miles away and south of the Siverskyi Donets River.
