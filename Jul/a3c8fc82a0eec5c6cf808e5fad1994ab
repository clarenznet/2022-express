Kate Hudson, who is the daughter of Goldie Hawn, opted to bare all as she went topless for a morning selfie in a candid snap yesterday. The 43-year-old posed beside a large window wearing nothing but her underwear while her blonde tresses covered her assets as she drank a cup of tea. The photo, which was taken in London, went down a storm with the actress' followers but her brother Oliver Hudson appeared less than impressed. In view of her 15.4 million followers, Kate captioned the post: "[Sun emoji] out. [Cup of tea emoji]." Oliver took to the comment section and cheekily replied: "Nope."
