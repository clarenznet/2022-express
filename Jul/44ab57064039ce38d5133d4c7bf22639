David Beckham showed off for the video footage, flipping around with a broad grin on his face as he tried his hand at being a dance extraordinaire. Fashionista wife Victoria uploaded it to Instagram, with the quote: "After 25 years @davidbeckham showed me his worm x". However the caption appeared to mortify a virtually red-faced Romeo, who demanded: "mum u gotta change that caption!" Meanwhile hundreds of other Instagrammers shared his laughter emojis, adding in some of their own. Sam McKnight also waded into the embarrassing moment, quipping in front of Victoria's 30.2 million followers: "I’d imagine you’ve seen it at least 4 times before….."
