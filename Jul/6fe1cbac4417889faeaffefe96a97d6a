Ulrika Jonsson, 54, looked fantastic as she stripped off while struggling to cover her modesty with only an apron in a new social media post. The TV presenter wore the comfortable outfit as temperatures in the UK surpassed 40 degrees Celsius in a record breaking heatwave. In view of her 196,000 Instagram followers, the Swedish TV star simply captioned the sultry shot: “#nakedgirlsinaprons.” Ulrika accessorised the minimal kitchen-inspired ensemble with some dainty jewellery, including a number of fine gold necklaces.
