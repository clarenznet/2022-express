Tiger Woods failed to make the cut for what could be his final ever appearance at St Andrews as he welled up on Friday after finishing nine over par after two rounds. The 46-year-old is not planning to hang up his club just yet but the British Open will not return to the famous St Andrews course again until 2030. Australian Cameron Smith has set the pace early on but American Cameron Young will start day three only two shots behind on 11 under par. Brit Rory McIlroy is among the front runners at 10 under par, meaning he will tee off in the penultimate group on Saturday.
