The national broadcaster is perpetuating the warped priorities of the celebrity culture, while it continues to send out its enforcers to terrorise vulnerable older people into stumping up £159 per year to pay for the BBC’s excessive salaries.  The TV licence fee is a regressive tax as it hits the poorest the hardest. Just like the poll tax which brought down the Thatcher Government. I urge all the leadership contenders in the Tory PM contest to state where they stand on the future of the licence fee. If there is to be a continuation of a TV tax then it must be reformed radically so that those with the most, pay the most. And the hard-won benefit of free licences for the over 75s must be reinstated, as promised in a previousConservative Party Manifesto. Despite an unofficial BBC prosecution amnesty for the over 75s, Silver Voices members are still getting red-topped notices threatening investigations and doorstep interviews “under caution.” Millions of older people survive on a state pension of £142 a week, compared to Gary Lineker’s weekly £26,000. BBC Executives seem insulated from the real-world cost-of-living crisis, where heating and eating are a bigger priority than watching smarmy presenters. Dennis Reed is director of Silver Voices, the independent organisation for UK senior citizens.
