The Duchess of Sussex is being sued by her half-sister Samantha who alleges that Meghan lied when she described how she "grew up as an only child". Meghan's lawyers have argued the details cannot be false because it is a “textbook example of a subjective statement about how a person feels about her childhood”. Samantha claims she told “false and malicious lies” about her "rags-to-royalty" upbringing and is seeking $75,000 (£57,000) in damages over the Sussexes’ Oprah interview and Finding Freedom biography that she claimed subjected her to “humiliation, shame and hatred on a worldwide scale”. In the latest submission to the court, Meghan’s team argue she also cannot be sued over Finding Freedom because she did not write it. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
