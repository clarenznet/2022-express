Ana de Armas stunned in a school-uniform inspired outfit as she stepped out in London today. The Hollywood actress, 34, looked incredible in the Louis Vuitton get-up as she promoted her new film, The Gray Man. Taking no notice of the heatwave, Cuban born Ana was fully decked out in a navy blazer and matching knee-length skirt. She added a white shirt and emerald green tie, and completed her academic-inspired look with a pair of heeled ankle boots. The Deep Water actress wore her chestnut tresses in soft waves which fell around her shoulders, alongside a soft-glam make-up look.
