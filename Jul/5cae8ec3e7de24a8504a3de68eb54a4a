Summer has finally arrived and as temperatures rise and the sun makes an appearance, there's no better time to get your garden prepped and ready for barbecue season. Luckily, there's a brilliant gardening tool that can help - and you can currently snap it up for £29.99 on the Express Shop. The Bionic Trimmer - as seen on TV - is the ultimate garden trimming tool. It's cordless, weighs just one kilogram and has an ergonomic hand grip, making the toughest of gardening chores much easier. Essentially that means no tangled wires, no extension cords and no petrol smells. Oh, and when it's fully charged it lasts for around 50 minutes so there's heaps of time to fix rough edges or cut weeds away. If you have plenty of beautiful blooms in your backyard, you won't need to worry about accidentally damaging the flowers. The Bionic Trimmer comes with a Flower Guard which easily locks into place (it takes one click) to help you trim without clipping other blooms. It's also useful for protecting the trimmer from rocks, walls and other solid objects. There's also a Debris Shield designed specifically to stop - you guessed it - debris from flicking up while you're using the tool.  When your Bionic Trimmer is set up and ready to go, simply move slowly and steadily through your garden to evenly trim your grass and other plants. It spins at 10,000 RPM to make trimming a breeze, or you can turn it over to use it as an edger.
