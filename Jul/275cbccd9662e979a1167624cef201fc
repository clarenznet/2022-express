Former coach David Roditi yesterday revealed he was once just a computer click away from kicking the ace out of university when the then teenaged Cam came off a moped after a night of partying. Luckily he had a change of heart and Cam used the accident as inspiration to dedicate himself to the sport that will see him face Novak Djokovic on Centre Court later. But David and fellow Texas Christian University coach Devin Bowen were definitely not cheering for Cam after the crash left him needing stitches in his chin. He said: "That was the tip of the iceberg. There was a meeting where Devin and I sat down and wrote an email to his parents. We said, 'We have enjoyed having him here at TCU, he is a great tennis player, but we don't think we are the right fit.' But Devin said he knew that Cam wanted to be a tennis player. "He was just a typical 19 to 20 year-old. At that age you want to have fun, have a couple of beers and chase girls. He needed a secure environment where he could make mistakes." Cam, 26, learned from them. He became Britain's No1 after winning the Indian Wells tournament in October. He broke into the world top 10 for the first time in April. Girlfriend Louise Jacobi has admitted she wasn't interested in the hard-working ace at first as he was always away on tours. But their romance blossomed after she lost her job in October 2019 and he asked her to join him at the Erste Bank Open in Austria. Rafael Nadal last night announced he has withdrawn from Wimbledon because of an injury, handing Nick Kyrgios a walkover into Sunday's men's singles final.
