There will always be that doubt that Rishi Sunak does not understand the issues facing many.Â And his betrayal of the triple lock, refusal to reduce taxes to date and the implementation of higher NI contributions all go against him. If he is elected then the Tories will have once again started to self-destruct. Another major error after ousting Boris will guarantee the loss of the next election. I just do not understand why they cannot see it. I see that Rishi Sunak has spoken about decency and honesty - words I am surprised he has even heard of, says Geoff Manning from Lower Kingswood, Surrey. If the final choice for our new PM ends up between him and Liz Truss, I feel very sorry for the Tory Party. Members will have to choose between a "backstabber" and a woman who seems to be totally lacking in personality.   Is it not strange that millions of Britons jet away to Spain and Greece for two weeks of 100 degree heat, and have a super holiday, yet when we have just two days of sunshine in Britain we are told to stay indoors and not to travel anywhere, otherwise thousands will die? says David Hobson from Birmingham. More hysteria from the green agenda zealots. The West has taken its eyes off the ball in the pursuit of cheap goods and large profits, which has allowed China to slowly infiltrate, gain advantage, widen its influence and undermine us, says David Tyler from Harlow, Essex. The West has also made the mistake of being too dependent on Russian goods. When it annexed the Crimean Peninsula the West did nothing, which gave it the green light to invade Ukraine.   I am afraid Prince Harry looks more and more of a silly figure as time goes on, says Barrie Warren from Bury, Lancashire. Why anybody booked him to lecture the world on climate change, when he lives in a multi-room mansion guzzling power for aircon, drives gas-guzzling limos and flies regularly by private jet, defeats me. It is the same old hypocrisy of: "Do as I say, not as I do."
