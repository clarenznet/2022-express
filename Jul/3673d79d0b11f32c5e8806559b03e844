Almost five million Britons are thought to have symptomatic Covid in the UK right now, the latest data from the ZOE Health Study suggests. The ZOE study has been collecting data on the general population throughout the pandemic. This resurgence in infections - driven by Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 - is providing a trove of data on the evolving profile of symptoms. According to Professor Spector, who heads up the ZOE Health Study, "twice as many covid cases as common colds currently - the ratio has never been so high". Writing on Twitter, he drew attention to the warning signs that can help you tell Covid apart from a common cold.

The most common cold-like symptoms currently reported are: According to the professor, Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 are behind latest the surge in cases. These variants are breaching the immune defences much more effectively than previous variants, he warned. In addition to evading the immune defences, these strains are also "dampening them down" so you don't get that inflammation at first to stop it, Prof Spector explained. It must be noted that this does not render the vaccines ineffective. The current virus may be more tranmissible but it's generally resulting in a milder illness and the COVID-19 vaccines are largely to thank for this mitigating effect.
