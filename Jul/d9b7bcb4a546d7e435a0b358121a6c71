Legendary actress Sharon Stone, 64, decided to forego her bikini top and flaunted her cleavage while throwing her head back in laughter as she enjoyed the summer sun. She captioned the photo: "Gratefully Imperfect on a Perfect Day", while giving 3.2 million followers access to the intimate snap. The Beverly Hills-based blonde soaked up the sunshine in nothing more than a neon green leopard print bikini bottom, while her stripy swimming towel was strategically positioned to protect her ample assets. @lisarinna described her as a "legend", while @angiestevensonofficial praised: "Gorgeous as always!" Despite talk of imperfections, the leggy acting great looked sensational, and quickly accumulated almost 80,000 likes in just a few hours.
