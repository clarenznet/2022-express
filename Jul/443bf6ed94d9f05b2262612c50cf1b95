AROUND 10 fire engines are currently trying to douse a fire that has left six homes burning, fire services have announced. A video shared by a local shows the firemen putting their best foot forward to tackle the massive blaze. At present, several residential properties have been destroyed by the fire and residents are being evacuated from the scene. There are no serious injuries reported at present, but further evacuations are under way, it has been announced. Residents in the local area who are not in the immediate vicinity are urged to keep doors and windows closed while emergency services deal with the incident. Any displaced residents should head to the Calcot Infant School, which is being set up as a triage centre, the fire service stated.  TVP West Berkshire tweeted: “When residents arrive at the triage centre, please advise what property you are from, whether your vehicle remains on Red Cottage Drive, any medication required and any pets left at home address. “Red Cottage Road is currently completely closed at this time.”
