Harmony Tan was left thankful that she wasn't put on Centre Court for her match against British sensation Katie Boulter as there would have been "a lot of people for her". Boulter caused a huge upset on Thursday when she pulled off a stunning comeback win over No 6 seed Karolina Pliskova.  The former world No 1 also reached last year's final, highlighting the level Boulter needed to pull off the result on Centre Court. Boulter later found out her third-round opponent would be Tan, who already pulled off a sensational win over Serena Williams earlier in the tournament. It was strongly expected that match would be put on Centre Court or at least Court One. But Wimbledon surprisingly placed Boulter on the outside courts, with play starting just an hour after the gates were opened. That meant not even half the 4,000-capacity stand was filled by the time the players got to the court. The quiet around the court was a far cry from the loud cheers Boulter would have experienced on Centre Court in her match against Pliskova.  The British crowd have gotten behind their own this week with Heather Watson and Cameron Norrie reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time in their careers. But the few that were in attendance on Court Two were unable to inspire Boulter to victory against Tan. The 25-year-old was not at the races as Tan dominated from start to finish. And the French tennis ace has jokingly thanked Wimbledon officials for not putting her match with Boulter on one of the two big courts.  When asked whether she thought it was better to play Boulter on the No 2 Court at 11am, Tan said: "Yes, of course. Because when you play a Brit on Centre Court, I think there is a lot of people for her," she said. "I like to play on a small court (smiling). I like to play first match also, you know, because I don't wait all the day."
