BBC presenter Clare Balding appeared close to tears as she led tributes to the long-time voice of Wimbledon tennis Sue Barker. Sue Barker is stepping down as the BBC's Wimbledon host after 30 years of presenting at the tournament. Balding's voice threatened to break as she told her co-host: "Honestly from the broadcasting point of view, huge team of people behind the scenes as you know, who are all gonna miss you horribly. "I just genuinely think what you do on camera is so special that mixture of professionalism, but genuine warmth and honesty and it's very special." In response, Barker said: "All I'll say is I'll miss the job. "I which I had the next 30 years to do it, I love it!"  Barker has been an icon of British tennis for generations having reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 1977 before coming the BBC's lead presenter for the tournament. Last month, it was announced that this year's championships would be the last Barker would cover for the BBC. Following this year's final between Novak Djokovic and Australian Nick Kyrgios, Barker was treated to a special montage from her time broadcasting from SW19. Former British number one, Tim Henman was among those who recorded a special farewell message to the BBC presenter.  Tributes also came from Des Lynam, Billie Jean King, Andy Murray, Virginia Wade, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and John McEnroe. "I think it's fair to say we have broken her," Balding remarked as Sue became overcome with emotion. "Listen to this crowd all chanting Sue's name," Balding added. "Billie-Jean has joined us as well because you always say, Billie-Jean, if you can't see it, you can't be it." "She's an amazing example," Billie-Jean said. "If you want to be a presenter and be the best in the field of broadcasting...Sue Barker. "She is the best ever." Barker turned to her co-hosts and said: "Can I just say, it's been an absolute privilege, I've loved it, 30 amazing years, thank you."
