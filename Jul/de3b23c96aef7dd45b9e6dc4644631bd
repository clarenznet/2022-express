Amal Clooney, 44, and her Hollywood star husband, George Clooney, 61, stunned as they made a joint appearance in Lake Como, Italy last night. The couple were photographed holding hands, with Amal looking elegant in a green sequinned dress. The human rights lawyer complemented the spaghetti strap, lace-trimmed number with a clutch bag and wore her long, auburn locks down in the off-duty ensemble. George looked dapper in a short-sleeved navy shirt and light wash jeans, with his hair combed to one side.
