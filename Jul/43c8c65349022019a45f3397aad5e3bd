Cat Deeley, 45, has stunned fans as she showed off a dramatic new look for American reality show, So You Think You Can Dance. The TV star wore waist-length braids as she strutted along a US studio corridor in a tight-fitting red mini-dress in view of her 300,000 Instagram followers.  She was spotted rocking bright gold plaits alongside a collection of bright jewellery.  The Birmingham local wore a tight, figure-hugging dress with bronze shoulder padding.  Cat completed the glamorous look white stilettos and gold chains.  The star has fronted the dance show since 2006 and recently joked to the Daily Mail’s You Magazine about how excited she was about getting back to film its new season after “three years of "three long years of sweat pants, no make up and mum buns.”
