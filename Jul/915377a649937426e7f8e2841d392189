Prices have risen by an average of 19 percent in a year at supermarkets. A standard 170g tin of Kenco Millicano Americano is £8.20 at Ocado, and 165g of L'Or is £7.90, say marketing consultants Assosia. As shoppers feel the pinch, Tesco is putting security tags on some jars to prevent thefts. David Dalton, of All Tag, which provides security tags for food retailers, said he was seeing "more products than ever tagged". He added: "Stores are tagging products they wouldn't normally do - cheese, butter, fresh salmon, even mince."
