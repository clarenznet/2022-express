Alexander Smith claims "dirty tactics" are being used to remove him from Blue House Farm, a property in Newton Bewley, County Durham. The 78-year-old man alleges the water has been turned off and landowner Savills has "chained the gate shut" with no notice - a claim the firm denies. After the previous landowner died, the property was given to the local church. But the church has since sold the farmland to Savills, which says Mr Smith has been asked to leave but says he is currently living there without permission. Speaking to Teesside Live, Mr Smith said: "Two weeks ago a man claiming to be some sort of caretaker said if I left I wouldn't be allowed to return. "Then one Wednesday that same man told the postman not to bring me my meals and then he proceeded to turn off all the water pipes and chain up my gates." A representative from Savills then later approached Mr Smith allegedly asking him to vacate the property or they would be forced to take further action. However, he claims these incidents were the first he'd learnt of his eviction, alleging he has received no written notice, nor a verbal one.  Mr Smith is adamant that he deserves to live on the land in peace and says he has applied for a "right to stop" order after consulting his solicitor. On his feelings about the situation, Mr Smith added: "I'm settled here, it's been my home for 15 years. I don't have any family, this is all I have. "They are using dirty tactics and I just don't think what they are trying to do is right at all." When approached by Teesside Live for comment, a representative of Savills said: "We confirm Mr Smith, who is occupying the site without permission, has been asked to leave. "He does have access to some utility sources and the suggestion that Savills has disconnected Mr Smith’s power and water supply is not accurate."
