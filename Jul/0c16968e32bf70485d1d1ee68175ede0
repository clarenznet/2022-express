We are now less than four weeks away from the start of the new Premier League season, and it is fair to say that there is still plenty of business to be done between now and then. Millions has already been spent by the elite clubs, but do not expect that to stop any time soon as managers desperately look to bolster their squads further. Manchester United have recently jetted out on a pre-season tour of Thailand, but fans are growing more and more frustrated at the fact that the Red Devils have still only completed one major signing so far, with Tyrell Malacia's move from Feyenoord the sole completed arrival. However, there may be light at the end of the tunnel, with United believed to be 'in talks' with Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Leandro Paredes. Meanwhile, over in London, Raheem Sterling is believed to have undergone a medical with Chelsea ahead of an imminent Â£50m transfer from Manchester City. The move is thought to be a popular one with members of the Blues squad, and it will be intriguing to see how the England winger does at Stamford Bridge. There could also be a Premier League outgoing on the horizon, with Leeds' main man Raphinha edging closer to Barcelona. And with the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal still looking keen to splash the cash, there is plenty to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.
