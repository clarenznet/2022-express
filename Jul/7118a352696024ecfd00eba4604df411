 Amanda Holden, 51, has taken to Instagram with pictures of her showing off her glistening legs. The presenter could be seen wearing a flowery summer dress and she posed for shots.  In further snaps, she could be seen playfully catwalking in the Heart FM offices as she grinned and strolled slowly with her hand on her hips.  Amanda was wearing a white summer dress with bright yellow sun patterns.  The star wore brown heels to finish the look along with her hair in a ponytail.  She leaned back in a chic pose as she smiled for the camera.
