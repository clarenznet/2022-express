A Balmoral insider told The Sun on Sunday: “Staff have been told to expect the full list of royals including Harry, Meghan and their children Archie and Lilibet. "They are preparing for the Sussexes.” Another insider told the Sun: “Balmoral is the perfect place for them to spend a little bit of quality time with the Queen.
