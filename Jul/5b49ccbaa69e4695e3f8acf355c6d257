Eva Longoria put on a stunning display as she opted to sunbathe topless in Marbella, Spain. The Desperate Housewives actress, 47, and her husband, José Bastón, touched down in the Mediterranean island and Eva wasted no time in getting to the beach to top up her already perfect tan. In view of her 8.8 million Instagram followers, the mother-of-one put her incredibly toned figure on display as she soaked up the Spanish sun which she shared in a black and white snap. In her next story, Eva slurped on an exotic-looking drink as she captured a selfie on her phone. The star's peachy rear could be seen at the edge of the snap while she decided to forgo a bikini top once again.
