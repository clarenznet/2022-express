The letter told them that their language was "disgusting" and that they should remember that they were now living in one of the best places to live in Hull - not in their old area. The note from the neighbour read: "I couldn't help but hear the disgusting language that came from your household over the weekend. Polite reminder you are now on Kingswood, one of the best places to live! Not Preston Road!" Posting a picture online, the neighbour wrote: "Come home to this letter posted anonymously with a stamp, what a lovely community. Anyone want to own up?" The letter has had residents up-in-arms, HullLive reports. As one resident wrote: "What an absolute snob" - a sentiment echoed by other users. Someone else said: "What's wrong with Preston Road? I lived there when I was younger (snobs). "Some sad sad folk, it's Kingswood, not Buckingham Palace," added another. "And FYI nothing wrong with Preston Road, maybe if they grew up in a community like that they wouldn't be posting anonymous letters. SAD." Another resident was in agreement and said: "Never knew Kingswood was as posh as Buckingham Palace. Whoever wrote the letter needs to get a grip." Meanwhile, some users seemed to side with the anonymous sender. One person said: "Maybe be mindful about your language, not everyone appreciates hearing it." Another said: "Don't agree with an anonymous letter at all... however, if it was my neighbours I would just politely ask them to watch their language (if loud and outside" as I have a young child that I wouldn't want hearing it."
