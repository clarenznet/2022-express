The Coco Pops and All-Bran maker brought legal action against Government laws coming into force in October. They restrict where some foods can be displayed in supermarkets or online and ban multi-buy promotions of those deemed high in fat, sugar or salt.  In April, Kellogg's claimed the curbs were unlawful because cereals' nutritional value will be assessed by their dry weight as sold, rather than how they are eaten...usually with milk. But yesterday, Mr Justice Linden said the "as sold versus as consumed" issue had "long since been resolved, was well understood and was accepted in the sector". He said there was "no dispute" breakfast cereals can be part of a healthy diet, "but...if it contains excess fat, sugar or salt, that feature of the product is adverse to a child's health". The judge added Kellogg's UK division had estimated it would lose Â£5million in annual profits due to location promotion curbs. Kellogg's UK's managing director Chris Silcock said the firm was "disappointed" with the ruling, but did not intend to appeal.
