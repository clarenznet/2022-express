Victoria Beckham, 48, sent fans “kisses from Positano” as she shared a picture of her and husband David’s lavish holiday on the Italian coast. In the snap, shared in view of Posh Spice’s 30.2 million followers, David could be seen posing up a storm in a tiny pair of swimming trunks. David was also shirtless as he soaked up the sun on a yacht, with the former footballer adding some stylish shades to his summery look. Victoria teased fans as she captioned the post: “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!!! Kisses from Positano.”
