The release of a matriarch, bull and two youngsters is led by Kent Wildlife Trust and the Wildwood Trust. It is part of a Â£1.12million biodiversity project at West Blean and Thornden Woods, near Canterbury, Kent, funded by the People's Postcode Lottery. The bison will live in a fenced enclosure to help restore the woods with their natural behaviour - grazing, felling trees, eating bark and taking dust baths - which will open the canopy and create new spaces for other wildlife. The bison will soon be joined by species like Exmoor ponies, Iron Age pigs and Longhorn cattle.  Ranger Donovan Wright, who will look after the bison, along with colleague Tom Gibbs, says he can't wait for the first calf to be born.
