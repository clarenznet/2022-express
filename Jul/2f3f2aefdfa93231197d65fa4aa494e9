Most of the MPs who have stabbed Boris in the back can say goodbye to their jobs at the next election as many of the voters liked Boris and will not forgive their treachery. Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems will form a coalition government, only because of the refusal of voters to cast their vote in protest as many were prepared to accept Boris's flaws as they admired his determination to get things done. Horrors will be inflicted on us by the EU-loving woke regime within months.  There was clearly a vendetta against Boris, a man who supports the people and listens to us, says Wendy Payne from Winscombe, North Somerset. He got on with the job. Who else did? Not the opposition, who only had one agenda and that was to get Boris out. Nobody knows what loyalty is these days, especially those who Boris stuck by. I am ashamed to be called British. This is Maggie Thatcher all over again.  Since coming into power Boris has faced some of the biggest crises this country, or the world, has ever seen, says Dick Waring from Fareham, Hampshire. He said he would lead us out of Europe and did it in a way that even the EU had to admire. He led the world in pushing for a Covid vaccine, and was at the forefront of supporting Ukraine. He is one of the best PMs we have ever had. His MPs should be ashamed. I do not trust Rishi Sunak or Sajid Javid to do better than Boris and I sure as hell do not trust Keir Starmer, says Nigel Clemow from Newquay, Cornwall. But I have faith in Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, so I know where my vote will go if she stands.  Claims that there is a stealth plan among civil servants to frustrate Brexit is utter nonsense, says Richard Jones from Winchester, Hampshire. UK civil servants work to deliver the objectives of the elected government with integrity, impartiality, objectivity and with honesty. The childish "Sir Humphrey" line is as outdated as it is wrong and seeks to undermine trust, sow division and generate hatred when what is needed is unity.
