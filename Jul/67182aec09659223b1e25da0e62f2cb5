Kimberley Garner, 31, put on an eye-popping display as she attended the UK gala screening of Bullet Train. The TV personality stunned as she donned a red cut-out dress at the event, which was held at Cineworld Leicester Square in London. Kimberley posed up a storm on the red carpet in the show-stopping floor-length gown, which featured an extreme low-cut neckline and cut-out details around the sides of her slender frame. She paired the look with a subtle smokey eye and blush lips as she let her long, blonde hair down, framing her face.
