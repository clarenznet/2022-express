Standing inside an elevator, the Loose Women star, 62, took a Boomerang selfie revealing she'd suffered a wardrobe blunder before going on air. While holding a suitcase and large handbag, Ruth penned in view of her one million followers: "What you can't see is that I've spilt coffee all down my white t-shirt! "Oops!" she added as a sticker while using another to cover the offending stain. Ahead of revealing her stained top, Ruth had taken to her stories to let her followers know that she was appearing on shopping channel, QVC. Filming her journey from a car, Ruth soaked up the sun as she prepared for three hours in front of the camera.
