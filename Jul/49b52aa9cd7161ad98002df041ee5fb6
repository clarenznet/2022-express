Christine McGuinness has taken to Instagram to share defiant clips of her incredible bikini body, days after sheÂ posted a cryptic quote on Instagram after insisting that there were no problems in her relationship with her husband of 11 years, Paddy McGuinness. The mum-of-three, 34, looked phenomenal in a white, bandeau style bikini which she paired with a kaftan of the same colour. She posed playfully in front of a mirror in her home showcasing her incredible figure in the tiny two-piece. Christine wore her highlighted blonde tresses in a high ponytail away from her face as she stepped out into her garden to enjoy the British heatwave. Once outside, the wife of TV star Paddy flaunted her assests as she gave her 660,000 followers a generous birds-eye view while revealing her immaculately kept garden. In a previous story, Christine wrote: "Stunning day, probably going to get five minutes out her before someone shouts "Muummmmmmyyyy." (sic)
