Day Seven at Wimbledon saw mixed results for British hopefuls as Heather Watson crashed out while Cameron Norrie surged into the next round. It proved to be a bridge too far for superstar Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, as he was defeated by Jannik Sinner. Norrie will play in the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time in his career after he won in straight sets against American Tommy Paul. Norrie was in control from start to finish as he secured a 6-4 7-5 6-4 win to book his place in the last eight. Sinner, meanwhile, defeated Alcaraz in a thrilling 6-1 6-4 6-7 (8-10) 6-3 win, while another young star in Frances Tiafoe was also sent home. The American was unceremoniously dumped out of Wimbledon after a thrilling contest against David Goffin, who emerged victorious after the 7-6 (7-3) 5-7 5-7 6-4 7-5 clash. Elsewhere, World No.1 Novak Djokovic was forced to work for his four-set win over Tim van Rijthoven on Centre Court. The Serbian appeared to be faltering against the big-serve 25-year-old but he found his groove and blew his opponent away in style as he looks to retain his title.
