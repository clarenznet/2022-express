The transfer window is hotting up, and we're fast reaching the stage where the Premier League giants have to part with some of their top assets.

Manager Julian Naglesmann has refused to rule out a move, and his cryptic comments are likely to go down very poorly in north London. Meanwhile, just across the capital, unrest is rife at Chelsea and their appears to be real divisions emerging between manager Thomas Tuchel and his compatriot Timo Werner.
