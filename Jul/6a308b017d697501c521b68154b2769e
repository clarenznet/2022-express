According to the reports, the offer to reside at Balmoral could see the US-based Sussexes stay with Her Majesty briefly while other senior royals are not about. The 96-year-old monarch arrived in the Highlands on Thursday and is set to stay for ten weeks at seven-bed Craigowan Lodge.  A Balmoral insider told The Sun: “Staff have been told to expect the full list of royals including Harry, Meghan and their children Archie and Lilibet. "They are preparing for the Sussexes.” Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, quit the UK in spring 2020 and have not been to the Highlands to see the Queen since 2018. They visited Britain for June’s Platinum Jubilee but did not stay long and were kept in the background for the Buckingham Palace balcony appearance.  Another insider said: “Balmoral is the perfect place for them to spend a little bit of quality time with the Queen. "They barely had 15 minutes with her at the jubilee.” But another source told The Sun on Sunday: “I would be stunned if they did turn up.” A ring of steel has been set up around Craigowan Lodge while a new £20,000 wheelchair-friendly lift will help the Queen with her mobility problems.
