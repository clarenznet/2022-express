Leon Gleed, 29, has called on the supermarket to change the packaging of their flushable swabs after wrongly using them for days. The lorry driver developed a soreness around his bottom which he described as a "burning pain". He said he has had to use Sudocrem to soothe his nasty rash since. "The only way I can describe it is like the night after a hot curry but ten times worse," Leon added. "Being a lorry driver it was hard to get in and out of the truck for a while because of the constant chafing and burning pain. "I know it was a silly mistake to make but I'm convinced there's other people out there who have done the same." Leon's girlfriend Sadie Williams bought the product from a Tesco Express in Risca, south Wales, placed them near the toilet so they were in a handy location to clean the loo. But Leon made the error repeatedly and, when he confessed all to Sadie, she burst out laughing. The HGV driver continued: "I thought the product was wet wipes you use to go to the toilet with - but as it turned out, that wasn't the case. "When I developed the soreness I knew something wasn't quite right and when I checked the packaging it said 'kills 99 per cent of bacteria'. "Sadie said to me 'how can you be so stupid', but I think cleaning products should have warning labels on them so they're more identifiable. "I've come through the worst of it now - I had to use Sudocrem down there for a week."  A spokesperson for Tesco, said: "We were sorry to hear about this. "We make the labelling on our packaging as clear as possible for customers. "Our toilet roll and related products are also in a separate aisle in the Risca Extra from these cleaning wipes."
