Holly stunned in the baby pink midi number which showcased her incredible figure. The This Morning star, 41, donned the glamorous number for the TRIC Awards which was being held at The Grosvenor House Hotel in London last night. Holly cut a chic figure in the tight-fitting dress as she posed up a storm for snaps. The mother-of-three wore her blonde tresses in their usual wavy style alongside a full face of glamorous makeup. Also in attendance was her This Morning co-host Philip Schofield, as well as the show's guest presenter Rochelle Humes who appeared with her husband, Marvin.
