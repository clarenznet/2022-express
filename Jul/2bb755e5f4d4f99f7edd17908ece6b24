Moores, whose family founded the Littlewoods retail empire, was a lifelong Reds fan. He served as chairman for 16 years from 1991. His wife Marge died recently after 39 years of marriage. Ex-player and manager Sir Kenny Dalglish said online he and his wife Lady Marina "are both very saddened by the passing of David Moores. "He was a loyal Liverpool fan whose dream came true when he was appointed chairman, and he did a tremendous amount to help the club. "Our condolences go to his family. He'll be greatly missed by all who knew him. RIP". Former Liverpool striker and TV pundit Michael Owen posted: "Heartbreaking. RIP Chairman. All the lads thought the world of you." A club statement read: "The thoughts of everyone at Liverpool FC are with David's family and friends." The Moores family held a majority stake in the Anfield football club for more than half a century. After taking over, David and chief executive Rick Parry oversaw the managerial appointments of Roy Evans, Gerard Houllier and Rafael Benitez, winning 10 major honours including the Champions League in 2005. Moores sold his controlling interest to Tom Hicks and George Gillett two years later but the Americans were forced out in a boardroom battle. The club was sold to New England Sports Ventures, now Fenway Sports Group.
