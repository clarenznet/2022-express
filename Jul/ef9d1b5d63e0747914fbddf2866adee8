Wimbledon may be over for another year, but there is still plenty going on in the world of tennis as all eyes turn towards next month's US Open. Novak Djokovic claimed his seventh title at SW19 on Sunday with an impressive victory over Nick Kyrgios in the men's singles final, but his participation in New York is still uncertain. Foreign visitors are still required to have been vaccinated in order to enter the States, and it remains to be seen if an exception will be made for Djokovic, who is now just one Slam behind his long-time rival Rafael Nadal as the battle to become tennis' all-time GOAT continues. Meanwhile, closer to home, Andy Murray has been back in action for the first time since his disappointing second round Wimbledon defeat to John Isner. The Scot is participating at the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island, where he has beaten Max Purcell and Sam Querrey to make it to the quarter-finals, and he will play Alexander Bublik on Friday. And to be the first to find out the latest news about the likes of Roger Federer, Nadal and Emma Raducanu amongst others, keep your eyes peeled right here.
