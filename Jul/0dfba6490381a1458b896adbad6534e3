The 18-month-old Shar Pei had been signed over to the RSPCA after being found in unsuitable conditions. Reggie arrived at the Sussex, Brighton and East Grinstead branch of the charity with infected eyes and sore skin.  Surgeons removed excess skin covering his face and two weeks later Reggie has recovered so well he is off his medication and ready to re-homed. Lauren Pearce, RSPCA deputy head of dogs, said: "Reggie is such a sweetheart, so so friendly and loves everyone.  "Reggie's breed is prone having problems due to their extra skin but with the treatment he's had, we hope that this will help prevent further skin problems. We hope the right person comes forward so he can get stuck into enjoying his new life." "The surgery cost almost Â£2,000 - a special rate givena local clinic - which was funded by the branch.
