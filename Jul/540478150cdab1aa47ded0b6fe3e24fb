Brendan Fraser, 53, looks utterly transformed in press photos for his new film, The Whale. He plays a 600lb reclusive man in the Darren Aronofsky picture, which also stars Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink. Sadie, who plays Max Mayfield in the hit Netflix series, will star as Brendan’s on-screen daughter. Brendan plays an obese man who struggles to reconnect with his 17-year-old daughter, in his first leading role in more than ten years. Speaking about the role to Unilad last year, Brendan said: “It’s gonna be like something you haven’t seen before. “That’s really all I can tell you.” He has recently experienced a surge in popularity which has been dubbed ‘the Brenaissance’, as The Mummy star returned to the spotlight after suffering from numerous health issues and claiming he had been “touched inappropriately” in 2003. After struggling with his mental health and injuries on the set of his films, Brendan was moved to tears recently when he admitted he was “feeling the love” from his dedicated legion of fans.
