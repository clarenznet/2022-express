Week two of Wimbledon 2022 rolls on with Nick Kyrgios, Rafael Nadal and Simona Halep among those in action on Wednesday. Kyrgios has been one of the headline attractions at SW19 this year, but his run to the quarter-finals has been shrowded by his on-court behaviour and looming reports off it. On Tuesday, Novak Djokovic fought back from two sets down to defeat 20-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner on Centre Court. Later on, Cameron Norrie was also triumphant in a five-set epic, setting up a semi-final showdown with the six-time Wimbledon champion. Kyrgios faces Chilean Cristian Garin on Court 1 to join them in the final four, while Rafael Nadal continues his quest for the Calendar Grand Slam on Centre Court against American 11th-seed Taylor Fritz.
