After last night’s mega EuroMillions jackpot, the National Lottery is offering yet another prize to Lotto players this evening. Tonight’s Lotto draw could make one ticket holder £5.3 million richer - and as the saying goes, it could be you. Lotto is the most popular National Lottery draw in the UK, with around 15 to 45 million tickets sold twice a week. But even though so many tickets have been bought, no winners have been found in the last three draws. Wednesday’s draw is a rollover, meaning the jackpot is boosted, and one lucky player could take home £5.3 million tonight. If no ticket holder matches the numbers drawn, the jackpot is rolled over to create a bigger jackpot next week. There can be up to four rollovers, but if no one wins the main jackpot in any of those games, the next Lotto game will become a “Must Be Won” draw. The Lotto can only roll over five times - ending in a Must Be Won draw. Playing is just as easy - you can purchase your ticket online or in newsagents, then all you have to do is pick six numbers from one to 59 and a bonus ball. So, with Lotto being only £2 a go, what’s stopping you from taking your chances at becoming a millionaire?  Tonight's Lotto numbers are: 9, 25, 36, 41, 44, 54 and the bonus ball is 48. The Thunderball numbers are: 1, 3, 18, 36, 37 and the Thunderball is 1 If you don’t bag the jackpot, there are still plenty of other prizes available if you match the right numbers.
