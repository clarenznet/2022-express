Keith Claringbull, 72, crashed into Christina Yates's Fiat 500, propelling it into an articulated lorry. She died from catastrophic injuries 16 days later. But Mrs Yates's two sons told a judge the accident was "unintentional and unfortunate". They added: "We don't feel it's right he's jailed." Father-of-two Claringbull has now been given a two-year community order, a three-year driving ban and a Â£280 court bill. The accident happened on the A52 at Kingsley, near Stoke-on-Trent, as Claringbull turned out of Kingsley Works Quarry last October. Claringbull, from Hanley, Stoke, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at North Staffordshire Justice Centre. In a victim impact statement, one of Mrs Yates's sons told the court how he visited his mother in Royal Stoke University Hospital every day after the accident. The statement said: "It started to become clear that she was getting less likely to wake up. She had a list of catastrophic injuries. Treatment was stopped and life support was removed.
