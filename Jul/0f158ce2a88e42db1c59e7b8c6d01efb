Tottenham players were involved in a feisty half-time exchange with their Sevilla counterparts after a challenge by Son Heung-min appeared to leave Gonzalo Montiel with a bloodied mouth. A goalless first half in South Korea was not without action as Antonio Conte's side continued their preparations for the 2022-23 Premier League season. Son appeared to catch Montiel with his elbow, only to accidentally leave the player worse for wear. The South Korean forward, who was given a hero's welcome back in his home country, was confronted by opposition players and the incident turned into an exchange between several individuals from either side. Football.London reported: "Half time here between Spurs and Sevilla and there's a little scuffle as the whistle goes with various players weighing in. Not too much of a friendly, this one." Conte named a strong side for the friendly, which included Son in attack alongside Harry Kane and summer purchase Richarlison. But the trio failed to score in the first half. This was the second of Spurs' pre-season friendlies during their tour of South Korea. The North Londoners thumped a K League XI 6-3 in midweek, with Son scoring twice. Conte's side face Rangers in their next clash as they continue to prepare for the new campaign, before they meet former boss Jose Mourinho's Roma. They then begin the Premier League season against Southampton on August 6.
