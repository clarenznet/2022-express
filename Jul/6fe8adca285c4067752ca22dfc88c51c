Die Hard star Bruce Willis, 67, has been diagnosed with the condition aphasia, which causes issues with communication, but he was having no trouble conveying how much he loves ten-year-old Mabel when they embarked on a sweet dance-off this week. The footage of the pair enjoying some father-daughter bonding time was captured by his wife Emma Heming Willis, 44, and uploaded to Instagram. Mabel is retired actor Bruce's fifth child, as he has two with Emma and three with ex-wife and fellow showbiz star Demi Moore. Mabel, who could scarcely keep the smiles off her face, danced barefoot while clad in a NASA t-shirt and turquoise blue shorts. Meanwhile, a relaxed-looking Bruce opted for a blue shirt with a ship logo, a pair of shorts and black trainers. As the pair practised their moves together, the look of love on his face for his blossoming daughter was clearly apparent.
