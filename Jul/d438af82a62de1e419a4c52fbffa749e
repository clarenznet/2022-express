Helicopter pictures show the changes made along the river, with new public spaces developed as part of the main construction work. Tunnelling is now complete in the nine-year scheme to build the giant sewer, designed to clean up the Thames which still uses the crumbling Victorian sewage system.  And work is now about to start on the above-ground public spaces created by the tunnel. Clare Donnelly, lead architect on the project, said: "Creating new public spaces in London is an incredible opportunity and it's so exciting after all these years to see these spaces coming to life.  New public spaces in Wapping, Blackfriars, Victoria, Vauxhall, Chelsea and Putney will benefit Londoners and visitors to the city for generations to come, and we can't wait for them to open." The project is due to be completed by 2025.
