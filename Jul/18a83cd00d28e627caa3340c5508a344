Phil Mickelson is one of the many big names competing at The Open at St Andrews this week. The tournament comes at a time when the sport is bitterly divided thanks to the emergence of the LIV tour, bankrolled by the Saudi public investment fund. Mickelson and other household names ditched the PGA Tour, and could now face bans from all four majors next year, according to reports. The American was reportedly paid $200million (£159million) just for turning up to the new tour. Golf has been kind to Mickelson, who has amassed a fortune of around £340million, Forbes estimated in 2020. He has won around £80million on the PGA Tour throughout his career, with 45 victories including six majors, 37 runners-up finishes and 197 top-10s. This has enabled him to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, as evidenced by his array of supercars and humongous mansions. He is currently building a home on Florida's tax haven Jupiter Island, it has been reported. Mickelson previously lived in a £1.5million home in San Diego from 1999 until he and his family sold the property in 2012. He then moved to a £4.5million 9,100 square-foot home in Rancho Santa Fe before putting it up for sale in 2014. Houses are not the only thing Mickelson has splurged on – he also has a love of sports cars. Mickelson has been seen driving a Bentley Continental GT – worth £160,000. He has also owned an Aston Martin Vanquish, which has a top speed of over 200mph and came with a £200,000 price tag. The American also customised his 48-volt EV EZGO golf cart, costing him over £10,000.

He also has expensive taste when it comes to drink. An avid wine collector, Mickelson once poured a bottle of 1990 Romanee Conti into the Claret Jug he won at The Open in 2013. Speaking to The Scotsman about it, he said: "I’ve loved having the Jug with me for the last 12 months. "The people who know and love the game get a big kick out of it. They really appreciate what it means to hold such a famous trophy. And drink out of it." When quizzed about what he drank from it, he replied: "I only let them drink the good stuff of course.
