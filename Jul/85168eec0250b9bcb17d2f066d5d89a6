Donna D’Errico, 54, of Baywatch fame took to Instagram in a sassy photo post in which she slammed haters who said she was “too old” for bikini pictures. The star said she felt no shame in posting sexy swimwear shots.  It was a reaction to the abuse she received on the 4th of July after sharing a video of herself in a bathing suit.  The actress was seen crouching on top of a coffee table as she was dressed in a pink swimwear set.  She said: “Quite a few women complained about the 4th of July video I posted in a red white & blue bikini because they thought I was ‘classier than that’ and ‘too old to wear a bikini’ and, my favorite, ‘desperate,’” shared the bombshell.  “Let me tell you something that might surprise you.  “I can actually wear and do literally whatever I want. On that note, here is me in a bikini squatting on a coffee table.”
