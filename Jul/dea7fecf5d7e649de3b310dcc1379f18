The 40-year-old oozed summer chic in the outfit which she accessorised with a matching bag and shoes. Pussycat Dolls singer Ashley went braless for the occasion but covered up in dark sunglasses. She beamed at waiting photographers after the Heart Breakfast show, which she hosts alongside Amanda Holden. Earlier this year Ashley opened up about embracing her sexy side and vowed not to tone things down. Speaking to The Sun, she said: "As you get older you start giving less f***s. You are more connected to yourself and wiser. “I feel excited about the years to come because I feel better than how I felt in my twenties. Part of how I express my femininity is feeling sexy. “It makes me sad to think about women not allowing themselves to feel that as we continue on," she added.
