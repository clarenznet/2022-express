Bjorn Ulvaeus, 77, is the talk of the town as he continued to take part in ABBA's comeback tour. The legendary performer made his red carpet debut with his new partner Christina Sas, 49, who is 28 years his junior, on Tuesday. She supported the musician on the red carpet for the premiere of his new film, Pippi At The Circus in Stockholm, Sweden. According to The Sun, the pair met during the release of Abba Voyage in Germany, with Christina working for Abba’s label Universal there. This comes just five months after the singer announced he had split from his wife of 41 years, Lena Kallersjo. The joint statement read: "After many fine and eventful years, we have decided to divorce. "We remain close and good friends and will continue to celebrate our grandchildren’s birthdays and other family celebrations together."
