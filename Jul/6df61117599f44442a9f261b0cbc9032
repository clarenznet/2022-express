A crime scene remains in place as the investigation, led by the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, continues. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Wood, said: “Firstly my thoughts are with the young man’s friends and family at this incredibly difficult time. I want to reassure them and the wider community that we are working around the clock to establish exactly what happened. “It is possible that the events surrounding this incident were captured on doorbell or dashcam footage. I would urge anyone in Beckenham Hill Road and the surrounding streets to check their devices for any footage. We are especially keen to trace anyone else that was in the park at the time. "Please take a look and call us if you have recordings of any vehicles or people acting suspiciously in the area. It is vital that we establish what happened to this young man.” No arrests have been made and enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.
