Nick Gardner, of Gairloch, in the Highlands, was “knocked for six” when partner Janet was moved to a care home with Alzheimer’s and osteoporosis. It prompted the grandad of four to launch his Munros bid in July 2020, aged 80. Two years later, the former teacher has only eight left to “bag”. He said: “When Janet went into care it absolutely shattered me." "She was the most wonderful and caring wife, mother and grandmother possible, and now she doesn’t recognise me." “I was heading into some mental condition, so I thought I have to get myself a challenge, to pull me out.” Nick gave himself 1,200 days to climb all the Munros – Scottish mountains over 3,000ft – and is close to raising £50,000 for Alzheimer Scotland and the Royal Osteoporosis Society. He plans to tackle his final summit – 4,084ft Cairn Gorm – in a fortnight, joined by friends and family. It means he is on track to finish in under 800 days. Nick said: “I’ll probably cry when I make it to the end.”
