The Queen's stunning grandchild Zara Tindall wowed at the wedding of Stephanie Phillips and William Hosier on July 9, 2022. Zara stole the show in a head-turning mini dress. She opted for a Zimmermann number - the Super Eight Embroidered Mini Dress in Cornflower Blue. The material is Broderie Anglaise. This is the first time Zara stepped out in this particular number, giving royal fans a treat.

It included tiny cut outs under the shoulder blades and around the waist. This accentuated the royal's slim figure. The dress boasted a high, regal collar with a touch of embroidery. It was fastened by a long line of buttons which began at the collar and ended at the bottom of the skirt. Undoubtedly the most exciting feature of the dress was its length, as it showed off the perfect pins of the equestrian royal. Zimmermann is a firm favourite among women in the Royal Family. Kate Middleton first debuted a white embroidered gown by the Australian fashion designer in 2014 during the royal tour of Australia and New Zealand.
