The deputy Prime Minister of Ireland accused Downing Street of being “undemocratic and very disrespectful” towards the people of Northern Ireland. Speaking on BBC, Mr Varadkar said: “I think that’s a strategic mistake for people who want to maintain the union because if you continue to impose things on Northern Ireland that a clear majority of people don’t want, that means more people will turn away from the union.” He added that he found it “shocking and hard to accept” that Downing Street sought unilaterally to change the protocol and noted: “What the British government is doing now is very undemocratic and very disrespectful to people in Northern Ireland because it’s taking that power away from the assembly.”
