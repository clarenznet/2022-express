Since 2019, we have made great progress and we are starting to see rewards. But we now need to go further and faster, making sure people feel safer. We have more than 13,000 new police officers on the streets and we have given them more powers, including dealing with chaotic and disruptive protests. We have also increased custodial sentences so that those who commit the most heinous crimes are locked up for longer. This includes killer drivers, child murderers and those who kill police officers. As we continue to recruit 20,000 police officers, now is the time to make sure more officers are actually on the beat dealing with crime. We know that just 15 minutes of police patrols on our streets can reduce violent crime by 70 per cent. And our uplift in officers gives the opportunity to make this a reality. It’s also now time for the police to get back to basics and spend their time investigating real crimes – murder, burglary and serious violence, not Twitter rows and hurt feelings. We will hold the police, and their senior leadership, to account on the progress they are making. We will publish league tables. If they are doing poorly, they will need to explain, both to the Home Secretary and to you, how they will turn things around. Burglary is one of the most intrusive crimes a family can face. The knowledge that someone has been in your house can cause serious upheaval and long-term trauma. That is why I will ensure the police send an officer to every domestic burglary, so people know such an intrusive crime is being taken seriously and no stone will be left unturned in bringing them to justice. When our streets are safer, our communities are more prosperous. When our communities are more prosperous, our nation is great. No ifs, no buts, police must solve more crimes.
