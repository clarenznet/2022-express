Gordon Ramsay is notorious for his savage TV antics, infamously raging at one Hell's Kitchen customer that he would ram a pumpkin "right up your f*****g a**e". His co-star, First Dates host Fred Sirieix, has now exclaimed that, though it might be difficult to believe, Gordon is exactly the same off screen as he is on TV, and picks fights with him all the time. Fred Sirieix, 52, has appeared on the Road Trip series with both Gordon and Italian chef Gino D'Acampo, and claims that he is the "easygoing" personality out of the trio. Asked if Gordon can be volatile, he declared: "What you see is what you get. "Just like what you see on the TV. Exactly like that." "Maybe it's difficult for you to believe but that's the truth. It's exactly like that!" READ NOW:Â Ainsley Harriott threatens legal action after sister nearly drowned Fred has also told us that Gordon picks fights over "the most trivial things". "All the time!" he exclaimed. "About a burger that's too salty or not salty enough, about onions that are not chopped finely enough, stupid s**t like that." "He says it to everybody [including] me and Gino."  He once produced an Instagram outtake of a horrified Gordon trying not to look after he stripped naked during an outdoor barbeque and pranced around, testing out his dance moves. "We have good friendships, we have a lot of fun," he confided. "I'm easy going, and happy to experience people, cultures, experiences, and just go for the ride. "I think it's a great source of enjoyment, never-ending in fact." Meanwhile First Dates host Fred shared with us his own concept for an ideal first date for a foodie minded romance seeker. "I would go to Paris because it's the sexiest city in the world," he declared. "I'd go and stroll on the Seine, maybe go and dance the tango on the steps of the Opera House." Fred is currently starring on Celebrity Gogglebox with the fiancee who he has nicknamed "Fruitcake".
