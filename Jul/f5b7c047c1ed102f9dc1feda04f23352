A special royal edition of Country Life will be released on Wednesday, July 13, guest edited by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. This will mark the royal's 75th birthday as well as the magazine’s 125th anniversary. Camilla looks exquisite on the cover of Country Life. But not just any photo of the royal, this picture was taken by the Duchess of Cambridge herself. Kate photographed the Duchess of Cornwall at her Wiltshire retreat in the gardens of Raymill. She is pictured sitting down on a bench holding a basket of beautiful pelargoniums.

In keeping with the garden theme of the magazine, the dress was decorated with little white flowers. The white flowers also boasted flecks of pink which added a further pop of colour to the dress. The dress also boasted a loose collar and was fastened by several small buttons along the middle. Camilla paired the floral print dress with a soft baby blue cardigan. The royal sat with her sleeves rolled up as if she was about to get stuck in to the gardening. We know that the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall are avid gardeners and even get quite competitive over their fruits and vegetables. Camilla is the third guest-editor of Country Life, with her husband receiving the honour twice before, the first in November 2013 to mark his 65th birthday and the second in 2018 to mark his 70th.

But with Camilla looking especially summery and elegant on this month's cover, the July 2022 issue is sure to be a great success. Princess Anne masterminded the July 29, 2020 issue to commemorate her 70th birthday. Camilla looked just radiant on the most recent cover, with the blue dress and cardigan bringing out her eyes.
