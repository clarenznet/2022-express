England fans can win a £3,000 holiday voucher by visiting their local Greene King pub tonight. The Lionesses’ can book their place in the UEFA Women’s European Championship by beating Sweden at Bramall Lane. And supporters can win a £3,000 holiday voucher by scanning a unique code on the Greene King Season Ticket app. Individuals who do so will be automatically entered into the competition. A press release said: “Pub company and brewer Greene King has launched a limited time prize draw in support of the England Women’s squad. “For the duration of tonight’s semi final, any customer in a Greene King sports pub who scans the unique 10 per-cent off drinks code on the Season Ticket app will be automatically entered into the competition. “The season ticket app, which gives users access to a range of unique offers and discounts, is available to download via the Apple store here or the Google store here. “Tonight’s grand prize is a £3,000 holiday voucher, valid on a number of major providers including Jet2, TUI and more. “The competition was created to raise awareness and generate support for the team, following the news that 43% of women said they couldn’t name a single female footballer. Men weren’t much better, with only 31 per-cent of people able to name at least one player.” JUST IN: Chelsea may already have Jules Kounde transfer alternative Chris Conchie, head of marketing for Greene King Sport, said: “Even though the Lionesses are breaking records left right and centre, there’s still a massive lack of awareness for the individual players in the squad. Our fleet of branded vehicles are the latest in our ongoing drive to champion the efforts of the team and support them as they continue to succeed throughout the tournament.” To further raise awareness of the women’s team, Greene King has collaborated with former footballer Rachel Yankey, unveiling a fleet of delivery vehicles branded with the names of several current Lionesses. Former England attacker Rachel Yankey added: “The current squad has already broken some incredible records over the last few games, and I have no doubt that they’re going to continue to do so. It’s so encouraging to see the support building as we progress to the final stages of the tournament. The Women’s Euro tournament is being shown in over 900 Greene King sports sites across the UK. The participating sites are listed below.
