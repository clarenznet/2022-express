Russian tennis star Karen Khachanov has had his hotel room robbed while competing at the Hamburg Open this week, according to reports in his native country. Khachanov is playing on the ATP Tour for the first time in a month after Russian's were banned from competing at Wimbledon.  He's back in action in Germany as his preparations for the US Open get underway. And the world No 26 got off to a winning start against Jan-Lennard Struff, beating the German in three sets. But ahead of his match against Fabio Fognini, news broke in Russia that Khachanov had his hotel room robbed. “Karen is playing at a tournament in Hamburg this week, his game has improved, he feels great, but on Thursday an extremely unpleasant event happened," A source told Russian outlet RIA Novosti. "Karen’s room was robbed, they even pulled everything out of the safe." It is said that the "special services" are now working to try and find the thieves. The report indicates that Khachanov wasn't present when his hotel room was robbed. Khachanov was one of several top ATP and WTA stars banned from competing in this year's Wimbledon Championships. The 26-year-old was left "devastated" by the All England Club's decision.  “About Wimbledon, obviously, I’m just really sad – really sad, disappointed, devastated that these things are happening right now for everybody, you know, and that we came to this point," he said back in April. “For me, it’s one of the nicest tournaments in the world. "You know, it’s special. I had a good run there last year – I played the quarterfinals. And, you know, I’m just really sad that I will be not able to compete there and give my best in one of the biggest tournaments during the year that we have, these four grand slams. "So yeah, like I mentioned, I’m really sad that the decision was taken.”
