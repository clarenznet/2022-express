Escape to the Chateau stars Angel, 44, and Dick Strawbridge, 62, have marked their children’s first snorkelling lesson in a new Instagram post. The couple took to their TV series’ official account, where they boast 415,000 followers, to share a snap with their two children, Arthur, nine, and Dorothy, eight. The happy family smiled for the camera as they enjoyed their fun-filled annual summer holidays by the sea. They revealed in the post’s caption: “This year, we are teaching the children to snorkel and like many things, fearless Arthur has taken to it like a fish to water and Dorothy is cheering from the sides after having her feet nibbled on our first venture into the sea!!”
