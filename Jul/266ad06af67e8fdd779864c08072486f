Emily Crossing discovered the arcade game at the Grand Pier in Weston-Super-Mare. Following her visit, the 30-year-old wrote to bosses at the North Somerset establishment telling them the game was "racist" and "outdated". The game features a saloon with a cowboy on the backdrop, and a gun for shooting moving Native American figures while the player is sat on a horse. The adult social care worker from Oxford says the bosses replied saying it was a "legacy piece" - later adding that nobody else had complained and that it was up to parents to police use. However, when approached for comment earlier this week, a spokesperson said the game had been removed. Emily said: "It's clearly racist. It's absolutely shocking. "Mum and I both just had our mouths open when we first saw it - we were in absolute shock. "The figures of indigenous Americans were in full-on headdresses and there are little 'cowboys' everywhere. "I can't believe the managers have no idea about cultural appropriation." Emily says she first emailed the company on May 29 after a visit earlier that month. She claims that they contacted the Grand Pier again over a month later, as she had not heard back. She says she then received a reply, which she says claimed the game was a legacy piece the company inherited when they bought the pier. Emily then posted on Instagram where she says she received messages of support. And she said: "This is 2022 - that game is racist whether you chose to play it or not. It's outdated and extremely shocking." As of July 12, the game was still available on the pier. But, when contacted on July 21, a Grand Pier spokesperson said: "That machine is no longer in our estate."
