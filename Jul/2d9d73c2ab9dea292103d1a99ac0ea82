 Scarlett Moffatt, 31, has taken to social media recently to share a stunning photo of younger sister Ava ahead of her school prom. The reality TV star complained that she felt “so old” as her 16-year-old sister looked so different from when she first joined the family on Gogglebox.  Ava looked gorgeous in a black halterneck jumpsuit for the occasion, which she matched with a stunning gold belt.  The star opted for bright make-up as she let her brunette locks fall to her shoulders in curls.  She then accessorised her look with dangling earrings and a gold arm cuff.  Ava posed in the shots as she held on to a mocktail, while grinning with excitement for her prom snaps.
