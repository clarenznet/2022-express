The first female gymnast to win medals FORTEAM GB at the Olympics, World and European Championships, and now a BBC pundit for the Commonwealth Games, said: "They love it or they hate it, but unless they're given the opportunity to try it, they'll never find out." "I want every child to experience gymnastics." Since retiring in 2013, she has launched BethTweddle Gymnastics, which has given thousands of youngsters the chance to try the sport. Beth, 37, said: "We work with 5,500 children every week in an after-school environment, and then hopefully we go on to work with these children doing our national curriculum work." "You should see the smile on a child's face when they first tell a parent they've done a forward roll. It's incredible." "Participation levels are going up and continuing to rise as more facilities pop up." Beth became a double world champion on the uneven bars as well as world champion on the floor exercise. She said: "I was very lucky to have that exposure to lots of different sports." "I tried swimming, athletics, hockey and finally gymnastics, and honestly for me, that was the one that really kind of took. But it's all about the opportunity. That's one of my main passions." Beth gave birth to son Finley in March, and also has a daughter Freya, three, with husband Andy Allen. She has been on ITV's Dancing On Ice and Channel 4's The Jump, on which she seriously injured her back. She is excited to be part of the BBC's commentary team again. She said: "I love doing it. I've got a great team."
