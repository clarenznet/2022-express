Jennifer Lopez, 53, and Ben Affleck, 49, walked hand in hand in Paris today as they visited the Louvre. The couple are on their honeymoon following their intimate Las Vegas wedding last week. They looked a little more serious than usual, which may have had something to do with Benâ€™s tearful appearance at dinner last night. He was pictured breaking down in tears at a restaurant with Jen. But in other photos from today, the newlyweds raised huge smiles as they continued to enjoy their trip with Ben's two children, Violet, 16, and Seraphina, 13, as well as Jennifer's child Emme, 14.
