Three Court of Appeal judges are due to deliver their findings on Monday after hearing final arguments in the case of 12-year-old Archie Battersbee yesterday. Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, of Southend in Essex, launched the appeal after High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden ruled last week that doctors could stop treatment at the Royal London Hospital.  Barrister Edward Devereux QC, for Archie's parents, said: "The overall case is that Mr Justice Hayden's decision was driven almost wholly by what is in Archie's medical best interests and not careful, clear, understandable and comprehensive evaluation of Archie's best interests in the wider sense."  Doctors think he is "brain-stem dead".
