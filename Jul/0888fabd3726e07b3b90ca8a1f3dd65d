Brooklyn Beckham, 23, cut a casual figure in white as he was joined by his wife Nicola Ann Peltz, 27, in Italy. The pair put on a loved-up display as they enjoyed a romantic stroll on their honeymoon in Portofino. Nicola showed off her sensational figure in a white crop top and flowing matching maxi skirt. The couple were seen browsing a clothing shop before heading to a restaurant for lunch. This comes after Nicola admitted in a recent interview that it wasn't love at first sight with her husband. She said the now-happy couple "didn't get long" and "didn't click" when they first met five years ago.
