Princess Eugenie has been a huge champion of the UN Ocean Conference which took place last week. The mother-of-one visited ‘The Science We Need for Reefs We Want’ event held by the Global Fund for Coral Reefs on Friday. Princess Eugenie, 32, posted the pictures on her Instagram story, sporting an ebony ‘Galaxy Flippy dress’ by the brand Whistles. Featuring long sleeves, a V-neck shape and a fit and flare silhouette, the dress was a striking piece. This was mainly due to its beautiful celestial print in shades of gold and cream. The dress was a repeat wear for the Princess and only costs £149. The stylish royal teamed the themed frock with a ‘Capucines Black Leather Bag’ from Louis Vuitton. The £4,730 bag is still available to purchase, and it looks so chic on Eugenie. The Princess accessorised with a pair of 'Dalston’ sunglasses in ‘Circular Cream/Leo Tortoise’ from Mr Boho. These £57.96 sunglasses are so popular that they are now out of stock. For footwear, the Princess wore a pair of midnight blue velvet flats by independent designer Charlotte Olympia.  However, these shoes contained a hidden detail. The shoes showcased Eugenie’s star sign, as they displayed an embroidered ram with the word 'Aries' written in needlework above the symbol. Eugenie was born on March 23, making her an Aries. She wore her auburn hair down loose in a gently styled blowdry and opted for a natural yet radiant makeup blend. Fans who adored the royal's outfit took to social media to express their praise. One fan, @christiinebeales wrote on Instagram: “Making good use of items she already has. Working wardrobe, not a fashion horse, well done!” Another fan, @carocatalfamo claimed: “I love the dress.” Similarly, royal fan @luxmeagainpreloved added: “Great fit – looks beautiful with flats. “Love all the re-wearing Eugenie is doing.
