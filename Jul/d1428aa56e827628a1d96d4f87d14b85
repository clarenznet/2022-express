Lorraine Kelly looked radiant at day eight of Wimbledon today. The 62-year-old beamed as she attended the centre court action, wearing a blue and white midi dress with an eye-catching lemon print at the hem, telling a fan on Instagram it was just £15 in Primark. ITV legend Lorraine nipped her waist in with a beige belt and clutched a yellow denim jacket in case the British weather turned. She looked happy and healthy after losing 1.5 stone in weight. Last month, the star posted a photo on Instagram to celebrate the exciting news that she had reached her goal with the help of WW, formerly known as Weight Watches. "GOAL REACHED! Lost one and a half stone!Feel healthier and happier Thank you @ww.uk and @wwsuzystirfry,” penned Lorraine.
