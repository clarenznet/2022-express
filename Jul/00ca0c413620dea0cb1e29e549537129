Oti Mabuse, 31, wowed crowds at her I Am Here tour in Canterbury on Saturday night, but narrowly avoided disaster when her costume did not open as it should have. The South African dancer strutted onto the stage to the track Mi Gente wearing a dazzling gold robe which cover her from head-to-toe.Oti ripped open the garment to reveal her sequinned jumpsuit underneath, but it did not open fully and was still attached in the middle.Oti noticed the blunder and, in what may have been an improvisation, she knelt down and swooped the cape off to the beat of the music.Sharing the clip to her Instagram story, Oti joked: “On this day! The robe decided to robe,” along with an embarrassed and laughing emoji.The original clip was uploaded by Oti’s friend, James Bennett, who wrote: “50th show!!! Oh my god!”
