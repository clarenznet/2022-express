Amanda Owen, 47, looked radiant as she spoke at the Game Fair in Warwickshire, along with other stars including James Martin. She looked radiant in a white summer dress, drawing in her toned figure. The shepherdess accessorised the puffy-sleeved dress with trainers, dangly earrings and lots of gold bangles. However, with a closer look her wedding band is missing from her ring finger. The mother-of-nine looked in great spirits as she posed with fans amid ending her 22-year marriage to Clive. A segment of the joint statement announcing the split said: "Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children."
