Madonna, 63, looked eternally youthful in beautiful new photos posted to her Instagram account, where she boasts 18.4million followers. The Like a Virgin singer uploaded a series of sultry snaps as she sat on a sofa clutching a glass of what looked like red wine. She looked impossibly perfect in her gown emblazoned with various artworks, and a stack of silver jewellery. Other photos showed her playing games such as Pictionary with some of her brood, who comprise Lourdes Leon, Rocco Ritchie, David Banda, Mercy, and twins Estere and Stella. “Last night we played Pictionary... I'm trying not to be a sore loser,” she wrote, alongside a clown emoji.
