Mr Justice Swift yesterday ruled a full judicial review can be held into part of the Duke of Sussex's complaint about the ending of automatic police protection for him and his family. Other parts were rejected at the High Court. US-based Harry, 37, wants the right to be able to pay for specialist guards with access to latest official intelligence. But the Home Office refused, saying rich individuals cannot buy such police protection. Harry, who quit his official royal roles in March 2020, is challenging a decision by the executive committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) to downgrade his security. His legal team claim revised arrangements, set out in a letter from Ravec when he visited the UK in June last year, were invalid as he was not given an opportunity to make "informed representations". Duke, earlier told the court Harry was unaware that senior figures in the Royal Household, including the Queen's private secretary Sir Edward Young with whom he had "significant tensions", were involved in the decision. She added: "He was told it was an independent decision." But lawyers for the Home Office said Ravec was entitled to decide his security on a "case by case" basis. The judge yesterday backed some claims, including that Ravec's decision was legally unreasonable and that Harry should have been told about the policy in advance. But he rejected that Harry should have been told who was on Ravec and that he did not have the chance to discuss their "appropriateness". The judge said: "There was no evidence at all to support a claim that any committee member had approached decisions with a closed mind, or that either decision was affected by bias." Mr Justice Swift noted the Home Office had not yet had the chance to detail the process by which Ravec took its decision and this would happen at the full hearing. He added that granting permission for a full hearing did not mean that Harry would necessarily win.
