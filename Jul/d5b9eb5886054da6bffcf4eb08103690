The relief from the thunderstorm comes days after the Met Office issued yellow warnings for various parts of the UK including Wales and Northern Ireland. The Met Office said the thunderstorms could trigger disruption including difficult driving conditions and delays on the roads and public transport.  According to the experts, the showers are going away with only a peppering across Britain on Friday. By Friday afternoon, the downpours will move over eastern Britain and northern Scotland before a new frontal system arrives over Northern Ireland and Gwynedd in Wales for Friday evening. Temperatures for the next few days will be 16 to 22C by day and around 10C by night. The frontal bands look more like a collection of hefty showers which move up through Scotland by Saturday morning, with the cold front line over north west England, Wales and south west England to start the weekend.  Ahead of the cold front will be sunshine but a brisk south westerly wind for England. Showers follow behind as the wind begins to veer to the northwest. Southeast England could see 21 to 24C at the weekend in the sunshine but elsewhere it will feel cool by night, with Sunday being the drier day. Terry Scholey, a meteorologist with Netweather.tv said: “Sunday should be the better day, although the northeast of Britain will continue to see showers.

Festival in Hyde Park and not too hot for the players at the Wimbledon championships. “Other events further north and west should also have a reasonable day in mostly light or moderate breezes from the west or north west. “Temperatures in central, southern and most eastern parts should reach warm or very warm 21 to 24C, but with 14 to 18C more likely further north.
