Johnny Depp's lawyer Camille Vasquez, 37, was pictured looking lovingly at her British boyfriend Edward Owen at the actor's recent Prague gig. Johnny has been touring around Europe with Jeff Beck for the last few months, performing hits from their new album 18. The happy couple were spotted laughing and joking backstage with the Pirates of the Caribbean star before Johnny pulled Edward in for a hug. Johnny also notices the fan videoing and makes sure to grin and wave at his supportive followers. This comes after Johnny won the recent high-profile defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard. The court ruled that Heard did defame her ex-husband in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed and has been ordered to pay the actor $10 million in compensation and $5 million in punitive damages.
