The industrial facility, located at Dalcross, near Inverness airport, is used for chipboard and plyboard production. It is known among locals as the "cloud factory" because it normally produces a significant amount of water vapour. It is the former Norbord plant, which is now part of the Canadian forestry company West Fraser Timber. A local resident, 24, from neighbouring Nairn, told Express.co.uk: "I think it's absolutely devastating. It's a well-loved place. "It's been known as the 'cloud factory' for many generations as many people see it every day on their way to work whether on the train, road or plane. "It also provides many jobs. I'm worried about what this means for the local community."
