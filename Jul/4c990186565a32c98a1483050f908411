Samsung fans can now buy a new Android-powered device at a much cheaper price thanks to a special event taking place on Amazon's website. The "7-days of Samsung Sale" has just started today with price cuts taking place every 24 hours until July 24. To kick things off, there is a swathe of bargains on Samsung's popular budget and mid-range Galaxy A and M devices with prices now starting from as little as £129. That very low cost is for Samsung's Galaxy M22 which features a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display, quad rear camera and huge 5,000mAh battery. This device is usually priced at £199 so there is a £70 saving to be made. If you want something a little more powerful then there are some other top deals including £70 off the Galaxy M52 5G which offers speedy downloads and a fast Octa-core processor. There's also a 6.7-inch Infinity-O Display, a large battery and the option to boost the internal storage to 1TB via a microSD card. Another deal that's worth checking out is a big reduction to the M23 5G which now costs just £209.
