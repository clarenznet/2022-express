Oti Mabuse, 31, has taken to Instagram in a photo in which she appears to be cuddling up to her sisters as they were reunited for the first time in five years. The Strictly star shared a snap with her two sisters, Motsi and Phemelo, and a friend as they held drinks and grinned for the camera.  In the snap, she can be seen wearing a stunning yellow crop top with a zebra patterned short skirt as she smiled happily for the shot.  She wrote in the caption: “Can you Believe it all of us together for the first time in 5 years… as 3 sisters!  “We talk everyday but it felt like we’ve seen each other everyday as well, like we didn’t skip a beat…(sic).  "Living in 3 different corners of the earth, covid, work, timing, life…. All of it gets in the way but this was SUCH AN AMAZING MOMENT."
