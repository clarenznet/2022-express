Slashing the headline figure of 20 per cent would reduce the tax bill burden for millions of people. Steve Barclay, the Prime Minister's chief of staff, reportedly suggested reducing the rate temporarily - but the Treasury warned this could fuel inflation by overstimulating the economy. And cutting it to 17.5 per cent would cost the Government about Â£18billion. John O'Connell, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: "Now's the time to help growth go gangbusters by giving taxpayers respite from tax rises." Alistair Darling, a former Labour chancellor, cut VAT from 17.5 to 15 per cent immediately after the financial crisis in 2008, an approach credited with helping the economic recovery. However, Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, commented: "Inflation was not the issue at that time and aVAT cut was appropriate then. "At the moment, ramping up demand when there are clear supply-side constraints has the potential to make the situation more problematic." Boris Johnson has vowed to cut taxes, having called them the "biggest single household outgoing" - but with little action, his backbenchers are growing impatient for him to prioritise tax cuts over infrastructure spending. Figures show the number of people due to be subjected to the higher tax bracket will reach 6.1 million this year, up from 4.3 million in 2019.
