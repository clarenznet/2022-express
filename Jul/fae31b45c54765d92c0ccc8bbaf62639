The comedian, 77, has been told he needs a crucial hip operation so he has put his latest tour on hold. He has been "relying on pain injections" to carry on performing, and using a walking frame to get around the house. A hip replacement will be completed in the coming weeks so Roy's manager, Ritchie Hoyle, said he had to "reschedule" a number of gig dates around the UK and in Gran Canaria or Tenerife, where the comic was due to perform in September. Mr Hoyle has apologised to disappointed fans, reports Teesside Live. He said: "Roy has been really struggling with his hip for the last few months," he said, "he's had three painkilling injections which wear off after six or seven weeks, just to keep him going on tour. He can’t keep relying on injections to take the pain away, while the hip deteriorates. "When the consultant explained that, if a replacement operation isn’t performed ASAP, Roy could end up in a wheelchair in less than a year's time as the hip is crumbling away, it left me with no choice but to make the decision that Roy will have to take eight or nine weeks off from the tour with immediate affect. "I have to put Roy’s health and well being above all else, I can only apologise for any disappointment, inconvenience or frustration caused, I know true Chubby fans will understand and be fully supportive of my decision."  The funnyman was "cancelled" by officials at Lancaster City Council, who scrapped his August show at one of their venues last week. The authority said Roy's shows do not reflect its values of "fairness, inclusion and diversity". But Mr Hoyle defended the stand-up performer, famed for his forthright social commentary and disdain for political correctness. His boss said: "Everyone knows the content of Chubby’s shows. "If you can’t see it for what it is, comedy, then don’t buy a ticket."
