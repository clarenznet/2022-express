The driver of the black car was pulled over by police on Monday (July 25) after he stayed in the middle lane of the A3 unnecessarily. Officers then found the man did not have a driving licence. Surrey Police shared information about the job online and were praised for taking the motor. The full statement from the force's roads policing unit read: "Driver of this Toyota was seen hogging the middle lane of the A3, Guildford by the #VanguardRST. Once stopped it was established he didn’t have a valid driving licence. Vehicle seized Driver reported." As Surrey Live reports, people rejoiced online. "Good job, well done," wrote one woman. "Another menace off the road, yay," another stated. Rule 264 of the Highway Code states: "You should always drive in the left-hand lane when the road ahead is clear. If you are overtaking a number of slow-moving vehicles, you should return to the left-hand lane as soon as you are safely past." According to the RAC middle lane hogging can cause congestion as traffic funnels through outside lines to get around the driver whereas if the driver moved over the traffic could be split into two lanes. Many see it as selfish as someone who follows the Highway Code correctly and keeps to the left needs to move across two lanes to correctly overtake the vehicle. While it is not a specific offence, middle-lane hogging comes under careless driving in the same bracket as running a red light. New laws introduced in 2013 give police the power to hand out £100 fines on the spot and three penalty points to your licence. It comes after a retired police officer blasted middle lane hoggers in Yorkshire. Martin Willis stepped down from his role with West Yorkshire Police this week after 21 years of service.
