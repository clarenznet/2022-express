Cristiano Ronaldo could be offered the chance to realise his Champions League ambitions at Napoli if he leaves Manchester United this summer, according to a new report. The Portuguese veteran has made it clear that he would like to leave Old Trafford in the coming weeks. Speculation had been rife over Ronaldo's future after United failed to qualify for the Champions League, and it now appears as though the 37-year-old, who only returned to the club last summer, is set for a swift exit from the Premier League giants. A new report from The Athletic has outlined some of the clubs that could offer Ronaldo an escape route from United this summer, and Napoli have emerged as shock contenders to acquire the former Real Madrid man's services. The thought of Ronaldo leaving the club for Napoli would have been unthinkable as recently as 12 months ago; highlighting just how badly United have declined over the past year. Bayern Munich and Chelsea would also be interested in snapping up the striker, who notched 24 goals in all competitions for the Red Devils last term.

Ronaldo has played in the Champions League ever since he first arrived at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon back in 2003 and has no desire to play in the Europa League next term. Ronaldo's bombshell will come as a bitter blow to new United boss Erik ten Hag, who is bidding to revive the club's fortunes on and off the pitch after their nightmare campaign last year. But the Dutchman now looks set to lose the last season's top scorer just days after the start of pre-season.

It is believed that United are finally closing in on signings though, with left-back Tyrell Malacia on the verge of joining the club after United hijacked a bid from Lyon at the eleventh hour. A deal for Frenkie de Jong is also edging closer after weeks of negotiations, while United have also reportedly tabled an improved bid to Ten Hag's former club, Ajax, in a bid to snap up versatile defender Lisandro Martinez. United have also been linked with a move for Martinez's teammate, Antony - and that interest could be accelerated if Ronaldo actually does depart Old Trafford in the coming weeks.
