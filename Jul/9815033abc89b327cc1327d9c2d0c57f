The former Culture Secretary joined David to play a leading role in delivering the London 2012 Olympics. She died from a brain tumour in 2018. The Tessa Jowell Foundation is organising the release of a film of the 2012 opening ceremony to be screened in cinemas across the country, with the proceeds going to the foundation. The group is hoping to raise Â£4million for brain cancer care. David said: "Brain cancer is the biggest cancer killer of children and people under 40 in the UK." "As a close friend of Tessa, it is my honour to help support her family foundation to deliver her final campaign - to transform NHS brain cancer care in Britain."
