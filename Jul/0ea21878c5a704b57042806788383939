The Countess of Wessex, 57, joined her husband Prince Edward, 58, and her 96-year-old mother-in-law as the trio ventured north of the border to mark Holyrood week in Scotland. Sophie, who tied the knot with the Earl of Wessex in 1999, even paid respect to her late father-in-law the Duke of Edinburgh by planting a rose in memory of Prince Philip at a charity where he was the former patron. However, the mother-of-two has since received praise from a royal expert for her role in the Firm. Jennie Bond, 71, who worked as a BBC royal correspondent from 1989 to 2003, penned a piece for inews.co.uk in which she highlighted the role Sophie plays in the Royal Family. After detailing her early encounters with the Countess and an incident in the Middle East involving a News of the World reporter which left Sophie "utterly humiliated", Ms Bond revealed how the Wessexes "wound up" their non-royal careers. She said: "It was the moment that both Edward and Sophie realised that their ambition to be royals with careers who earned their living was not feasible.  "Prince Edward wound up his TV production firm and Sophie gave up her PR career. "Since then the Wessexes have knuckled down to their lives as full-time working royals. "They are very much in demand and I have seen them in action. "Edward is fun and funny; Sophie has focused on difficult issues such as sexual violence against women and girls. "And she has taken on board the lesson that she is not there to advise or steer a charity as she did as a PR consultant." Comparing the Countess to Diana, Ms Bond added: "There is something of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, about Sophie. "She often avoids publicity about her work. "Earlier this year she spent her 57th birthday volunteering at a Covid vaccination centre."  Ms Bond concluded: "There is no doubt that Sophie’s star is in the ascendancy. "She may be the monarchy’s secret weapon whenever the going gets tough."
