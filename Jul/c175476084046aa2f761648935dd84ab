This week we will kick off a programme of hustings right across the UK to choose the next leader of the Conservative Party – and our next Prime Minister. It is a responsibility we take extremely seriously. We are now a party that has growing strength across every region, reflecting our mission to spread prosperity and opportunity to everyone, no matter where you live. I know our members will ask probing questions but give each candidate a fair hearing. After all, this is not a tea party, this leadership election will decide our next PM and robust debate is part of that. I am also extremely proud of the strong slate of candidates we’ve had. With six with ethnic minority heritage and four women, this was the most diverse and talented range of candidates for any leadership election in history; one Labour and the Lib Dems, for all their talk, could only dream of. And unlike Labour, we do not need forced quotas or shortlists for talent to rise to the top. We have had such a diverse pool of talent because it’s the Conservative Party that is truly the home of opportunity, aspiration and meritocracy. While I as party chairman am neutral, I believe in Liz and Rishi we have two fantastic candidates who can tackle the big issues and take our country forward. And come September, we will either have our third female Prime Minister or our first from Asian heritage, and that’s something to celebrate in a modern dynamic Britain.
