Archie Battersbee, 12, was declared brain dead after collapsing at his home and has been in a coma in hospital in the several weeks since. Doctors can now stop providing this life-support treatment after reviewing evidence, which suggested the theraphy is not in his best interests. The hearing in London was told damage to Archie's brain has "deprived him of any bodily autonomy". Mr Justice Hayden said: "Archie’s mother described him as a fighter and I have no doubt he was...but the fight, if it can properly be characterised as such, is no longer in Archie’s control. "The damage to his brain has deprived him of any bodily autonomy. Eventually Archie’s organs will fail and ultimately his heart will stop. "The medical evidence finds that for Archie improvement is not possible. There is unfortunately no treatment possible to reverse the damage that has been caused to Archie’s brain. "There can be no hope at all of recovery." But parents Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, both in court today with other members of the family, have always said their son would want to fight to the end, Mirror Online reports.  The family, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, have fought the medical advice from Barts Health NHS Trust. And today a lawyer representing Archie’s parents indicated they will try to challenge Mr Justice Hayden’s ruling. The youngster suffered a "devastating" brain injury at home on April 7. His mother previously said he may have been taking part in the dangerous "blackout" social media craze , where people choke themselves until they pass out. Archie's parents want his life support to continue in case he miraculously recovers. The Court of Appeal was earlier told Archie and his mother had a brief conversation one or two years ago where he said he would like to remain alive if he ever found himself in such a situation. He is said to have told his mother: "I wouldn't care, I wouldn't feel anything."
