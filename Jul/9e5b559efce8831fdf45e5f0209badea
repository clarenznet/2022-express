The former chancellor signalled his determination to stamp out so-called “down-blousing” – building on a law recently introduced to ban upskirting. Mr Sunak also wants maximum life sentences for ringleaders of grooming gangs who prey on children and young women. Members will automatically face criminal charges for belonging to or facilitating the activity of a gang. Mr Sunak, who was visiting Newmarket, Suffolk, said: “As a father of two girls, I want them to be able to go for a walk in the evening or to a shop at night without any fear of threat. As prime minister I will make it a criminal offence if you harass women by taking intimate images of them without their consent and will introduce a major crackdown on grooming gangs. “We can not let sensitivities over race stop us from catching dangerous criminals who prey on women, and I will not stop until we live in a society where women and girls can go about their lives feeling safe and secure.” Mr Sunak also plans a task force to investigate any town or city where significant grooming activity has been found. He also wants a National Grooming Gangs Whistleblower Network. And his government will consider denying parole for any gang member convicted of rape who still poses a risk.
