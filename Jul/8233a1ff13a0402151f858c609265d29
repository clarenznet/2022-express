There are around 2.7 million North American greys. They carry a virus that kills 99 per cent of infected native reds and cause £40million worth of damage to trees. A Government-approved scheme involves luring the grey squirrels into feeding boxes, using pots containing hazelnut spread spiked with contraceptives. Environment minister Lord Benyon said: “Important research on oral contraception shows promising signs that could help to eradicate the grey squirrel in the UK in a non-lethal way.”
