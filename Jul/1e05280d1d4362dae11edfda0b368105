Princess Charlene, 44, stepped out for a solo engagement on Monday. The Princess, 44, who shares seven-year-old twins Gabriella and Jacques with husband Prince Albert, 64, paid a visit to patients, staff and families at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre, the only public hospital in Monaco. Charlene is slowly readjusting to royal duties after remaining largely out of the public eye over the last 18 months.  She spent 10 months in her native South Africa last year after contracting a sinus infection that later required surgery. For this occasion, Charlene made a royal visit to the maternity ward at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre. The Princess looked beautiful in a new Akris Official gown, which is a Swiss company. The ‘Bicolour wool-silk belted midi dress’ cost an outstanding £2,112.49. Charlene’s black and white dress featured a boat neckline and was sleeveless. The midi dress also included a self-tie belted waist. Charlene paired the dress with some black and white strappy stiletto heels. The Princess kept her blonde hair nice and short, whilst wearing a face mask to protect from coronavirus.  The mask was white, however it featured red ear straps. This formed the colours of the flag of Monaco, which was a touching choice to add to the outfit. Royal fans took to social media to praise Charlene’s style. Instagram user @tinanoha_ said: “I liked this choice of shoes in two colours.
