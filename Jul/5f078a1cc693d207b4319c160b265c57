I do not think he is a serial liar. He is just plain chaotic. He was a really successful Mayor of London because he had a very good organisation around him. He began well enough as PM because he had Dominic Cummings. Since Dominic he has not had anybody saying to him: “Shut up, Prime Minister.” It is entirely practical for him to stay on until October: all leaders have overseen the election for their successor. Just because he has resigned does not mean he will go out of Number 10 that day. This has been massively damaging for the country, for Ukraine, for the party and damaging for everything. I think everybody just got to the stage where they could not see a way out. As for Brexit, it is now in serious danger on the basis that if they do not get a Brexiteer, I think we are going to see closer ties with the European Union.  The only real Brexiteer is Rishi. I think he was a lousy Chancellor, we have had no tax cuts, we have had nothing imaginative. He has not used Brexit to take VAT off fuel but if I want Brexit then I suppose I want Rishi. When it comes to sorting out Northern Ireland, I can see big concessions being made to the EU and that is real trouble. I think they could pull the plug on this Northern Ireland Protocol Bill for a start.
