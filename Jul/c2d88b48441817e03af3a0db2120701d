A snap survey conducted on Wednesday afternoon and yesterday by TechneUK for this website found 42 Ms Truss was leading the former Chancellor by just one percentage point among 2019 Tory voters. It found the Foreign Secretary was the top choice to replace Boris Johnson for 43 percent of the 1,629 people surveyed, while Mr Suank was the pick for 42 percent. The findings will be a huge boost to Mr Sunak's campaign after repeated suggestions this week that he is unpopular among the Conservative grassroots. There have been suggestions Ms Truss was the overwhelming favourite among the party's membership to take on the top job. The former Chancellor has described himself as the "underdog" in the leadership contest despite being the most popular candidate among MPs after winning the backing of 137 MPs in the final vote, while Ms Truss was supported by 113.
