Taking the spice in pill form brought on variations in heart rate – pointing to stress reduction – and greater enjoyment of exercise. But female subjects of a study in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition were not affected this way. The group took 28mg of Pharmactive’s saffron extract, called affron, daily for six weeks. Alberto Espinel, of Pharmactive, said: “Saffron may even positively interact with gut flora, which affects the nervous system.” The yellow spice, often used in curries and with fish, comes from the flower saffron crocus.
