Living sustainably is becoming more important as costs of living is rising and an easy way to cut down is by reevaluating the use of household appliances. With this in mind, there’s a £40 kettle on Amazon that shoppers praise for reducing energy. One kettle requires 1200W and 3000W to boil and with the UK drinking an average of 100 million cups of tea daily, it’s no wonder that energy reduction has become an important topic to many. An easy way to reduce energy is to switch to using a eco kettle as it is designed to use less power with each boil. While it can be hard to find energy efficient kettles, Amazon shoppers are praising the Russell Hobbs Illuminating Glass Kettle for its ability to save costs. On sale for £40 from £77.99, it’s a must-have to reduce energy in any home. The Russell Hobbs Illuminating Glass Kettle has a 1.7 litre capacity and saves up to 66 percent off energy saving by boiling one cup, which is 235ml, as opposed to one litre. Do make sure that at least two minutes have passed in between using it and that there’s always 25cl of water in the kettle. Customers love its style and energy efficiency as it illuminates blue when heating the water.
