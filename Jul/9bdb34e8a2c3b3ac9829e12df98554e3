Rose and William Howard were clear on the sum they were owed after they had to pull out of a holiday in Scarborough they had booked months in advance. ++ If you've been affected by this issue or feel you've been a victim of injustice, please contact consumer champion Maisha Frost on maisha.frost@express.co.uk ++; Theirs was a very reluctant decision and only because it had taken more time than Rose had hoped to recover from a hip operation. The stay was with Leisureplex Hotels, a company the couple had booked with many times before, and arranged through tour operator Alfa Travel. The Howards paid a £100 deposit and also wisely followed advice to take out travel cover too, paying £15 each. This was done through Alfa, and its policy with ETI, the trading name of ERGO Travel Insurance Services. After cancelling two months before departure, Rose and William made a claim for return of their deposit. “We sent every document they asked for, but that was almost six months ago and we haven’t heard,” William told Crusader and asked if we could give ETI a nudge. ETI sent the couple £80 – very welcome, but a sum that was less than they were expecting. Unsure whether this was an excess charge or what else was going on,  one thing was certain however and that was Rose and William had had a very long wait so Crusader thought it was worth querying again the amount they received. And that turned out to be a good move as Ergo stepped up, explaining delays were because of Covid disruption but “could have been less protracted … and there was some confusion about the excess amount applicable to their claim”. A further refund has now happened and the happy Howards have got their due. Even for short trips in the UK, taking out travel insurance is worth it. Before buying, check the cancellation cover terms, make sure you supply accurate details about any existing medical conditions and check any excess charge on a claim.
