Heidi Klum, 49, looked sensational in her latest bikini snap as she posed topless with a skimpy pair of hot pink bikini bottoms. The model displayed her enviable figure as she posed makeup-free in front of a picturesque backdrop. Heidi ditched her makeup and wore her long, blonde tresses down to cover her modesty. She then used her hand to cover the rest of her chest and stunned as she stood in front of mountains and a lake. Sharing the snap to Instagram, Heidi added the caption: “Boy it’s H️OT.”
