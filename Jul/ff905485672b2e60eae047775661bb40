Writing on Twitter, commentator Nile Gardiner described Harry and Meghan as an "embarrassment on the world stage", adding: "Their political activism and attacks on the United States are undermining the British Monarchy. Fundamentally wrong for royals to be engaging in US politics." This came after Meghan Markle waded into the debate over the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the US, an intervention which Mr Gardiner described as being "fundamentally wrong". Meghan denounced the decision to pull back abortion rights in the US, saying it tells women that their "physical safety doesn't matter". Prince Harry was also mocked by a US judge for using his speech at the UN to criticise the "rolling back of constitutional rights" and a "global assault on democracy and freedom".
