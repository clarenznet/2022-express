Kate Middleton, 40, stepped out today in Windsor donning a gorgeous white dress for a polo match. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived at the Out-Sourcing Inc charity polo match at Guards Polo Club, Smiths Lawn, Windsor.  The match is to raise funds and awareness for 10 charities supported by Kate and William. For today's occasion, Kate wore a gorgeous white belted cloque dress by Emilia Wickstead. The midi dress retails for a whopping £1,352. This is a dress previously worn by Ivanka Trump, the daughter of former President Donald Trump. It is a white sleeveless dress with a white belt around its centre. It also features straight black vertical lines down either side of the dress and at the front.
