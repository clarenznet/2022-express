Every driver knows that speed bumps can be a menace, especially when fuel prices skyrocket. The constant slowing down and acceleration negatively affect fuel consumption and lead to motorists spending much more money on petrol and diesel. However, there is a trick that allows drivers to improve their car’s fuel economy while driving on roads filled with the speed-limiting obstacles. According to experts at Euro Car Parts, many motorists are unaware that constantly driving at one speed through speed bump-filled roads can massively improve the fuel economy. They said: “Acceleration and deceleration whilst driving can mean extra fuel is used, and this includes driving over speed bumps, so learning how to properly tackle them could save motorists a lot of money. “Drivers can avoid unnecessary fuel consumption by driving at a constant speed and avoiding accelerating or braking too often in between speed bumps, which is when most fuel is used.” READ MORE: Drivers warned of huge £5,000 fines for not using air con this summer The RAC’s Rebecca Jackson added: "To set any kind of fuel efficiency world record you have to be looking ahead as much as possible to pre-empt oncoming hazards. "This is a good general driving habit. "It’s all about keeping moving and not losing momentum. "Accelerating from being stopped is very costly in fuel consumption terms and so is going up any steep incline.

"You need to listen to the engine to make sure you don’t use excessive revs but you need to use enough, so it’s a fine balance as you don’t want the car to be labouring too much either." The news comes as British motorists continue to face extremely high costs of fuel. The latest RAC Fuel Watch indicates that drivers will have to pay 189.46p per litre of unleaded.

While the forecast shows that both prices should fall in the coming days, it might still take a while for drivers to see a considerable difference. Speaking about the crisis earlier this year, the RAC fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “More radical government intervention is urgently needed, whether that’s in the form of a further reduction in fuel duty or a VAT cut. “As it is, drivers surely won’t be able to cope unless something is done to help. “This is fast becoming a national crisis for the country’s 32 million car drivers as well as countless businesses.” The AA fuel price spokesperson, Luke Bosdet, added: “Shock and awe is the only way to describe what has been happening at the pumps.”
