Bruce Willis, 67, had recently announced his plans to retire from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition affecting speech and communication. However he proved that fans certainly haven't heard the last of him yet in a triumphant video posted by his wife, 44-year-old Emma Heming Willis, on Instagram. In it, the acting legend referenced his action hero roots with an emotional return to the rooftop of Fox Plaza (Nakatomi Plaza) in Century City, Los Angeles, while the sound of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony played in the background. During the film, Bruce's character, John McClane, told the world he'd “never even think about going up in a tall building again” - and yet, to fans' delight, that is exactly what the star found himself doing. It was his first time recreating the scenes in almost three and a half decades, after the 34th anniversary of the filming fell this week.
