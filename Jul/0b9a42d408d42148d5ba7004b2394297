Nick Kyrgios has admitted he holds a lot of "love" for Stefanos Tsitsipas despite calling for the Greek tennis ace to be kicked out of their match on Court One this evening in what proved to be an explosive affair. Kyrgios against Tsitsipas was always going to be must-watch TV but nobody foresaw what would take place on Saturday night.  Kyrgios held the better record, winning three of the four matches between the pair. The last came at the Halle Open with Kyrgios kicking off at times during the match. The two rivals shared an amiccable exchange after that clash, but it looked as though their friendship was going to be tested on Court One. The British crowd were fully behind Kyrgios from the outset and Tsitsipas was trying everything to ignore the noise. The No 4 seed soon began facing boos from the crowd for his attempts to recompose himself while Kyrgios mouthed out at the umpire and line judges. But after losing the second set, Tsitsipas smashed a ball into the crowd and that saw Kyrgios call for his opponent to be defaulted.  The two shared words at times as they crossed paths too with the contest growing more and more tetchy by the second. Kyrgios eventually won the match to a rapturous reception inside Court One, but the two tennis stars shared a warm embrace at the net. And the 27-year-old has seemingly already put any bad blood between them from the match behind him. "I'm just super happy to be through," Kyrgios said.  "He was getting frustrated at times and it's a frustrating sport thats for sure. You all think you can play but it's very frustrating so I've got ultimate respect for him. "Whatever happens on the court, I love him. I'm quite close to his brother so I don't care."
