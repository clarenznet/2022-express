It has recently been reported half of the BBC’s 74 top on-screen earners received a pay rise last year. One of the recipients of the staggering pay rise includes BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Nunchetty, who is one of the biggest benefactors getting an extra £110,000. The increase in pay means she now receives a massive £365,000 a year for her work on the morning show. Naga's increase is the second-highest, with Amol Rajan leading the way in first place for the biggest increase. Despite the increase in pay for Naga, she isn't the highest earner for the broadcaster as Gary Lineker still takes the cake. The former football star is the only name to earn over £1million annually. Gary was paid between £1,350,000 and £1,354,999 in 2021/2022 for work including Match Of The Day and Sports Personality Of The Year.

He first topped the list for 2017/18 with a pay bracket of £1,750,000 to £1,759,999, and in 2020 it was announced he had taken a voluntary pay cut. Alongside Naga and Gary, Radio 1 DJ Greg James joined the top 10 list for the first time, earning between £390,000 and £394,999. However, Zoe Ball remains the broadcaster's second-highest-paid talent, with a salary of £980,000 to £984,999. Other benefactors to join the list include Alan Shearer, Steve Wright, Lauren Laverne, Michael Vaughan, Victoria Derbyshire, and Graham Norton. The increase in pay for the BBC legends come after a flurry of colleagues decided to leave the broadcaster for other projects. Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel, Andrew Marr and Dan Walker have all left for rival broadcasters. The BBC recently confirmed the licence fee will be frozen for two years, culture minister Nadine Dorries said the agreement "gives the broadcaster certainty while protecting the public from a price hike".

She took over the role from Emma Barnett back in October 2020 and said at the time: "I’m absolutely thrilled to be joining the 5 Live team. "I have always wanted to work more on radio, and after such an enjoyable experience presenting on the station recently, I jumped at this opportunity. “5 Live has one of the most passionate, engaged audiences in radio. The prospect of talking to those listeners every week really excites me." Naga joined BBC Breakfast and has been reading the national news bulletins since 2010, giving the nation the news for the morning. She previously admitted she didn't think she would be part of the team for as long as she has. "I'm certainly here longer than I thought I'd be for many reasons," she told her listeners on Radio 5 Live. “But I always had a view that to move around, move jobs, move companies is a healthy thing."
