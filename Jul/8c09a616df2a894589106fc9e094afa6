Elizabeth Hurley, 57, looked glamorous as the Royal star posed alongside her son Damian Hurley, 20, and the model's ex-husband Arun Nayar. Arun is not Damian's biological father, but Liz has previously said she always considered him his dad after getting married when Damian was five. The trio looked chic in the photo as they celebrated Damian's graduation on Monday. The British actor and model - who has been at drama school - captioned the post: "Mama and Daddyo at graduation with mee!" Arun was married to Elizabeth from 2007 to 2011 but they remained good friends after they divorced.
