Equalities minister Kemi Bade­noch is leading proposals to prevent non-residential properties from being fitted with universal facilities. The plans will include changes to building and planning regulations to ensure separate stalls and partitions be installed in current unisex toilets. Ms Badenoch claimed last week that some pupils are avoiding going to the toilet during school hours because they only have access to gender-neutral lavatories. She insists it is important to provide single-sex spaces after revelations that women were finding it hard to locate single-sex facilities. The plans are seen as a “common sense” way of putting a halt to gender-neutral toilets being installed as the default option. Parents were furious in April when a £7million children’s play area in Brentwood, Essex, was fitted with such facilities.  And last week, new guidance told civil servants they should let people who identify as transgender use whichever single-sex toilet they want. The National Trust was also accused of pursuing a woke agenda after introducing gender-neutral toilets at Tredegar House in Newport, South Wales, when a woman saw a man urinating with the door open. A review was launched by former communities secretary Robert Jenrick’s department in November following several complaints. A Government source said: “It is vital women feel safe and comfortable when using public facilities and that there is a greater emphasis on dignity, privacy, tolerance and respect for all.” It has been reported that NHS hospitals have spent more than £800,000 on gender-neutral toilets in the past four years.
