Johnny Depp, 59, has been touring the UK and Europe with Jeff Beck since his defamation trial with Amber Heard ended, and today travelled to the city of Hesse in Germany to continue the tour. He was wearing four different layers of clothing despite the warm weather, including a grey and white plaid shirt which hung open, and a khaki coloured jacket. Although his jacket was in a shade of army green, his fight is over for now, with ex-wife Amber Heard having been found guilty on three counts of defamation. She has been requested to pay him $15 million, but has indicated that she is likely to appeal the verdict. Meanwhile the Pirates of the Caribbean star paused to hug visibly emotional fans outside the Stadthalle Offenbach concert venue. The actor has been taking steps to try to restore his reputation following his six-week long court trial, and has been meeting and greeting fans everywhere he goes. He recently used the proceeds from sales of his own brand NFTs to make donations to various children's hospitals, including the Perth Children's Hospital Foundation, the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, the Footprint Coalition and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Johnny announced via his Instagram Stories today that his new single, The Death and Resurrection Show, is available to hear now.
