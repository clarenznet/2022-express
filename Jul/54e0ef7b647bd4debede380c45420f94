Sterling has signed a five-year deal worth £300,000 a week with an option for a further season. He was due to train with his new team-mates yesterday and could make his debut Saturday's pre-season friendly against Club America in Nevada. Sterling said: "I've achieved a lot in my career but there's so much more to come and I'm really looking forward to doing that in a Chelsea shirt." New Chelsea co-owner Boehly said: "Raheem is a serial winner. His signing is an important step in strengthening our squad." Kimpembe has played 28 times for France, and PSG understood to be willing to do business at the right price for the centre-back. The Blues have agreed a £34m deal plus add-ons to sign defender Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli. The 31-year-old arrived in London last night ahead of a medical today.
