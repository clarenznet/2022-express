Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, suggested ending his Caribbean country’s historic ties with the British monarchy. He told his parliament: “I am prepared, if the opposition agrees, before the end of the year or early next year to put one question in a referendum – to have a home-grown president, a non-executive president.” The island chain includes Mustique, where Princess Margaret had a holiday home and was once pictured with tough guy actor John Bindon. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also holidayed in Mustique in 2019. Dr Gonsalves failed to get the necessary support for a similar move in a referendum in 2009. It comes after Jamaica has vowed to remove the Queen as head of state by 2025, with Barbados replacing her with a president last November.
