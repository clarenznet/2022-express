Day Five at Wimbledon saw men's top seed Novak Djokovic breeze into round four, and again there was plenty for British fans to celebrate. Heather Watson and Cameron Norrie both made it into the last-16 at SW19 for the first time in their respective careers, and on Friday both will enjoy a well-earned day off singles action. Instead, home hopes will rest with Katie Boulter, following her fairytale win over sixth seed Karolina Plisova on Centre Court on Thursday. Unfortunately for spectators though, Boulter has been overlooked for a slot on the showpiece court. She'll be first up on Court 2 against Harmony Tan, the player who dramatically knocked out Serena Williams in a marathon first round match. Rafael Nadal will continue his quest for a calendar Grand Slam when he returns to Centre Court to face 27th seed Lorenzo Sonego. The Spaniard, yet to hit his best form so far, will be third on, with teenager Coco Gauff opening up against American compatriot Amanda Anisimova. Court 1 won't be short on entertainment either, with Boulter's boyfriend Alex de Minaur playing another British hopeful in Liam Broady. And after women's No 1 seed Iga Swiatek plays Alize Cornet, spectators will be guaranteed some box-office material when the colourful Nick Kyrgios takes on fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, a clash with the potential to thrill.
