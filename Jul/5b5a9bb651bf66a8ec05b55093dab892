Encore is recalling the Beef Selection in Gravy dog food as a precaution because the Beef Steak with Potatoes in Gravy tin inside the multipack may contain small pieces of metal. Anyone who has bought the product is being urged not to feed it to their pets and to return it with or without the receipt for a full refund. Encore said in an alert on the Food Standards Agency website: "Encore is recalling its multipack Beef Selection in Gravy because the Beef Steak with Potatoes in Gravy tin (156g) may contain small pieces of metal, which is only sold as part of a multipack."

No other Encore products have been affected by the recall.

"The Encore helpdesk is also available here. "We're sorry for any inconvenience this precautionary recall may cause. "No other Encore products are affected by this recall." It comes after a vet warned that many owners are feeding "dangerous" treats to their dogs. Rory Cowlam, vet on CBBC’s The Pets Factor, said: "Speaking as a dog owner and vet, I find it incredibly hard to find a long-lasting, healthy, easily digestible chew for Nala and my clients. “I know how important it is to treat your pet to build that amazing bond, but as these shocking results show a large proportion of people are still feeding dangerous treats to their dogs. “Dog owners need to stop feeding cooked bones - particularly chicken as these will often splinter and become very sharp leading to a risk of gut perforation and very serious issues. “I generally avoid raw hide too - it’s really tricky to digest and can cause both gut and tooth issues.”
