Day Six at Wimbledon saw Rafael Nadal dominate, Iga Swiatek crash out and Nick Kyrgios - for better or worse - captivate. Unfortunately, Liam Broady missed out on a place in the fourth round as the Brit was crushed by Alex de Minaur at the All England Club. Nadal won in straight sets as he dominated Italian star Lorenzo Sonego to win 6-1 6-2 6-4. It means the World No. 4 will face 21st seed Botic van de Zandschulp in the Round of 16. Women’s World No. 1 Iga Swiatek - the French Open champion - saw her winning streak come to an end in stunning fashion against Alize Cornet. The Pole held the longest winning record in women’s tennis this century, but the 37-game strong streak came to a crashing end on Court One as she slipped to a 6-4 6-2 loss. Finally, Kyrgios and Stefonos Tsitsipas put on a dramatic clash for the ages to close out the day’s play on Court 1. Both players were issued warnings in a feisty contest, with the Australian coming out on top 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-3 7-6 (9-7).
