Well, with the jaw-dropping revelations about Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher allegedly drunkenly groping two men at the Carlton Club the Tory Party now has the requisite three. 1 Former Tory MP for Wakefield Imran Ahmad Khan currently serving 18 months at Her Majesty's pleasure for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after plying him with gin. 2 Tractor porn ex-Tory MP for Tiverton and Honiton Neil Parish who quit after admitting watching pornography in the House of Commons - twice. 3 Possibly soon to be ex-MP for Tamworth (if the runes are right) Christopher Pincher who has been forced to quit the Whip's office on grounds of sexual impropriety - for the SECOND time. This is truly horrible stuff. It is also incredibly damaging - and so it should be damaging. There's no greased-pig way out of this. Labour Party strategists are no doubt already planning their assault on his Tamworth seat. While it has become almost de riguer to take Boris' sexual to-ings and fro-ings as so much boys will be boys the idea of there being three MPs catapulted into the spotlight for varying degrees of sexual misbehaviour in one Government might just be too much for the average voter to bear. There's so much wrong with Pincher's pitiful "I was drunk" mea culpa it makes your head spin. He's 52 for God's sakes, not some teenager experimenting with his first pint of lager. First off why was he in the job in the first place? He resigned in 2017 after Conservative candidate Alex Story - an Express.co.uk regular - complained Pincher had made unwanted advances. Pincher referred himself to the police. No action was taken by police and the Party cleared him of any wrongdoing. Alex is a 6ft 8ins former Olympic rower. Wonder if the police and Party would have acted differently if he'd been a 5ft 4ins woman? But back to that resignation. Did you get that? He resigned. But of course political resignations aren't like real world resignations. If you quit your job that's it, finito, done, dusted, no going back. Not so in politics - here you just lay low for a while, wait for the great British public to forget what all the furore was about, then come back all shiny and new.Like Mr Pincher. Second, while many of us like a drink now and again it seems hard to get past the notion that the Tory Party seems to be in a state of constant inebriation. During Partygate we learned of the Bachanalian excess inside and outside the corridors of power - indeed the Palace of Westminster was made to sound like some Roman vomitorium. However, you slice it up the booze culture amid our political masters is as embarrassing as it is shameful. Ask yourself this - how many bars does your place of work have? Is it more or less than the eight bars our MPs have access to during their working day? I'm guessing it's less. In fact I'm guessing it's eight less. The whole sleazy matter also once again casts a long shadow over Boris Johnson's judgement. Despite Pincher's previous, and allegations of his lack of self-control, Boris rewarded his loyalty during the Partygate crisis by putting him in charge of party discipline. Couldn't make it up, could you? And as for that self-pitying mea culpa, Pincher said: "Last night I drank far too much. I've embarrassed myself and other people which is the last thing I want to do and for that I apologise to you and those concerned." "I think the right thing to do in the circumstances is for me to resign as Deputy Chief Whip." No it's not - the right thing to do it to stop getting p*ssed and groping people. Grow up, you're an absolute disgrace.
