Rita Ora, 31, showcased her incredible figure tonight at the premiere of Thor: Love and Thunder. Hot Right Now singer Rita posed for photos with Taika Waititi, 46, who wrote the film. The couple are rumoured to be engaged and tying the knot soon, and have moved back to London together in recent days. At the star-studded event, Rita stunned in a long, beaded silver gown with a plunging neckline and daring slit up the leg. The dress was almost completely sheer, some carefully placed beads protecting her modesty. Meanwhile, Taika looked dashing in a navy suit and bow tie as his love planted a kiss on his cheek.
