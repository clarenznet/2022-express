Meanwhile reservoirs were increasingly resembling dry mud beds, with a lack of any prolonged rainfall in recent weeks. Usually deep-flowing waters like Derwent Reservoir, in the Peak District; Thruscross, in Harrogate, North Yorks; Lindley Wood, in Otley, West Yorks; Threipmuir, in the Scottish Pentland Hills, and Foulridge in Colne, were low and many almost bone dry. Yorkshire Water has said usage restrictions may have to be brought in. Tim Doran, from the RNLI Water Safety Team said the service was anticipating a “busy weekend” for its crews and lifeguards. “If you are planning on going to the beach, we would encourage you to visit a lifeguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags,” he said.
