Thousands of the flying insects were spotted in Manchester city centre on Sunday afternoon. The bees covered a traffic light on the corner of King Street and Cross Street. As temperatures hit 25C, people were captured on video covering their faces with their clothes and ducking down in a bid to escape the swarm, reports Manchester Evening News. "I know Manchester is known for bees, but this was a bit extreme," tweeted Jen, who saw the bees while out and about yesterday afternoon. The bees were also seen gathering on an adjacent post box on King Street. This is not the first time swarms of the city's adopted insect have taken over the streets. In June last year, thousands of bees descended on a BMW outside an office block.  The swarm of bees covered the entire back window of the car on St James Square, near Deansgate. Crowds gathered to watch the spectacle. A bee keeper arrived at the scene, and ushered the hive into a cardboard box. And just days after, another swarm settled outside bar Albert Schloss, also in the city centre. A swarm of bees poses little danger if you know what to do, but people are advised to leave the bees alone and call their local swarm collector. You should not attempt to injure or remove the swarm yourself.  According to the British Beekeepers Association, a honeybee colony will swam to reproduce when the old queen leaves a colony with some of the bees. They leave their hive and find a spot to wait in until scout bees decide on a new home for the colony, typically between the months of May and July.
