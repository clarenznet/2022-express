Married mum Rebecca Whitehurst says she is "picking up the pieces" after a jury found her not guilty at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court.  The 46 year old was cleared of two charges of sexual activity and sending an explicit photo to a child. Rebecca, of Lymm, Cheshire, said later: "It's a huge relief. I haven't slept in God knows how long. I just want to my life back."
