Denise Austin, 65, was joined by her mini-me daughter, Katie, 29, at Saturdayâ€™s Sports Illustrated runway show during Miami Swim Week. The pair showed off their incredibly toned figures as they sported the same wavy hairstyle and similar earthy-toned bikinis. The proud mum and her daughter shared a hug as they got to the end of the runway holding hands and waving at the audience. Denise and Katie could be seen smiling broadly throughout their barefoot walk on the runway, which was held at the luxurious W South Beach.
