That forced other supermarkets to start cutting their prices, which then dragged down what other forecourts were charging. But that trigger leading to lower prices has gone now. As wholesale prices crashed during 2020 and the early lockdowns, only half of the potential saving was passed on to motorists. In the lead-up to the fuel duty cut on 23 March, wholesale petrol prices had already fallen substantially. And, since the Jubilee bank holiday, wholesale petrol has fallen 5p a litre into mid June, and then another 5p a litre since then. But, only now has the UK fuel trade as a whole started to reduce pump prices – grudgingly. There are some awesome forecourts out there, like the Texaco in Farnham that is selling it’s petrol at 186.9p a litre (which is where the average price should be). That compares with a national average of 191.3p and the supermarket up the road selling theirs at 191.9p. However, those mavericks are few and far between, even if it shows the other fuel traders that being competitive once again won’t kill them. Yet it might stop rural drivers, low-income workers and small businesses being tipped over a financial precipice. So why the wait? Could it be that some supermarkets are more intent on foisting their Aldi-matching store prices on their customers than cutting pump prices when the opportunity presents itself? Or is it the cosy relationship between supermarket and non-supermarket forecourts in towns where the pump-price postcode lottery adds another 3p or 4p to a litre? A kind of ‘if you don’t move, we don’t move on price cuts’. Or is it a carbon copy of what happened in March? Talk of a fuel duty cut suggesting to retailers that if they delay lower prices long enough the Chancellor will give them the means do it?
