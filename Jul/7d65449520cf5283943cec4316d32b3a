He made his name on Welsh radio, which encouraged him to set up a small production company in Cardiff, where he created the TV series Only Connect, presented by Victoria Coren Mitchell. Calm and softly spoken, Stuart was the only radio commentator allowed into Westminster Abbey for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.  And in 1999 he was allowed inside St George's Chapel in Windsor to commentate on the wedding of Sophie Rhys- Jones and Prince Edward. Stuart was the preferred choice of radio producers when big-name presenters went on holiday. He regularly stood in for Terry Wogan on Radio 2 and also hosted the Saturday film review show on the station. Christopher Elliot Stuart was born in Durham but his family moved to Birstall in Leicestershire. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford before joining the Western Mail in Cardiff as a feature writer. He left for a recording contract with Decca for his band, Baby Grand.  He went on to front many radio and television programmes, including Cardiff Singer Of The World for BBC Two. A huge fan of poker, he came up with the idea of filming through a clear table so viewers could see the cards when watching the Channel 4 programme Late Night Poker. He is survived by his wife Megan Emery, whom he married in 1984, along with their son and two daughters, plus a daughter from a previous marriage.  Chris Stuart, born February 19, 1949â€“ died July 13, 2022, aged 73
