Helen Skelton looked gorgeous as she sported a sleeveless floral dress with a thigh-high split which gave a glimpse of her toned legs and sun kissed skin at the summer event held on Wednesday evening. The mum-of-three enjoyed a night out on the town as she was pictured leaving the swanky Sanderson hotel in London. She accessorised her look with a pair of beige open-toe heels which elongated her firm legs giving her some extra height. The Countryfile presenter spruced up her blonde tresses by adding loose curls which were swept over her shoulder. The television host, 39, was joined at the star-studded event by Oti Mabuse, 31, Rachel Stevens, 44, Christine Lampard, 43 and Ferne McCann, 31.
