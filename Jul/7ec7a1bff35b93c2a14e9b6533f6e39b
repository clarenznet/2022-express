Kate Beckinsale, 48, stunned as she arrived at the grand opening of David Yurman's flagship store in Paris. The Hollywood actress risked a wardrobe malfunction due to her jumpsuit's plunging neckline. This left the actress' ample assets on full display, further accentuated by the standout white panel of the jumpsuit. The jumpsuit featured smart black trousers and a tight matching corset, drawing in Kate's already svelte frame. She wore her hair in a high ponytail, leaving her curls to fall effortlessly down her back. She accessorised with a silver clutch bag and diamond earrings.
