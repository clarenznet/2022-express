Paul McCartney, 80, looked in high spirits as he appeared in Liverpool, where the Beatles magic first began. Now, more than six decades after he first became the group's bassist, he showed up at a very special event awarding the latest masterminds of the British music industry. These included legendary music producer Paul Epworth, who is known for his work with Rihanna and Florence and the Machine. Paul donned a navy blue suit and pale blue shirt for his photo call at the Liverpool Institute For Performing Arts ceremony. He raised a fist jubilantly while sharing in the graduates' joy. Meanwhile, Sir Paul is maintaining his legendary reputation, having become the oldest act ever to headline at Glastonbury.
