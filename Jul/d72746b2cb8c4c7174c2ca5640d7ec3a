Vine yesterday gave evidence against Alex Belfield, formerly of BBC Radio Leeds. TV and radio host Vine told Nottingham Crown Court: "This is the Jimmy Savile of trolling.   "I have had a physical stalker who followed me. That is a picnic compared to this guy." Vine said of Belfield's YouTube channel: "Watching this man is like swimming in sewage." Belfield, of Mapperley, Notts, denies eight counts of stalking between 2012 and 2021. The case continues.
