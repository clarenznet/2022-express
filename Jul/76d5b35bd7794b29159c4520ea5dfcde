The Apprentice star Karren Brady's daughter, Sophia Peschisolido, 24, is officially engaged to partner Frankie Makin after hinting that the pair were already married late last year. The businesswoman's daughter was inundated with congratulatory messages as she flashed a huge engagement ring. Karren shared a picture of her daughter with partner Frankie Makin in view of her 134,000 Instagram followers, with Sophia showing off her huge ring to the camera as they shared a sweet kiss. Sophia wowed in a sheer peach floral gown with puff sleeves and cut-out sections around her waist as she closed her eyes to press her lips to Frankie's, wearing her sleek brunette hair up in a bun for the sun-kissed snap. The Apprentice star captioned the post: "I can't believe my little girl is engaged!!"
