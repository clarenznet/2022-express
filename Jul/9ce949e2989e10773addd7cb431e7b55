Instagram down reports have been surging in today with users saying they're having trouble with their messages inbox. Independent outage monitor Down Detector recorded a spike in Instagram down reports which began around 4pm UK time on Tuesday July 5 and has since been steadily coming in for hours. The Instagram down reports began coming in around the same time that Down Detector also registered problems with Facebook Messenger. On social media Instagram users have been talking about the problems they've been facing, saying they're having issues with trying to send messages which then disappear. On Twitter one Instagram user posted: "Are anyone elseâ€™s #instagram messages sending and then disappearing?" While another wrote: "@Instagram So why are my messages disappearing and I can't see people's messages??" One added: "@Instagram My messages keeps disappearing". And another tweeted: "My Insta messages keep on disappearing pls help @Instagram". Express.co.uk has contacted Instagram about the reported issues users are facing and asked whether a fix is in the works. At the time of writing, the official Instagram Comms Twitter account hasn't commented on the reported issues users are encountering. The latest reported issues with the popular social network come after Instagram users last week experienced issues with the photo sharing app. During that outage Instagram users had issues accessing the app's camera. With that outage Down Detector registered a steady stream of reports of Instagram down for over 24 hours. Like with the previous Instagram outage, the latest issues users are experiencing this week have come after Instagram pushed out a new update. This patch was released on Monday. Details on what the update brings to the table are thin on the ground, with the patch notes in the Apple App Store saying the update, as per usual, brings with it "bug fixes and performance improvements".
