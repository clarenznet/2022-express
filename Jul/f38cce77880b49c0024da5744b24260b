Cliff Richard, 81, arrived at Wimbledon today with a very patriotic look, as he prepares to cheer on Cameron Norrie, the last Brit left competing at Wimbledon. The singer looked dapper in the rustic Union Jack printed blazer, which featured a string of different buttons. Keeping with the colour theme, Cliff sported a blue shirt along with a coordinating tie, belt and chinos. He accessorised with a rose pinned to his blazer and round retro sunglasses. Sir Cliff's Wimbledon attire yesterday raised some eyebrows, as he donned a blue and yellow snakeskin print jacket and matching shirt. Cameron is facing six-time champion Novak Djokovic in today's Wimbledon semi-final. The 26-year-old had never made it past the third round of a Grand Slam before this year's championships.
