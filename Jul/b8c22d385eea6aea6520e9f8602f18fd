Phillip Schofield, 60, took to Instagram on Friday just hours before Holly Willoughby, 41, shared a sun-kissed selfie on social media. The ITV favourite shared a sweet snap of the pair together as he penned via his Instagram stories: "To the bestest human. Thank you for an amazing series @hollywilloughby. Happy summer break. See you in September." The mum-of three reacted to the sweet message and penned: "And you my darling... love you... see you soon handsome pants!" The presenter and entrepreneur has since shared a candid selfie as the This Morning host unveiled her glowing, tanned skin as she stripped off for a makeup-free selfie for herÂ venture Wylde Moon. The on-screen star's blonde tresses had a wet look as she closed her eyes in the sultry snap.
