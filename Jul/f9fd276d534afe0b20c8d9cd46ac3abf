As temperatures continued to soar during a protracted British heatwave, Kate Winslet commanded attention as she made her way into Evian's VIP Suite, where she was joined by a host ofÂ famous faces. Opting for a breezy blue patterned summer dress with a plunging neckline, Kate, 46, looked stunning as she greeted onlookers ahead of the day's main event. The number featured a white lace embroidered mesh overlay, alongside elbow-length peplum sleeves. She added to her seasonal look with a pair of brown suede heels and a stacked collection of jewellery, including draping necklaces of different lengths and a gold watch. While Kate's tousled hair was casually swept away from her instantly recognisable face as she posed for photos. The star was also snapped making her way into the tennis event, appearing in high spirits as she clutched onto a straw tote bag.
