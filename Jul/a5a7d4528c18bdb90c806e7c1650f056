Royal expert Richard Eden claimed that when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit royal duties and moved across the pond they "dreamed of emulating" the Obamas. Mr Eden said that like the former US president and first lady, they struck a lucrative deal with Netflix to make shows for the streaming giant. And the royal commentator claimed Harry and Meghan "appear to be attempting the second part of their transformation" following the Duke's UN speech. Writing in his weekly Palace Confidential newsletter, royal expert Mr Eden said: "When the Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit royal duties and moved to North America, they dreamed of emulating Barack and Michelle Obama and becoming major figures on the world stage. "Just like the former US president and his lawyer wife, they signed a multi-million-dollar deal to make programmes for streaming giant Netflix. "Now, Prince Harry and Meghan appear to be attempting the second part of their transformation. "This week, Harry gave what he hoped would be a landmark speech at the United Nations to mark Nelson Mandela International Day. "His address encompassed everything from climate change to the pandemic and, inevitably, included his usual digs at the media."
