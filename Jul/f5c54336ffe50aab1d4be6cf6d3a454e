The 30-year-old man, who was a boat captain, had attempted to tie his vessel to a rock on the island of Nimos but slipped and fell to his death, it is understood. The impact of hitting the rock knocked the tourist unconscious before he was dragged out of the sea by his three passengers. Although a rescue boat was dispatched after the passengers alerted the local coastguard, the man later died at a medical centre. Coastguards returned to the Captain Denise to help bring the boat and its remaining passengers to port in Symi, where the boat is now anchored, Mirror reports. The tragedy happened at around midday on Tuesday. The Briton's body has since been transferred to the island of Rhodes so that an autopsy can be carried out. The remaining three passengers were not injured during the incident and Symi port authorities have launched a routine investigation into the death. On Wednesday, another holidaymaker in Greece miraculously survived 18 hours adrift at sea by clinging to a small ball. The ball was lost at sea by young boys on a beach an amazing 80 miles away. The tourist named as Ivan, 30, was swept out to sea by powerful currents off the coast of Kassandra in Greece. Desperate friends watched helplessly from the beach and raised the alarm with the Greek coastguard but Ivan was declared lost at sea. In a bizarre twist of fate, he was saved when a child's ball floated toward him and he used it as a buoyancy aid. Ivan was rescued from the water on July 10 after 18 hours adrift, still clutching onto the ball.
