Novak Djokovic was in imperious form at Wimbledon on Friday afternoon as he bullied fellow Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic in their third round clash on Centre Court on his way to a 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 victory.  Djokovic was streets ahead of Kecmanovic as he moved his compatriot around the court, produced an array of mesmerising shots and kept his concentration to the end. And the 35-year-old, who has won the last three Wimbledon titles and six in total, ultimately had too much for his opponent as he made light work of the match and cruised into the fourth round. “Honestly I think I’ve been playing better and better as the tournament progresses so that’s obviously something you always wish for as a player - that every match that you play you raise a level of tennis up a notch,” Djokovic said after the match. “I think that’s what’s happening at the moment. I know I can always do better - I always expect the highest of myself. But so far so good and I’m looking forward to the next challenge.” Djokovic will take on Tim van Rijthoven in the fourth round as he goes in search of a 21st Grand Slam title. And Van Rijthoven has insisted he isn’t scared of facing the top seed. “Yeah, I go into every match thinking I can win the match,” the Dutchman stated. “Also against Djokovic I'll go into that match thinking I can win that match, yeah.” Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
