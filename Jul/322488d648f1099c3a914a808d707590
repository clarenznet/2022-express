Simon Gibson who died aged 94 in May last year, led a relatively modest lifestyle, driving a battered yellow VW Beetle and buying second class train ­tickets instead of first class. He also preferred cruising holidays around the Scottish lochs instead of flying off to millionaire playgrounds in the Caribbean.  Friends said he preferred to donate many millions of pounds to charities, schools, churches, local sports teams and hospitals, earning a CBE for his philanthropy. His generosity was reflected in his will which left most of his net estate of £103,857,487 to his charity, the Simon Gibson Charitable Trust which he set up in 1975 to help national and local charities in South Wales, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. Simon, who never married and had no children, also left gifts to relatives and £30,000 each to all the workers on his estate near Exning near Newmarket, Suffolk. The same sum was left to all ­former employees who had retired from the Exning Estate Company after reaching pensionable age during his lifetime, and to staff at his home Landwade Hall. His latest devoted carer, South African-born Shelagh Foster was left £75,000 along with his cottage and its contents in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and her choice of one of his cars.  Colin McCarty, who knew Simon for nearly 40 years, said: “He had a new Rolls Royce, but I never saw him drive it. “He was famed for driving around in his clapped out yellow Beetle. He was a farmer and a good businessman who enjoyed helping worthy causes. People came and asked him for help, and very ­seldom were they turned away. Simon’s solicitor Barry Taylor said: “He was a really generous man during his lifetime and as we can see from his will, that has continued in his legacies. “He was a quiet, humble man who was good through and through. A true gentleman of the old school.”
