Hospital numbers are also steadily rising, with early indications of more intensive care admissions among older age groups. An estimated 2.3 million people in private households had the virus last week, up 32 per cent from a week earlier, said the Office for National Statistics. This is the highest estimate for total infections in Britain since late April – but way below the record high of 4.9 million seen at the peak of the Omicron BA.2 wave at the end of March. Covid remains most prevalent in Scotland, where one in 18 were estimated to be testing positive last week. This grew from one in 20 the week prior and is Scotland’s highest figure since early April.  In England, around one in 30 were thought to have had it, up from one in 40 the previous week – while Wales saw infections jump from one in 45 over the seven days to one in 30. In Northern Ireland, there was a slightly less severe spike to an estimated one in 25, growing from one in 30.
