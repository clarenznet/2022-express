The apparent lack of progress comes after the testing unit was described by RAF boss Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston as aiming to deliver the service's "futuristic and ambitious" plans to harness drone swarms. The updates were revealed following Freedom of Information requests by Drone Wars UK, a campaign group calling for greater public accountability over military usage of the flying machines. Director Chris Cole said: "Defence companies often over-promise and politicians can be dazzled by new military technologies, so it's crucial that there is proper transparency around these programmes." The RAF said 216 Squadron had invited the drone industry to stage demonstrations of "swarming" miniature flying vehicles. These are similar to the craft used for the airborne light display in the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace last month. They combined in formation to depict a crown, a cup of tea and a corgi. It is understood RAF personnel have viewed demonstrations of five types of drone in the past year. RAF sources said 216 Squadron has observed 13 trials carried out by manufacturers since its formation in 2020. Last year an exercise saw 20 of the pilotless craft fly in a swarm at RAF Spadeadam, an electronic warfare training range in Cumbria.
