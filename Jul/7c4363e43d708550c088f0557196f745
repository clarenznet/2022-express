While the majority of the UK is currently experiencing unprecedented temperatures, the people of Cornwall have been subjected to a very different type of weather. This morning at around 7am, dark clouds could be seen rolling in from the coast at Penzance. Lightning could be seen from the town at a distance, as the cloud's approached, reports Cornwall Live. While the town itself was not struck, Long Rock - between Marazion and Penzance - was. Zak Harries, who works at Chris Sedgeman scaffolding yard, witnessed a sight that was both jaw-dropping and terrifying. At around 6.52am, Mr Harries was filming the turbulent weather when lightning suddenly cracked from the sky towards the ground. His video shows the fork of lightning striking some distant scaffolding. Shouts - and a lot of swearing in shock - could be heard. The video further shows several of Mr Harries' co-workers ducking away from the lightning. Mr Harries said there had been thunder and lightning for around 45 minutes prior to the amazing clip which he shared. "I was trying to catch the storm and luckily got the strike that hit closest," he said. People flooded to Cornwall Live's Facebook page to discuss the phenomenal sight. One person commented:  "I would say this is far more dangerous than the heat." Another person wrote: "Those lads were lucky!!" A third person added: "That made me jump ... isn't Mother Nature just awesome". Penzance and the surrounding area were hit by the storms first, but elsewhere in the county, similar sights are predicted. At some point between 9am and midday today, most areas of Cornwall were expected to get a bout of rain and even some lightning. Elsewhere across the country temperatures are sky-rocketing to record-breaking levels, with parts of the UK hitting 40 degrees.
