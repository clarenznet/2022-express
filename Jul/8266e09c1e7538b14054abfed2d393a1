No trains were running into or out of London King's Cross and no Thameslink or Great Northern services were expected to serve north of London all day. East Midlands Railway ran limited services between Derby, Nottingham, Luton, Bedford and London, and stopped completely between lunchtime and 7pm - the hottest part of the day. There were limited services running into and out of London Euston and London Marylebone, Network Rail said. All trains were halted at Birmingham New Street station after a power line fault that led to two explosions. One passenger said: "People thought we had crashed. We saw the overhead lines fall off on to the track. The train just carried on and then it happened again and the cables fell down again." Speed restrictions were put in place after the hottest railway track reached 143.6F (62C) on Monday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted it will take decades to upgrade existing lines to be more resilient to climate change.  He conceded that the Victorian-era infrastructure "just wasn't built to withstand this type of temperature." He added: "Where those tracks are 40C [104F] in the air, on the ground that could be 50, 60, 70 and more, so you get a severe danger of tracks buckling. What we can't have is trains running over those and a terrible derailing." Meanwhile, road congestion was down on last week as people avoided travelling in the heat. RAC Breakdown spokesman Rod Dennis said: "This suggests drivers are heeding the warnings and only setting out if they're confident their vehicles won't fail them."
