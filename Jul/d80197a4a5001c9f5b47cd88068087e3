I had actually lost a little time at Turn One anyway – so it was effectively a double penalty. "Still, we did not have the pace today to get through into the next part of qualifying – but there are plenty of opportunities in tomorrow's Sprint Race and we will hopefully start in a better position for Sunday's Grand Prix.” Aston Martin has struggled for pace this season as the team drop away from the midfield. Vettel has scored just 15 points this season in a miserable year for the multiple champion. However, Vettel has still managed to outscore his team-mate Stroll who has picked up just three points to his name this season. It is a critical time for Vettel who has claimed he will decide his future in the sport this summer. He admitted his performances over this part of the season would play a part in his decision to either sign a deal or quit. The 35-year-old admitted there were elements of the sport he longer enjoyed.

The summer is the usual time when you start to talk so we will see.”
