Lilia Valutyte was found at the scene in Fountain Lane, Boston, Lincolnshire, at about 6.20pm yesterday, according to Lincolnshire Police. The force said today two people have been arrested as part of a murder investigation following what they described as an "isolated incident". Chief Superintendent Kate Anderson said: "Our thoughts continue to be with Lilia's family and friends." The senior officer described Lilia's death as an "utter tragedy". Lilia's parents have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers. The leader of Boston Borough Council, Paul Skinner, said the town was united in mourning following the "very sad and tragic death".  He said: "We can't for one second imagine the pain the family and the young girl's friends are going through and our heartfelt condolences go out to them. "I would like to thank the emergency services for their swift response and I would encourage anyone with any information to make contact with the police on 101. "I understand this incident has left many people shocked and worried." He added that as a sign of respect to Lilia's family, the council would fly a flag from the Municipal Buildings at half-mast.  At the scene late on Thursday night, a police car was stationed on either side of an alleyway to cordon the area off to the public. Two forensic officers in white suits could be seen working at the scene before leaving in the early hours of this morning. Matt Warman, the Conservative MP for Boston and Skegness, said he had been in contact with the policing minister to ensure national assistance is available to the murder investigation.  Mr Warman said in a statement posted on Twitter: "Profoundly shocking news in Boston this evening. I have spoken to senior officers locally and am hugely grateful for all the emergency services' work. "I have also been in contact with Policing Minister Tom Pursglove to ensure that any national help that might be useful is made available as quickly as possible."
