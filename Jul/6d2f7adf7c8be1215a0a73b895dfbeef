Coverage will be restricted to the judge handing down a sentence and explaining the reasons for it, with a time delay to avoid broadcasting any violent or abusive reaction. The first televised sentencing, which will make history, will take place at the Old Bailey on Thursday, featuring the case of 25-year-old Ben Oliver, who admitted manslaughter after stabbing his elderly grandfather to death.  Viewers will get to see inside the courtroom for around 30 minutes, but the cameras will be fixed firmly on the judge with no view of the defendant, victims, jurors, lawyers, or witnesses. The time delay is to avoid reactions such as gangster Kenny Noye, who was convicted of handling some of the stolen £26m Brinks Mat gold bullion, and told his jury: “I hope you all die of cancer”.
