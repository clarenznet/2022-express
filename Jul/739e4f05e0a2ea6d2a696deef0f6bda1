Sharon Osbourne, 69, looked radiant while out and about in West Hollywood after wanting to reverse her face lift. The former The Talk co-host said the procedure was “horrendous” and her husband, Black Sabbath star Ozzy Osbourne, agreed. Recounting her conversation with Ozzy about the corrective surgery, Sharon told The Sunday Times: “He said, ‘I don’t care how much it costs, we’ll get it redone.’” In new makeup-free pictures, Sharon looked ageless as she embraced her natural beauty while smiling for photographers in an all-black outfit.
