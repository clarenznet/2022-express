The Princess was earlier spotted arriving in a Royal helicopter. She made an appearance at at a garden party at Hillsborough Castle and Gardens this afternoon, and could be seen greeting guests with Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. It is the first annual garden party held at the castle since the beginning of the Covid pandemic. The party was held to honour community workers. Anne also visited Ballymena in Co Antrim, and an equine rehabilitation centre as part of her one-day trip to Northern Ireland. The visit began with a trip to Ballymena Showgrounds. A flagship celebration is being held there to mark 100 years of cadets from across Northern Ireland in St John's Ambulance. Anne met with leaders, as well as cadets and badgers, learning more about the organisation’s range of youth programmes and activities. The Royal Family tweeted: "Celebrating 100 years of St John's Ambulance Cadets!  "Since 1922, the Cadets has enabled young people to learn vital first aid skills, as well as building confidence." The Princess also met with several young people completing the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. She later visited the Irish Equine Rehabilitation Centre in Lower Ballinderry in Co Antrim. Here she viewed the stable area, and saw a demonstration of a water treadmill and saltwater hydrotherapy used in the rehabilitation of horses. The party at Hillsborough Castle represents her last of the day, where she appeared as a maid of honour.  The organisation, BAPRAS (British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons) aims to raise awareness of the breadth of plastic surgery as well as promote innovation in the field and understanding of the profession.
