This is a significant drop from the average of 140 in 2014, the year before a 5p charge was brought in to curb the use of plastic. Experts said the higher 10p fee introduced last year had helped to “turn the tide” on plastic waste. Environment Minister Steve Double said: “Our plastic bag charge has ended the sale of billions of single-use bags, protecting our landscapes and ensuring millions of pounds are redistributed to worthy causes.  “There is much more to do to tackle the problem of plastic waste.” The number of single-use carrier bags sold by the main supermarkets stood at 197 million in 2021/22, down from 271 million in 2019/2020 – a drop of 27 per cent. This compared to 7.6 billion used in 2014 before the charge was introduced. Mr Double said: “That is why we are building on our single-use plastic bans and introducing the deposit return scheme for bottles, to fight back against littering and drive up recycling rates.”  The Daily Express’s Green Britain Needs You crusade is supporting calls for customers to be offered compostable or sustainable paper carriers which help protectthe environment. Adam Herriott, of food waste charity Wrap, said: “Flexibles remain one of the most common plastics in our bins but, just like pots, tubs and trays, we’re now at a point where the tide is turning on flexible plastics.”
