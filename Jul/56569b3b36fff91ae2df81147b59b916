 The Twitter user @gotbighoop shared a text that they had apparently received from Santander. The Text said: “Santander support - A new standing order of £793.22 to Kwick Fit has been set up. If this was NOT, you please report at app-request-logon.com” In their tweet, the user said that they did not even own a vehicle and attached a screenshot of the text message. The tweet said: “I didn’t tap on the link. A scam?”     The screenshot showed that the message had come from a mobile number and also included a link which was clearly not an official link to a Santander site. Santander responded confirming that this was indeed a scam attempt. The bank confirmed that it would “never include a link in any communication”. It then asked the Twitter user to forward the message to Santander’s fraud team.

This style of text scam is currently making the rounds as another user also reported a message to the bank on Twitter. User @User_lowton tweeted a similar-looking screenshot of a message from a mobile number claiming to be from Santander’s online help desk. This message claimed that a new direct debit had been set up with a motor company.    The message said: “Santander Online Help Desk - A new direct debit of £893.21 to Suns Motors has been set up. If this was NOT, you please report at: requested-app-logon.com”. The Twitter user had tried to report first to Santander’s phone support however was told by an automated message that there “was a very long wait”. He said: “Not impressed with the lack of help trying to report an (almost certain) scam message. Online help is a phone number and telephone help is a warning that it is a very long wait.” The bank’s Twitter support team first apologised to @User_Lowton and confirmed that this was a scam message.

They then said that @User_Lowton should ignore and delete the message. On Santander’s website, it states that “there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to protecting yourself from fraudulent activity”. The bank has however put together a list of things that can help people spot and avoid fraud and scams.     Some of the tips include thinking carefully before making a payment and speaking to someone a person trusts before making any payments. It also reiterates that “anyone can be easily impersonated” and criminals can make the caller ID, email address or name look like a genuine caller. So, if a person receives an email, text or call, verify it’s genuine by phoning them back on a known and trusted number. It also stated that banks, the police, or any trusted organisation “will never ask you to withdraw, transfer or send back money from your account. If you’re asked to do this, it’s a scam.”
