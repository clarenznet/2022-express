No other Prime Minister has had to cope with all that Boris Johnson has been through for us, with sections of the media and his own party members stabbing him in the back from the moment he secured Brexit for us. Shame on them all. I don’t think they were doing it for their constituents. Thank you, Mr Johnson. Without you so many more people would have died from Covid, for sure. Not many countries furloughed companies to the same extent and many employees took the cash and worked. I imagine your columnist Frederick Forsyth is clapping his hands now. Shirley Whitaker, Swindon, Wilts -------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Daily Express, for that glowing tribute I would like to thank Daily Express editor Gary Jones for last Friday’s fantastic front page and the leader tribute to this unique man who restored our nation’s freedom from the EU (“A maverick who gave his nation freedom and hope”, July 8). John Potter, Corsham, Wilts -------------------------------------------------- Sly backstabbers will get what’s coming to them Bravo Boris for what you achieved in office. It was never easy and you coped magnificently with all that was thrown at you. I hope whoever succeeds you can do as well and I hope that all the backstabbers get their comeuppance. Annette Hale, Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset -------------------------------------------------- I’ll never vote again after hero was thrown to dogs Thank you Boris Johnson for all you have achieved. After this treachery, I will never vote again. God help the country now. Barbara Marshall, Helmdon, Northants
