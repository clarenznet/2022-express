Jake Paul has fired back at Conor McGregor's recent comment that the YouTube star is a “nobody” and a “flop”. McGregor was responding to Paul’s claims that a fight between the pair would make them $100m [£84m] each. Talking up the fight during a recent appearance on The MMA Hour, Paul told host Ariel Helwani: "I think for me, fighting a couple more times, continuing to knock some people out, and he [McGregor] has to get active again, who knows when that's gonna happen? I think those two things need to happen, and then at some point, it's gotta happen. He continued: "You know, why not? He's a businessman, I'm a businessman, and that's $75 to $100 million [£63m-£84.3m] for both of us." McGregor was quick to respond as he ripped into Paul, tweeting: "You’ve [had] 2 fights and done 70k buys." "You are a flop, kid. A nobody,” McGregor followed up. Now, ‘The Problem Child’ has returned fire via a profanity-filled video with plenty of unsavoury claims. “These are his tweets, and here’s my response,” said Paul while voicing over a screenshot of McGregor’s tweets. “Conor, Conor, Conor. You’re more active on Twitter than you are in the Octagon. Stop taking Trenbolone and start taking fights. You’re more actively cheating on your wife than you are in the Octagon. Your priorities are mixed up. Put down the bottle and get back to fighting. You haven’t won a fight in five f***ing years and the last time you did was against Cowboy [Donald] Cerrone who hasn’t won a fight against anyone since fighting you. “’I’m a nobody’ you say in this tweet -- well yeah, you’re right -- I’m just a kid from Ohio. I really am a nobody, but this is where you fought your sixth fight,” said Paul as a picture of McGregor’s fight against Joe Duffy in Cork flashed up on the screen. MORE BOXING NEWS...

And this is where I’m going to be fighting my sixth fight, Madison Square Garden, the Mecca of boxing. August 6th. I know you’ll be watching kiddo. Here’s another fun fact, in your eighteenth fight you made $150,000 [£126,000], in my fifth fight I made $15 million [£12.6m]. You want to talk about pay-per-view buys? “Nate Robinson, 1.8 million, Ben Askren, 500,000, Tyron Woodley one, 500,000, Tyron Woodley two, no one even wanted to see that fight and we got 200,000 pay-per-view buys. In the last five years you’ve had zero pay-per-view buys because you don’t f***ing fight. You have a lot to say about me but I’m sharing millions of dollars with underpaid fighters while you’re sharing hookers with Dana White.” Paul continued: “Last year when I won knockout of the year you were just getting knocked out. Fix your calcium deficiency, stop breaking your bones and let’s get in the f***ing ring and make $200 million [£168m].”
