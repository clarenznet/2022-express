If you fancy some wine for the weekend, there’s also reductions on white wine and cases of red wine. Here are the best current offers on alcohol on Amazon. The most popular bottle on sale is the Absolut Voices Limited Edition Swedish Vodka which has over 4,000 reviews. The number one bestseller in plain vodka, some 88 percent of reviewers have given it a five star rating. Steve Bison wrote: “This is top quality vodka. 40 percent as opposed to the usual 37 percent so nice and strong. I love drinking this ice cold and neat with either a slice of lemon peel or a splash of a good orange liqueur.” Only running for a short period, shop the booze sale here.
