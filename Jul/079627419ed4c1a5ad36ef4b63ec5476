Max Verstappen managed to grab pole position by pipping Charles Leclerc at the end of Friday's eventful qualifying session at the Red Bull Ring in Austria. The Dutchman went quickest with his final lap of the day and will line up at the very front of the grid for Saturday's sprint as a result of his strong showing. Verstappen will be closely followed off the line by Leclerc, who came up just short in spite of his best efforts in Q3 but still managed to finish ahead of his Ferrari team-mate Carlos Sainz, who was only good enough for third place. Sergio Perez, meanwhile, was able to get himself up into fourth with a decent lap and will be aiming to trouble the drivers ahead of him over the course of this weekend's sprint event. It was a disastrous qualifying session for Mercedes, though, with Lewis Hamilton and George Russell both crashing out in the final minutes of Q3. The former lost control at Turn Five and was unable to prevent his car from skidding into the barriers before the latter spun out at the last corner, leaving the Silver Arrows with plenty of work to do overnight in order to fix both cars in advance of Saturday's on-track action.
