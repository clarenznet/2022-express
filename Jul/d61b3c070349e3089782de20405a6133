Kremlin loyalist Vladimir Solovyov has backed Donald Trump to beat President Biden in a race for the White House and described the billionaire as "the most adequate politician in today's world." Solovyov went as far as to suggest Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine would not have gone ahead under a Donald Trump-led administration in the United States. Solovyov told Russia1: "It's all so surprising to see, I liked it a lot when the White House said 'We have no opportunity to talk. "'We don't understand why we get no opportunity to talk "'Throw us a pass so that we'll want to talk to you' "And we say 'We don't want to, maybe you want to talk, but we don't'" JUST IN: Putin under 'pressure' as 'poor health' forces him to accelerate war "But Blinken says steps must be taken," continued the Putin propagandist. "We don't want to take any steps towards you, we will wait for Trump. "Trump recently scared everyone, he hit them hard. "He said 'That's it, I'm coming back in the fall of 2022, or maybe sooner- get ready!'" "Of course, Trump is a beaut," added Solovyov. "I also have to say I am deeply convinced that if Trump was around there wouldn't be a February 24th. "Trump would not have behaved as brazenly and disrespectfully as Biden and his team during the December negotiations. "No Biden is fundamentally different to Trump, Trump even said 'I don't need NATO.' He continued: "Trump hates Ukraine because Ukraine was doing everything possible for Trump not to get elected." The Russian state TV host went on to exclaim: "Trump, Trump, Trump!" Since the February 24 invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a big chunk of territory across Ukraine's southern flank above Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Russia is slowly pushing Ukrainian forces out of two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine which it has recognised as independent states.
