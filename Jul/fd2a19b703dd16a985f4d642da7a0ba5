If you own a PS4 or PS5 and are looking to invest in some new games, then now is the time to visit the PlayStation Store. Sony has just launched the PlayStation Summer Sale, which sees hundreds of games and DLC packs discounted to their lowest ever price. This includes blockbuster new releases such as Uncharted Legacy of Thieves The Quarry and LEGO Skywalker Saga, as well as modern classics like Red Dead 2, Batman Arkham Collection and Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy. According to Sony, the sale will run all the way until August 17, with additional titles joining the promotion on August 3. Sony explains more: "The Summer Sale promotion comes to PlayStation Store on July 20. For a limited time, enjoy the very best of PlayStation Store for less, as games – from blockbusters to indies – add-ons and more are discounted." If you've got a PlayStation Wishlist, then it's worth checking it out to see if any of your favourite games have joined the sale. Highlights include WWE 2K22 for £32.99, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order for £8.99, Red Dead 2 for £21.99, and fellow Rockstar title GTA 5 for £12.59. The superb It Takes Two is down to £17.49, while one of my personal favourite games Sifu is just £26.39. That's on top of Tales of Arise for £24.99, Mafia Trilogy for £19.99, Borderlands 3 for £11.99, and Devil May Cry 5 for just £8.24. It is however, worth pointing out that not all games are playable on both PS4 and PS5, so you might need to filter by platform to ensure you get the right discount for the correct version.
