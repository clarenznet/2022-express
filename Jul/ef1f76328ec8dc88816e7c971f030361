Rebekah Vardy, 40, seemed to have been putting some of the pressures of the trial behind her after being accused of leaking personal information about her WAG rival from her Instagram account to the press. She had turned up to court alone on the final day of the trial while Coleen and her footballer husband Wayne Rooney jetted off on holiday - only to storm out just 30 minutes into the hearing after being accused of "lying under oath". Now that court appearances have concluded, Rebekah has been getting back to life as usual, which includes posting on the app where all the drama began. Yesterday the mother-of-five posted a photo of herself with daughter Olivia practising yoga poses. The 40-year-old confidently flaunted her flawless physique in a black bikini while encouraging her child to emulate her supple stretches. "Rooted baby girl with big sister giving a helping hand," she captioned the photo in view of her 409,000 followers.
