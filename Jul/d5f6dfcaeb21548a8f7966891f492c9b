In our letter, we outlined how much of an honour it had been to serve our country as Ministers of the Crown and have a chance to serve the public working on Levelling Up, improving skills, new digital and tech, and supporting British business. But it had, regretfully, become clear that the Government could not go on as it was. We all came into Parliament at the same time in 2017 and together we have witnessed some of the most electric years in British politics since the war. Now Putin’s brutality is ravaging our economy and damaging the British people’s quality of life. In the coming Conservative Party leadership election, we need to find someone who can move us on from recent distractions, who has the courage to tell things as they are, and who can provide solutions which work. That’s why we are backing Kemi Badenoch. Since we were first elected, we have seen her develop into a highly accomplished and experienced politician. She has served with distinction in three great departments – Treasury, Education, and Levelling Up, Housing and Communities – and as a Vice Chair of the Party. She understands how we can improve government and party politics, how to stand up to established orthodoxies, and get things done. One of the few trained engineers in the House of Commons, her root-cause approach runs through everything she does. Kemi is the embodiment of how the promise of our country can be fulfilled.
