The sets are spectacular and have been augmented by sophisticated video stylings and special effects. The choreography has been ramped up and the grand set piece - Be Our Guest - has razzle-dazzle to the max in a fusion of a Las Vegas revue and Busby Berkeley extravaganza. Courtney Stapleton plays Belle as a feisty geek and her vocal range is impressive though she tends towards harshness at full volume. If Shaq Taylor's Beast resembles a biker werewolf with horns, he is more petulant pussycat than untamed creature, though he invests plenty of emotional power in his big number If I Can't Love Her. Beauty and the Beast, London Palladium until September 17 (UK tour until January 8), tickets: 020 7492 0834, disneytickets.co.uk
