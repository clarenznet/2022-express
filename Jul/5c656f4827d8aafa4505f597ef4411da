Apex Legends developer Respawn is getting ready to introduce the Gaiden event. The latest Apex Legends event has a July 19 release date and a 6pm BST UK launch time. Running for two weeks, Apex Legends Gaiden will be split into two parts, at least in terms of challenges and rewards. Fans will also be able to play the Armed and Dangerous limited-time mode, which mixes up the rules of play. Armed and Dangerous limits weaponry to snipers and shotguns, essentially eliminating traditional mid-range combat. "Rack your shotguns and wipe down your scopes because Armed and Dangerous is back, where weapons are limited to snipers and shotguns, and loot overall is much harder to come by. "Armed and Dangerous will be available from July 19th to August 2nd with World’s Edge, Olympus, and Storm Point as the map rotation." But the real highlight of the Gaiden event is the ability to unlock upwards of 40 rewards by completing weekly challenge tracks. "Summon your inner hero with 40 adventurous event-limited cosmetics, including new Legendary skins for Revenant, Mirage, Octane and Wattson with complementary skins for the Flatline, Wingman, EVA-8 and Charge Rifle." You can see a selection of the rewards below. And check back later for Apex Legends patch notes.
