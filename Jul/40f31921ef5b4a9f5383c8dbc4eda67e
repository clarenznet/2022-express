Her partially clothed body was found in the early hours of Sunday. CCTV footage showed her being pulled into a driveway and attacked, the court heard. Jordan McSweeney, 29, is accused of murdering the 35-year-old as she walked home in Ilford, east London. Paramedics tried to save her but she died in hospital shortly after being attacked. McSweeney, of Dagenham, east London, is also accused of trying to rape her and of stealing her phone, keys and handbag. Appearing via video link from HM Prison Thameside wearing a green jumper, he spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth during the 20-minute hearing. He did not enter a plea. Oliver Glasgow QC, prosecuting, told the court: "The defendant has been charged in connection with the death of Zara Aleena, which took place in the early hours of Sunday." He added: "Emergency services were called after her body was discovered. She was bleeding, struggling to breathe, had sustained serious head injuries and was partially naked. "Paramedics attended and tried to give her life-saving first aid, but her injuries were so severe they could not save her." Mr Glasgow continued: "A man can be seen to set about her, drag her to the driveway in Cranbrook Road, forcing her to the ground, and can then be seen stamping repeatedly on her body." McSweeney was remanded in custody by Recorder of London Judge Mark Lucraft QC.  Rhiannon Cole, McSweeney's lawyer, did not make any bail application. The judge did not address McSweeney at any point. The suspect will next appear at the same court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on September 30.A trial is expected to begin early next year but a date was not given yesterday. Ms Aleena's family described in a powerful tribute to her this week how she believed that every woman should be able to walk home at night.
