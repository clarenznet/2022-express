The Lightning Seeds, comedian David Baddiel and footballer cum singer-songwriter Chelcee Grimes will belt out the footie favourite at a special gig staged by The National Lottery. Baddiel’s former sidekick Frank Skinner can’t make the concert, but he says he’ll be singing along from the sidelines. Lioness legends, Fara Williams, Rachel Yankey and Faye White, who share over 390 caps between them for England from the past, will also join the chorus. Three Lions was originally written as the England's anthem for UEFA Euro 1996, and Skinner and Baddiel co-wrote and performed the song alongside The Lightning Seeds. A re-recording had a roaring comeback when England got to the semi finals in the 2018 World Cup, and the original later became the first song in UK history to have four spells at No 1. Earlier this year there were reports it might be banned as ‘too offensive’ for the Qatar World Cup. This afternoon’s performance will take place at the end of a set by the Lightning Seeds at Camden’s iconic Electric Ballroom in London. Baddiel said: “It’s a great honour that Football’s Coming Home remains such a fan favourite twenty-five years on. It feels fitting that we reflect the amazing achievements of the Lionesses with a unique performance of the anthem at this very special National Lottery gig. Skinner added: “The Lionesses are playing some of the most exciting football I’ve ever seen from an England team. I’m gutted not to be there.” Tickets for today’s gig, priced at £5,  went on sale yesterday and National Lottery players are being offered two tickets for the price of one as a thank you for their support. Over £50 million of lottery funding has been invested into football in ways that directly benefit the women’s and girls’ games- including support for current England squad members Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott and Ellen White.
