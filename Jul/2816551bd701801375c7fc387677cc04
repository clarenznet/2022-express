Fans of Christopher Nolan have been patiently awaiting their first look at the filmmaker's next project. Oppenheimer was announced last year as Nolan's new movie, a picture that will look into the life of the titular real-life person: Robert Oppenheimer. The first trailer has now been released, and can be watched by scrolling down or at the top of this article. Oppenheimer is due to hit cinemas in 2023, and the newly-released trailer has revealed its release date. Nolan's new biopic will be released on July 21, 2023. Starring Murphy, of Peaky Blinder's fame, the movie will tell "the story of American scientist J Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb". The film will "thrust audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it". Murphy is joined by a slate of A-listers from Hollywood, including Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr, who is playing Lewis Strauss. A number of other stars are in Nolan's new epic, including Florence Pugh, Jack Quaid, Matthew Modine, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett and Gary Oldman. In history, Oppenheimer, along with a team of other scientists, invented the atomic bomb in 1945, during World War II. These A-bombs were later dropped in Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The use of these bombs killed between 129,000 and 226,000 Japanese people. Nolan is best known for releasing a trilogy of Batman films, as well as mind-bending movies such as Memento, Inception, and Tenet. He also recently delved into historical fiction - much like he will in Oppenheimer - in 2017's Dunkirk. Oppenheimer hits cinemas on July 21, 2023.
