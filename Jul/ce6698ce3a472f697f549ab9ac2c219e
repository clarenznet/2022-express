Jane Fonda, now 84, was married to Roger Vadim at the time that she channelled science fiction heroine Barbarella in the movie of the same name. However, despite initially being "sexually awakened" by her beau, she became increasingly dissatisfied with how the movie, with Roger at its helm, portrayed her. She was critical of the focus on her astronaut character "having strange sexual adventures", feeling it detracted from what could have been an empowering and all-encompassing female role. Despite looking sensational in a series of outfits including a metallic bikini, thigh high boots and a bright green fringed bodysuit, all while brandishing a ray gun, she later told Glamour magazine it was "objectifying". She added that after that film, she opted to leave her husband and "become a feminist".
