Adam Woodyatt was spotted having a blast on Saturday as the former EastEnders star was selling vegan food at the CarFest North festival held  in Cheshire. The actor was worlds away from his Ian Beale days as he handed out food to hungry customers. The star was dressed in a branded green T-shirt and a wide brimmed camo hat. Adam was helping to run a plant-based street food trailer with catering company Kilty & Co. The soap actor was the longest-serving member of the cast of EastEnders when he quit the role in November 2020. He has hinted that he has quit for good, telling Steph McGovern earlier this year: “I’ve kind of left, but not left. It’s kind of the way the storyline has gone, I’m not there. “There are no plans at the moment.”
