Jamie Redknapp's wife Frida sparked a frenzy after sharing an incredible bikini snap of herself relaxing poolside. The mother-of-five soaked up the sun while perching in the shallow end of a pool in a bid to top up her already flawless tan. Frida dazzled in a tiny red bikini which put her toned abs on display, just eight months after welcoming hers and Jamie's adorable son, Raphael. In the next snap, Frida smiled as she snuggled up to the tot, enjoying their holiday away with Jamie and his two sons with ex-wife Louise Redknapp, Charley and Beau. Earlier in the week, Jamie shared an adorable pic with his three sons in the pool. The former footballer was all smiles as he sat on his son Beau's shoulders while little Raphael stood on Charley's as Jamie held his hand.
