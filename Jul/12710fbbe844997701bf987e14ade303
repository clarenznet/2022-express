The next episode to air, which is understood to be on Thursday July 21 at 8pm, will see Monty return to Longmeadow. A synopsis for the episode says: “Monty is back at Longmeadow, getting stuck into some seasonal jobs. “Arit Anderson and Nick Bailey present highlights from RHS Flower Show Tatton Park in Cheshire. They share the latest design advice from the show gardens and the must-have plants of the season from the flower-filled floral marquee. “Also, Carol Klein salutes the floral glories of high summer when she visits a garden in Somerset, and we meet another tree champion as we continue our celebration of the Queen’s Green Canopy.”
