His car only had a small 1,071cc engine and was up against much bigger and stronger opposition, cars which were, on paper, four times more powerful.Â His success inspired film-makers to feature Mini Coopers in the classic 1969 film The Italian Job, where they slalomed through the winding streets of Turin in dramatic chases. Belfast-born Hopkirk started driving aged nine and later studied engineering at Trinity College, Dublin. He became a professional rally driver before completing his degree. After winning the Circuit of Ireland, he moved on to Sunbeam Rapiers and found success with navigator Jack Scott. He drove a Rapier in the 1962 Monte Carlo rally and finished third. Then Pat Moss, sister of Stirling Moss, won a rally driving a Mini Cooper in 1962, and people in the sport started noticing how well it performed. Hopkirk and Scott switched and found they were on a winner. Hopkirk found the front-wheel drive effective in the Monte Carlo rally of 1964 when negotiating icy mountain roads. After the win, The Beatles sent him a telegram which read: "It's nice to be No.1 isn't it?" In 1968 he took part in the Daily Express London-Sydney rally in a BMC 1800. He retired from racing in 1970 and set up a car accessories company in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and also became president of the Historic Rally Car Register. In 1967 Hopkirk married Jennifer Manser, who survives him along with their children, Patrick, William and Katie.
