EE is running a brilliant deal on the iPhone 13 which is ideal if you regularly run out of data. The limited time offer is on the 40GB plan for the iPhone 13, which costs £57 a month with a £50 upfront payment. 40GB doesn't sound much but luckily EE is boosting this to 100GB thanks to the addition of 60GB of 5G data entirely for free. And this isn't the only freebie included with the plan. EE also offers six months of free access to Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade with this iPhone 13 plan. These subscriptions will offer you access to over 90million songs with Apple Music, hit boxsets like Ted Lasso and the Oscar winning Coda with Apple TV+, and hundreds of hit games with Apple Arcade. If you want to take advantage of this money-saving offer you need to act quickly though. EE's 60GB giveaway for its 40GB iPhone 13 plan runs out on Thursday, July 28. The iPhone 13 is available at EE in all six colour schemes - Product (RED), Midnight, Starlight, Green, Blue and Pink. The £57 a month and £50 upfront payment price is for the 128GB iPhone 13, but if you want to get the 256GB or 512GB handsets you can also get 100GB for the price of 40GB. This plan with the 256GB iPhone 13 is £63 a month with a £50 upfront payment while the 512GB handset is £71 a month with a £50 upfront payment.
