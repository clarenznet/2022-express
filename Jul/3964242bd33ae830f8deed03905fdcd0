Tom Cruise, 60, braved the blistering heatwave yesterday as he stepped out wearing a suit. The Top Gun actor looked in great spirits as he attended the RIAT Airshow atÂ RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. For the event, where he greeted other attendees and waved at cameras, Tom donned a navy suit with a white shirt and blue tie. He completed the look with black shoes and accessorised with a pair of aviator sunglasses.
