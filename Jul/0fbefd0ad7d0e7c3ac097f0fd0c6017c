Tonight’s EuroMillions jackpot is worth an unbelievable £184 million. There’s nothing to say it couldn’t be a UK ticket holder this evening given the brilliant luck Brits have had recently with the National Lottery game. A total of 14 UK National Lottery winners have bagged prizes of more than £100 million in the history of the draw. What’s more, there have already been three UK EuroMillions jackpot winners this year alone. Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester scooped a record-breaking £184 million Euromillions jackpot in May. One of the biggest ever prizes won in the UK was claimed by Colin and Chris Ward, from North Ayrshire, Scotland, who won £161million in 2011. Another anonymous British player won £170 million in October 2019, showing that luck could definitely be on Britain’s side tonight. Even if no one wins tonight, it will be rolled over, with the winnings capped at €230 million. Operator Camelot estimates the cap will be reached in the draw on Friday, July 8, if it isn't won this evening. A win for a British player tonight would also make the UK the luckiest EuroMillions nation, overtaking France’s 117 wins to date since the first draw in February 2004. Tonight's National Lottery EuroMillions winning numbers are: 07, 10, 25, 45, 48. The Lucky Stars are: 03, 06. Tonight's estimated jackpot is £184 million.
