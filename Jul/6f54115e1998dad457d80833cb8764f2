Manchester United confirmed their second signing on Friday and might unveil a third today with Lisandro Martinez poised to join Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen as a new player at Old Trafford. Arsenal have lost out in the race to sign the Ajax defender and will move on to alternatives. United confirmed the arrival of Eriksen on a free transfer on Friday afternoon. And the versatile Martinez will soon join him for £46million while the Red Devils continue to try and sign Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong. Arsenal have made four signings and wanted Martinez as their fifth. Instead, they will move on to Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko and are hopeful of wrapping up a £35m agreement imminently. Tottenham have been another club busy but they are set to confirm Djed Spence as arrival number six for a fee of £12.5million rising to add-ons. Spence completed his medical on Friday.
