The carvery chain said the meat "had been removed for the time being". It confirmed the change after diners took to Twitter to ask why lamb was no longer on the menu. Toby Carvery - which bills itself as "the home of the roast" - said "ongoing stock issues" were to blame, reports Wales Online. Sweet_Sam09 asked: "Hope the rumour I have not heard is true... No more lamb on a Sunday??!!!!! I won't be coming back now as it's the lamb we want... Sad times." In response, Toby Carvery said lamb was no longer on the menu on Sundays, "for now" - with the meat lover saying that they were "gutted" at the news. In reply to another Twitter user, butcher809, the chain also said: "The lamb is now only available on specific dates for the time being this is due to a supplier issue." It added: "The lamb is only being offered on selected Sundays for the time being due to ongoing stock issues. "We do hope to have it back to every Sunday as soon as possible. We're sorry for any disappointment." The change appears to date back to May, with whosaidwhat0 posting on Twitter at the time: "Outraged. No lamb on @tobycarvery any more. Time to find a new carvery to go to." People flocked to Wales Online's Facebook page to share their views on the issue. One person said: "We have been to Toby a few times, never been offered lamb as an option, just gammon, turkey or beef". Another person commented: "In all the times I’ve been there's never been Lamb! Didn’t even know it was an option." A third person, who saw the funny side, wrote: "Not serving lamb? Has the poor lamb been baaard from entering the premises? Still. No need to bleat on about it."
