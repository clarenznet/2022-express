Sinitta, 58, looked ageless as she appeared at Wimbledon today for the men’s final. Her outing comes after revealing her heartache when on-off flame Simon Cowell broke their secret pact and started dating her “best friend” Lauren Silverman in 2013. Sinitta was heartbroken because she believed the pair would be rekindling their romance around the same time. On Sunday, the popstar showed off her toned legs in a white summer dress with brown espadrille sandals. Sinitta protected her face from the sun while wearing a white Louis Vuitton sun hat. She famously dated the music mogul, 62, in the 1980s when she was signed to his label, Fanfare Records, but confessed she “wanted to still be with him” into the early 2010s and “genuinely thought they were working things out”. Speaking to MailOnline at Metro's 50 Years of Pride celebration, sponsored by Visit Malta, in London, she added that she has accepted it was “unrequited love” and is now keen on officiating his upcoming wedding to Lauren in her capacity as an ordained minister.
