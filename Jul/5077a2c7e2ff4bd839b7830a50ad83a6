Love Island 2022 is back with even more drama and the Casa Amor recouping is sparking shockwaves through the villa. Stay updated with all the latest drama while away on holiday with these simple tricks. Love Island 2022 is back on TV screens and has been running for several weeks with Casa Amor set to happen soon. Casa Amor is Love Island’s infamous custom where the men and women are split into two villas, secretly, and they meet new bombshells that threaten their existing couplings. If you’re heading overseas or already abroad on holiday, Love Island’s channel, ITVHub, isn’t available to access as its geo-restricted. But don’t worry, there’s a simple trick to use to stream from ITVHub outside of the UK. The solution is to use a VPN, which is completely legal and here is how you can watch Love Island abroad. A VPN is a simple tool you can download and what it does is that it suggests that you’re using a UK-based IP address so that you can be free from any content-restricting issues. Here are a few simple steps on how to do. To watch episodes that are already live, go to ITV Hub. Remember, you can use a VPN to watch Love Island on ITV2 but you need to have a TV license to watch any UK TV show from overseas.
