As we enter July and approach the month-mark of the summer transfer window, the dealings across the Premier League and Europe are showing no signs of slowing down. Tottenham Hotspur are on a recruitment rampage and Manchester United have woken from their slumber as clubs gradually return for pre-season training. Tottenham have already signed Fraser Forster, Ivan Perisic and Yves Bissouma ahead of Antonio Conte's first full season as head coach. But Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici are hoping to provide him with THREE more additions before Spurs return for pre-season on Monday. Meanwhile, United are closing in on quickfire deals for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia. And Erik ten Hag hopes to hijack Arsenal's interest in versatile Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez, with further developments expected. Raphinha is also central to another of Europe's most enticing transfer sagas. After he looked certain for a Chelsea switch after the Blues trumped Arsenal's initial offer, Barcelona, his dream club, have returned to the table. Updates on all of that and much more to come!
