As Britain braces for record-breaking weather in excess of 43C, water providers could be forced to restrict usage if there is no rainfall in the coming weeks. During the latest heatwave, a spokesman for Southern Water, which supplies Hampshire, West Sussex and the Isle of Wight, said the daily amount of water used by its customers had spiked by “hundreds of millions of litres”. He said: “We do not anticipate a temporary use ban across the whole region. However, it is increasingly likely we will require extra measures in certain areas where water is scarcer and the pressure on supply is greatest, such as Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.” Southern Water said it wanted to keep “disruption to a minimum” but urged customers “use water wisely at all times”. Bans are dictated by local water supplies and anyone caught using a hosepipe could be prosecuted and fined up to £1,000. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
