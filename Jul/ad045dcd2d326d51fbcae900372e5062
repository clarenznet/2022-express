With Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak campaigning doggedly in the face of Mr Johnson’s resignation last month, his former adviser Baron Moylan - formerly Daniel Moylan - said: “The civil service has got to be an organisation which embraces change, especially Brexit. “And it isn’t - it’s brought up to embrace keeping everything the way that it is. “It’s been very happy doing that, as well as taking its directions from Brussels for 50 years.” Brexit Opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg this week launched a wide-ranging review to investigate whether civil servants were implementing the decisions of ministers properly, to be chaired by ex-Trade Minister Lord Francis Maude. Lord Moylan added: “Jacob is completely right. I haven’t got a clue what the solution is, but then Jacob is paid to find solutions, not me.” Earlier this week it was revealed Ms Truss urged Mr Johnson’s then-adviser Dominic Cummings to scrap hundreds of “woke” civil service jobs.
