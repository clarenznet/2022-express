Nearly half of Tory voters do not want Mr Johnson to resign, a new poll has found. The study of the views of 2,500 people by Public First found that 70 percent thought Mr Johnson should have quit as Tory leader, against 21 percent who thought he should have stayed. But among Conservative voters, the survey found 45 percent thought he should have quit – but the same proportion thought he should not have done. Meanwhile, campaigners claim 13,000 Tory Party members have now signed a petition calling for a second members’ ballot on whether Mr Johnson should stay as Prime Minister. The revival of support for Mr Johnson comes amid mounting criticism of the "aggressive" and low brow attacks being launched from both Team Truss and Team Sunak. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
