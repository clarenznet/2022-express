Constabularies have noticed a rise in pets being unattended in vehicles during the 30C heatwave and officers have, in some cases, broken windows to help the dogs. Kent Police, for example, issued a reminder on Facebook, in which the force said dogs suffer hugely in the heat - and it can cause their deaths. The post, liked by hundreds of people, read: "Never leave your dog unattended in a car in warm weather. This appears to be quite commonplace in supermarket car parks, where the owner thinks they will be a matter of minutes but inevitably ends up taking longer.  Dog owners have also been warned that they should keep an eye out for theirÂ pooch licking their paws. This is because dogs will often lick their paws if they are in pain from paw burn. Dogs are at risk in hot temperatures because they are not able to cool down through sweating, as humans do - and breeds with long coats are especially prone to overheating.
