Rocker Rod Stewart's daughter Ruby, 35, is his child with former model Kelly Emberg, who is now a successful model herself. Over the weekend, Rod and Ruby had an emotional reunion in Dallas, Texas after he played two shows in the state. The wine was flowing during their time together, as one video clip posted to Rod's page suggested. "Well we've just started the tour, which is me in..." he began, before bursting out laughing, unable to continue, and burying his head playfully on his daughter's shoulder. Glamorous daughter Ruby finished his sentence, adding: "...in the United States of America, so you should come out!" Rod posted the video clip to his Instagram page, noting sheepishly: "Perhaps I should have recorded my enthusiasm for the kick-off of the tour tonight BEFORE the glass of wine!" Meanwhile Ruby has posted footage of the rocker playing with a large husky dog and sitting together with her, which she titled "Hanging with my papa Stew."
