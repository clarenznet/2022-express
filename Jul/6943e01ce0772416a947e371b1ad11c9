Manchester United have reportedly agreed personal terms with Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia as he prepares to put pen-to-paper on a deal at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old could become the Red Devils’ first signing of the summer transfer window as new boss Erik ten Hag looks to build a team that can compete for honours in the Premier League and the Europa League.  United suffered a dismal season last time around as they exited the cup competitions in the early rounds and finished a lowly sixth in the Premier League table. And they are in desperate need of new faces if they want to compete for trophies. The 13-time Premier League champions have been linked with a whole host of players, including the likes of Barcelona ace Frenkie de Jong and former Brentford star Christian Eriksen as well as Ajax trio Jurrien Timber, Lisandro Martinez and Anthony. And it appears they could now be set to finally get a deal over the line. According to The Athletic, Malacia has agreed a four-year contract at United with the option of an additional year. And he could undergo a medical over the weekend, although the deal has not yet been signed.

But United have outbid the Ligue 1 side by offering Feyenoord a deal worth up to just shy of £14.7million for the ace, which includes a sell-on clause. And the player appears to be chomping at the bit to move to the Premier League. Malacia came through the Feyenoord academy before making his first-team debut in December 2017. He has gone on to rack-up 136 appearances for his current side, contributing four goals and 10 assists. The ace has also won five caps for the Netherlands.

Luke Shaw and Alex Telles shared the left-back role throughout the campaign but were far from convincing at times. And Malacia will be confident of making the position his own if the deal ultimately goes through. Ten Hag got the opportunity to work with some of his United players earlier this week as the Red Devils started pre-season training. And another 15 stars are reportedly set to return to the club next week after enjoying an extra few days off following the June internationals. The United boss will be keen to complete any new signings as early as possible. And Malacia would be a welcomed arrival at Old Trafford. Express Sport giveaway - win a 55" OLED LG TV here
