PS5 fans in the UK that have tried many times to order the in-demand console to no avail have been delivered some great news from Amazon UK. The online retail giant has just revealed a new way to order the PS5 in the UK which should help PlayStation gamers avoid the typical rush to secure an order when limited amounts of stock become available. Amazon UK has just added a new 'request invitation' button to the PS5 page. This new feature is available for high demand items, with customers having to request an invitation in order to be able to order the product. Amazon says not all requests will be granted, but this new system should help ensure genuine customers - and not bots - snap up stock as well as avoiding typical scenarios where there's a huge rush to purchase a PS5 when stock becomes available, and it sells out in a matter of minutes. To request an invite to purchase a PS5 at Amazon UK simply head to the PlayStation 5 product page and then click 'request invitation'. This shakes up how Amazon had previously handled PS5 orders, with the online retail giant in the past giving 'priority' access to Amazon Prime members. If you want to Amazon also offers monthly payments so you can spread out the cost of your PS5. One option that's available is 12 monthly payments with 10.9 percent APR which will cost £39.75 a month.
