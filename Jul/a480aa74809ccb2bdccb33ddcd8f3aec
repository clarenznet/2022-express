The fruit is rich in potassium – which lowers blood pressure. Regular consumption combats cardiovascular disease, say scientists.  It even cuts the harmful effects of a high salt diet. Salmon and avocados also have high levels of the chemical. Professor Liffert Vogt, of the University of Amsterdam, said: “Health advice has focused on limiting salt intake but this is difficult when our diets include processed food. Food firms can help by swapping standard salt for a potassium salt alternative.” The study is published in the European Heart Journal.
