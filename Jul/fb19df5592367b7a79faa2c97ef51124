Ginger Spice Geri Halliwell, who now takes her husband's surname, first met Christian way back in 2009 courtesy of former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. Though it was reported that they dated for just a few months before their marriage, the pair had been quietly building a bond for several years before they ever told the world they were together. Initially, Christian had been with long term partner Beverley Allen, but there was chemistry between him and Geri - and after his relationship broke down, they began their own. The happy couple were married in May 2015 and had a baby boy, Montague, soon afterwards, in January 2017. Christian reportedly quickly hit it off with Geri's daughter from a previous relationship, Bluebell Madonna, who walked her mother down the aisle at the wedding. The family's idyllic family home even played host to the Spice Girls' 2018 reunion meeting.
