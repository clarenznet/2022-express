Two Cabinet ministers have dismissed claims the Prime Minister has told allies he will be back within a year, saying it was just "speculation and tittle tattle". Therese Coffey, the Work and Pensions Secretary who is backing Liz Truss as the next prime minister, said "understandably a lot of people supported Boris" but conceded he "chose to step down" and would "continue to be supportive of the next Conservative Prime Minister and into the next election." She added: "He has stepped aside and will be stepping down as Prime Minister in due course". Fellow ministers Sir Robert Buckland, the Welsh Secretary, conceded the party had moved on and there was no chance of the PM returning, adding: "His time in office is coming to an end and that means a new chapter for him and a new chapter for the Conservative Party." COMMENT:Â Bring Back Boris campaign is getting louder - the people will be heard The ballot will open next week, giving Converstaive members up and down the country the chance to elect either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss as the next party leader - and, in turn, the next prime minister. But with more than 10,000 people signing a petition to keep Mr Johnson in Downing Street, it seems members are conflicted. David Campbell Bannerman, a former Tory MEP who set up the petition, said getting rid of Mr Johnson would be "guaranteeing a Labour victory" at the next election, and wrote on the petition that "the membership are very upset about what has happened to our elected leader". So, is it time for Boris Johnson to step aside or should he be allowed to stand in the Tory leadership contest against Ms Truss and Mr Sunak?
