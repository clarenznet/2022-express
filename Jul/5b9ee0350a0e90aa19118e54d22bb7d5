You are trying to get a close friend to see if they are getting too deeply into something that isn’t good for them. If you’re running out of time to get them to change their minds, forget about niceties and tell them exactly why their actions could get them into trouble. It is time to let some secret ambitions you have about reaching an ambitious goal out into the open. Either through letting someone who is in a position to help you know what is on your mind or by taking action to better your chances of getting on. Results of a work project are better than expected. Someone will be so impressed by what they see that they will want to copy your methods and ideas. Although you will feel flattered by their comments, there are some secrets you should keep to yourself.  Increasing harmony in the home has a lot to do with your partner or an older relative’s change of plans. You had never liked the idea in the first place and you will be relieved they have changed their minds. If there are bridges to be mended with others, now is the time to get started on this. Finances will receive a boost of some description if they haven’t done so already. A relative is in line for a well-deserved promotion. There are ways to cut costs if you’re currently making improvements to your home. Tackle jobs that need to be done in order of priority. You would do well to ponder on the behaviour, actions and comments of those around you. If you look hard enough and if you refuse to be blinded by someone’s easy charm, you could discover there’s a side to them you wouldn’t have thought existed.  It’s hard to control a desire to drop everything and take off anywhere just as long as it isn’t where you are at the moment. Let those who are with you know how you feel. Someone close could surprise you with their willingness to add a touch of spontaneous adventure to your day. You can’t rely on hints or being in any way vague if you want to reach an agreement in family conversations. If there is something worrying you, take a deep breath and spit it out. Others will respect you for doing so. Promote honesty in all relationships. A challenge you have taken on won’t be as easy as it looked. In addition to you having to find a way to achieve this aim, someone you work or live with is being negative about your efforts. This will be more through twinges of jealousy than any solid reason.  You would preferably not be anywhere but within your own four walls or at a special place where you always feel relaxed. You aren’t likely to feel much of a desire to be out and about for long periods of time. An upset within the workplace will soon be forgotten. If you’re keen to find a new way of earning a living, someone you speak to in-person or online could point you in the right direction. A respected executive will put in a good word for you. Job interviews, auditions and tests connected with your work will go better than expected. A friend or someone in the family who has given you a lot of support recently will now show signs of backing off a little. Don’t take this the wrong way. They can see you are ready to manage some things on your own and it is time now for you to stand on your own two feet.
