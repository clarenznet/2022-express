Hope everyone is okay!" It comes as the UK is facing travel disruption, closed schools and health warnings as the country braces for extreme heat over the next two days. The mercury is set to soar into the high 30s, and possibly past a sweltering 40C as the heatwave sweeps the country. The first ever red extreme heat warning has been issued by the Met Office across a swathe of England for Monday and Tuesday. London is predicted to be hotter than the Caribbean, the Western Sahara and popular holiday destinations in Europe. The chief executive of the Met Office confirmed Britain "may well see the hottest day in history" today. And Tuesday is expected to be even hotter, with some forecasts estimating highs of 43C (109F).
