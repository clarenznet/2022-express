Amazon Prime Day kickstarted today with prices across thousands of products. Only running for two-days, Amazon has just unveiled a massive bargain on the Oral-B iO4 toothbrush. If you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial here in order to make the most of the sale. The Oral-B iO4 Electric Toothbrush is Amazon’s bestseller in ultrasonic toothbrushes and is the ultimate in oral care. Designed with revolutionary iO technology, the typically pricy toothbrush has now been slashed by 63 percent off. While it’s expensive, this toothbrush gives you a professional clean with a dentist-inspired round brush and helps improves gum health, making it a worthy investment considering the everyday use. There are four brushing modes that shoppers can choose to personalise their brushing - Daily Clean, Whitening, Sensitive and Super Sensitive. In addition, there’s no need to worry about whether you’re brushing your teeth incorrectly as it’s got a smart pressure sensor that flashes green, white or red to let you know whether you’re applying too much or little pressure. For a limited time, the Oral-B iO4 toothbrush will be slashed to just £89.99, saving £150 off its original price. You can buy it with free delivery on Amazon but hurry – Prime Day ends on July 13 at midnight.
