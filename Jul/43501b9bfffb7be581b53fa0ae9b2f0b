England are facing off against Austria as Women's Euro 2022 begins in the UK. Kick-off for the opening game is 8pm tonight with BBC broadcasting every single game exclusively. You can tune in on BBC One or if you want to watch online you will be able to see all the action on iPlayer. The Lionesses will be hoping to clinch England's first major international tournament since the famous 1966 triumph for the men's team. And they will be able to do it on home soil with the final for this year's Women's Euros taking place at Wembley later this month. At the last Euros the England Women's team reached the semi-finals stage. While at the most recent World Cup the England Women's team were knocked out in the fourth road. However, the Lionesses will be buoyed after winning an international invitational a few months ago. The England's Womens team won the first ever Arnold Clark Cup in February with Spain runners-up. BBC will be exclusively broadcasting all the action from the Women's Euro 2022 tournament. Every game is being broadcast on BBC channels and BBC iPlayer, with the opener today being England vs Austria and Old Trafford. Kick-off is at 8pm UK time with the pre-match coverage starting at 7.10pm on BBC One. It's worth noting that those who are away on holiday and trying to watch outside of the UK won't be able to use BBC iPlayer due to geo-location restrictions.
