David Banda, Madonna’s 16-year-old adopted son from Malawi, turns heads wherever he goes. The star most recently stepped out in an Adidas x Gucci dress and yesterday, he posed in another streetwear style while making music with his famous mum. On her Instagram story, a very youthful-looking Madonna posed with her hair in two plaits while wearing a pair of large spectacles. The famous singer showed off her cleavage in a black bra, worn under a white fishnet top to cover her modesty. She kept the look casual by wearing a pair of black cargo trousers and trainers. Meanwhile, David wrapped up warm in a red hoodie paired with spray-painted jeans. The pair were in the recording studio appearing to work on new music, as Madonna typed “Ride or Die”, possibly hinting at the track's name.
