Christine Lampard, 43, sparked a fan frenzy over the weekend by sharing a series of rare pictures of her and husband Frank’s children. In the heartwarming snaps Patricia, three, and Freddie, one, could be seen wearing Everton kits labelled with their own names. The pair could be seen holding hands as they enjoyed the sunshine in the family’s sprawling garden. The Loose Women star captioned the pictures: “All kitted out! @everton @franklampard #everton #Toffees"
