Brad Pitt displayed a chipped front tooth yesterday as he attended the UK screening of Bullet Train in London. The Troy actor, 58, exuded rakish charm as he cut a casual figure in a dark brown velvet suit, which he paired with a t-shirt of a lighter hue. He wore his shiny brown locks in a wavy style which had been parted at the side. The Hollywood star finished his look with a pair of tinted black sunglasses as he smouldered on the red carpet alongside his co-stars. Brad appeared to be in good spirits as he posed expertly for snaps while joking around with the crowds who had turned out to see him.
