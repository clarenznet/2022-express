One, William Neville, 34 – a serving Metropolitan Police officer – was accused of “acting out a rape fantasy” for describing restraining a 15-year-old as a “struggle snuggle”. He is charged, along with another serving Met constable, Jonathon Cobban, 35, and former PC Joel Borders, 45, with sending “grossly offensive” messages, which also included racist comments. Couzens is serving a whole life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, 33, in March 2021. His messages were not read out due to continuing investigations. The three on trial previously served in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and transferred to the Met in 2019. Westminster magistrates heard that Neville messaged Cobban in the WhatsApp group to say he had “pinned a 15-year-old girl going mental on the floor.” He added: “I knew all the struggle snuggles would come in useful at some point.” Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: “He got pleasure from the detention of a 15-year-old girl with what he called a ‘struggle snuggle’." "We submit that this is acting out a rape fantasy.” In other messages, Borders allegedly described a colleague as a “sneaky bitch” who will “get me locked up when I rape and beat her.” He is also accused of writing: “I can’t wait to get on guns so I can shoot some **** in the face.” Cobban allegedly replied, saying he wanted to “Taser a cat and a dog”. He added: “Same with children. Zap zap you little *******.” Cobban, who volunteered to be a race and diversity custodian for his unit, also allegedly described Houns-low in west London as a “******* Somali ****hole” and patrolling it as “walking along a Dulux colour code.” He is accused of claiming domestic abuse victims “love” to be sexually assaulted. Neville, of Weybridge, Surrey, Cob-ban, of Didcot, Oxon, and Borders, of Preston, Lancs, deny the charges, which relate to improper use of the public electronic communications network. The trial continues.
