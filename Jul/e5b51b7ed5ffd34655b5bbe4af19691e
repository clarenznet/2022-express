Tray Veronica saw the particular weeds sprouting out of the 6ft long planter along a roadside in rural Dorset. West Parley Parish Council had hoped the new communal display would add a splash of seasonal colour to the area. But Tray alerted the authority of her find, and it took police advice, before removing the plant altogether. Tray said: "It was last Sunday I spotted the plants. I was taking my child to a friend's house. I just found it hilarious. The council were looking after these planters every day. "All the other plants are still in the planter. It’s just the cannabis that’s been removed. The planters do look so beautiful. The council did a great job with them. And I’m sure this was just someone’s idea of a joke." The council had even included the offending plants in a photo of the display on social media saying it was "looking lovely," reports Coventry Live today. The council said it became aware the plants may have been "tampered with" last week. A spokesperson for West Parley Parish Council said: "On 20th July, the parish council was alerted to a report concerning one of the village’s floral displays, which suggested it may have been tampered with and amongst the flowers was a plant not part of this year’s schedule. "On the advice of the police, the plant was located, removed and has been secured by the parish council and arrangements are being made to pass it on to Dorset Police for identification and destruction. An inspection has taken place of all the parish’s other planters, and this has not raised any further concerns." Summer is the busiest season for gardening with hundreds of flowers coming into bloom and a wide variety of crops ready to harvest. While some plants will reach their peak in early July, there are still plenty of things to sow, plant, and pick by the end of the month.
