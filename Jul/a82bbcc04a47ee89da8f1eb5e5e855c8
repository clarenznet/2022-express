Amanda Holden, 51, made pulses race as she showed off her incredibly toned legs in a yellow blazer and shorts co-ord from Alice and Olivia. The Britain's Got Talent judge wore platform heels to complete the outfit and styled her hair into effortless waves. Amanda has just returned from a visit to Sicily to film a new BBC series, The Italian Job, with comedian Alan Carr. Today, she turned up the heat in London as she posed in the offices of her Heart FM breakfast show studios while showing off an incredible view of the capital city. The actress wore a yellow floral blazer and matching shorts from Alice and Olivia on her Instagram Story, while copying Victoria Beckham's memorable leg pose to show off her flexibility. Discussing their upcoming show, Alan said: "After presenting two series of Interior Design Masters I feel now it’s time for me to pop my hard hat on, slip on my steel toe capped boots and really get my hands dirty. "Working in beautiful Sicily with one of my dearest friends is like I’ve won the jackpot. Expect a summer of drilling, demolition and hopefully la dolce vita!"
