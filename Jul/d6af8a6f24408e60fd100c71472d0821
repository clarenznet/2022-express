Bowel cancer campaigner Dame Deborah, who died last month aged 40, has been named on the "Vogue 25" list, which the fashion magazine says celebrates women who are "excelling in all corners of life". And Ms Zagahri-Radcliffe, 44, the journalist freed in March after being detained for six years in Iran accused of plotting to overthrow the government, is also listed. She appears alongside tennis star Emma Raducanu and the Queen. The full list features in Vogue's August issue.
