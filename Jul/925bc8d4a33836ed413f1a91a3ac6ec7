Madonna, 63, has caused a stir amongst her 18.4 million followers with another bizarre video. The Material Girl singer could be seen lying down on the grass and praying to God out loud in a montage that also showed her dancing as fireworks went off. In the clip, the pop star can also be seen toasting marshmallows over a bonfire and playing with pyrotechnics with her children. The video begins with a very youthful-looking Madonna, who can be seen wearing her sunglasses, saying: "Thank you God for the Earth, for this grass, for the Moon and the privilege of being out here in the countryside, because that is freedom.” She captioned the clip: "Give me liberty or give me Death!! #gettogether."
