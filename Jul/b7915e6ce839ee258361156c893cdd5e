Groceries in the 16 weeks to June 25 eased 2.4 percent following last year's Covid boosted numbers. Argos sales dropped 10.5 percent, while store general merchandise slumped 14.6 percent. Clothing sales were down 10.1 percent as rivals reopened. But boss Simon Roberts said the supermarket giant will stick to its forecast for full-year pre-tax profits before exceptional items of between £630-£690million. He added customers "look to Sainsbury's when they want to treat themselves." Platinum Jubilee booze sales were only bettered by Christmas and Easter.
