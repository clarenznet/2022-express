Research by consumer group Nous found that more than a third of all households will forgo their annual trip as they struggle with surging energy and fuel costs. Out of those who could afford a break, 25 percent had chosen a cheaper option than usual. Meanwhile, another quarter of households had ditched a foreign trip altogether and opted for a UK holiday instead. Last month British hotels, B&Bs and holiday parks recorded a 20 to 30 percent rise in inquiries as the chaos in airports made families think twice about heading overseas this summer. Businesses said a surge in last-minute bookings was providing a much-needed boost. UKHospitality CEO Kate Nicholls told The Daily Express: "With thousands of flights cancelled and the airport chaos of the Easter break still fresh in people's minds, many are looking to holiday in Britain again this year. "That's welcome news for the hospitality and tourism sector, which is facing soaring costs via energy, staffing and raw materials."  Kate added: "However, that's not to detract from the need to rebuild inbound tourism to pre-Covid levels and beyond, to drive growth and raise the value of tourism as an import." People also revealed that the financial crisis has forced them to give up luxuries, such as takeaways and buying new clothes, to help them make ends meet. Two-thirds of the 2,000 polled said they are cutting back wherever they can. Two in five said they are planning to shop more at budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. Nous CEO Greg Marsh said: "It's sad that people are having to cut back on their well-deserved annual holidays."
