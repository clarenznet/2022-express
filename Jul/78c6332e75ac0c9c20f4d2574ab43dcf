Princess Beatrice, 33, attended day 12 of the Wimbledon Championships in London. The royal wore a pink and white dress by one of her favourite brands, The Vampire's Wife. The £550 Falconetti floral-print ruffled silk dress finished just above the Princess's knee, providing a perfect silhouette. Beatrice's sleeves reached her elbows and she could be seen carrying a tweed handbag. The description on The Vampire's Wife website says: "The Vampire's Wife is certainly having a moment and you will too in this lightweight floral-print silk midi dress. "Featuring should pads, ruffle trims and the classic Vampire's Wife silhouette." Beatrice straightened her hair for Friday's outing, which she wore tucked behind each ear.  She accessorised with a big black pair of sunglasses as she sat in between her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and Princess Michael of Kent. Beatrice's handbag looked like it was made of straw with black handles on each side. As the Princess does not have her ears pierced, she was not wearing any earrings. Beatrice also opted against necklaces.   However, she did wear some gold bracelets on each wrist. The Princess also chose to wear a few rings on each hand. Edoardo looked very suave in a white blazer, light blue shirt and bottle green tie. He paired these with navy blue trousers and also protected his eyes from the sun with sunglasses.  His hair was perfectly combed back for the occasion and he could also be seen carrying a yellow pocket square. Princess Michael wore a blue and white dress today at Wimbledon. She then accessorised with white earrings, a white hand and blue necklaces. Fans of the Princess took to social media to praise Beatrice's style at Wimbledon on Friday.
