Sir Elton John, 75, has issued a warning that musicians, particularly younger and less-established artists, could find themselves “stranded in Dover” if Brexit barriers continue affecting those touring the European Union. Elton’s comment comes as a group of more than 100 MPs and peers issued a report calling on the government to remove red tape facing those in the music industry.The report, from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Music (APPG on Music), warns that the “UK music industry faces a touring crisis in Europe” due to “more costs, more complications and fewer opportunities after leaving the EU”.Issues laid out in the report include visa restrictions, new costs, transport difficulties and the shortage of drivers to haul event equipment.Elton told the APPG that these issues are problematic for rising stars in music and that the government missed a “golden opportunity” to fix things during Covid.

They told APPG: “It cost the band (and our fans) financially and emotionally, and shouldn’t have happened.  “We have the resources to pay experienced professionals to guide us through the red tape, but the reality for newer acts is that touring in Europe could become an impossible dream.”The band backed calls for a touring tsar to help solve the issues and prevent the music industry becoming a “cultural casualty of Brexit”.In response to the report, a government spokesperson told Express.co.uk: "We are supporting the UK's brilliant musicians to adapt to the new arrangements and make touring easier.
