Linda Nolan, 63, wowed in an elegant pale blue outfit as she dressed up to attend the wedding of her nephew Shane Roche. Shane’s parents are Linda’s younger sister Coleen Nolan and her ex-husband, Shane Richie. On Twitter, Linda showed off her sequin-covered dress, which she paired with a long blue cardigan and a matching hat. The singer wore glamorous makeup including a smokey eye look and nude lipgloss. She typed: “Massive love and congratulations to the new Mr and Mrs Roche. “It was a beautiful ceremony yesterday and I couldn’t be a prouder aunt/in-law!” Just a couple of weeks prior to the ceremony, Linda had to postpone a public appearance due to health reasons, as she continues to battle secondary breast cancer. Shane Jr married his fiancée Maddie Wahdan in a romantic ceremony at Rushton Hall in Kettering.
