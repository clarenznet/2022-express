The Duke of Cambridge made the announcement about the event in December 2022 in a short video released today. The future King had previously said the second awards ceremony for his ambitious global environmental prize would take place across the pond but had not confirmed where. In the clip, William said: "In 2022, we're back and bringing Earthshot to the USA where we'll award the next five winners of the prize." A post on the Kensington Royal Twitter account said: "The Earthshot Prize is back and this year, we're heading to Boston! "Five more winners. Game-changing solutions. More potential to save our planet. "Boston, we'll see you in December #EarthshotBoston2022." The inaugural Earthshot Prize awards ceremony was held in London last year. Winners in five categories were awarded £1million to develop their initiatives by the decade-long scheme aimed at finding solutions to save the planet. William and Kate dazzled as they stepped out for the evening event at Alexandra Palace. Speculation will no doubt be high over whether Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will attend this year's awards ceremony. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been living in California since quitting royal duties in 2020. William's announcement sparked an excited reaction from royal fans on social media. One Twitter user with the handle @JenCarsonTaylor commented: "Can’t wait!" Another, @WendyMea, wrote: "Congratulations to Boston. Enjoy." William and Kate fan account @loveforcambridg added: "Ahh I knew it. I love this video and I’m so excited for this year’s Earthshot Prize." Another, @monamm2175, replied: "Super excited." One more Twitter user, @judithin77, added: "So looking forward to the awards in December, very exciting!" William's Earthshot Prize was inspired by former US president John F Kennedy’s Moonshot plan in 1962 to land a man on the moon within a decade.
