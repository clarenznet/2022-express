Guidance from the College of Policing says people engaged in political and social debate should not be "stigmatised" because someone is offended. In the past five years, 120,000 people have been recorded even though their behaviour was not criminal. Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously said she fears "people may be inhibited from expressing views in a legitimate manner". Andy Marsh, the college's CEO, said: "The public rightly expect the police to focus on cutting crime and bringing criminals to justice. We also have a responsibility to protect freedom of speech. "This updated guidance puts in place new safeguards to ensure people are able to engage in lawful debate without police interference."
