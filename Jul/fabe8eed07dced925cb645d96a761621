The Duke of Cambridge, 40, was spotted by eagle-eyed viewers seemingly saying ""No, no, no, f***' in the Court One crowd during Cameron Norrie's quarter-final on Tuesday. A clip, posted on Twitter via the account @rdgboi13, appeared to show the future king, who is a keen sporting fan, caught in the moment whilst watching the match between Norrie and David Goffin. The twitter user, named Matthew, posted the video, along with the caption, "Haha Prince William saying no, no, no f*** it lol #Wimbledon". The Queen's grandson was caught on camera looking annoyed with his head in his hands. He can be seen mouthing "no, no, no f***" with a disappointed look on his face. He then goes to adjust his tie before looking around.
