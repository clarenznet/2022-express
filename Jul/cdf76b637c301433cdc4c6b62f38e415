To escape deflation, he invented "Abenomics" or the three arrows approach, based on a Japanese story of a father giving his three sons three arrows to break. They all broke single arrows, but when they were given three arrows each to break, they couldn't.  Shinzo Abe set three goals, monetary easing to control inflation at two per cent, boosting public spending and improving childcare to help more women into the workplace. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Japan's economy had grown by 13 per cent over seven years and he was widely credited with turning around the country's fortunes. A Right-winger, he also increased defence spending and set up a National Security Council, partly to match and monitor China's defence spending. He'd hoped to stage the Olympics in 2020 but the Games were postponed because of Covid-19 and he was accused of being too slow to react to the pandemic.  As the economy declined he was forced to resign in August 2020 when he was 65. He said at the time: "I have lost a lot of my energy and strength. It is gutwrenching to have to leave my job before accomplishing my goals." Born in Tokyo, Shinzo Abe's father Shintaro Abe was a politician who had trained as a journalist. His maternal grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was a controversial nationalist figure who was described by the Americans as a war criminal during the occupation of China in the 1930s. Abe, who had no children with his wife Akie Matsuzaki, was assassinated by a gunman using a homemade shotgun while on the campaign trail in the western city of Nara.  Shinzo Abe, born september 21, 1954 â€“ died july 8, 2022, aged 67.
