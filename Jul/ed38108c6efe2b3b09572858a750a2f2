The unnamed man, 46, was shot on La Mama beach, located in the Grand Parc Miribel-Jonage, on the outskirts of the French city of Lyon. French authorities said the shooting happened at 10.30am on Saturday, according to MailOnline. The suspected shooter, 76, is believed to have been annoyed by the man, who reportedly yelled insults at fellow visitors to the beach. Police then said the younger man performed a sex act whilst looking fixedly at a nearby woman. The two men then began to argue, with the row escalating until the suspect allegedly pulled a gun on the younger man and fired “at least three” shots. It is believed one of the shots struck the 46-year-old in the chest.  The man died at the scene from his wounds, despite receiving medical attention, reports Le Parisien. Local outlet France3 said the elder man surrendered himself to police when authorities arrived on the scene. Witnesses described the victim as an “exhibitionist”, surrounded by around 100 visitors to the beach. Following the incident, the area around the beach was cordoned off for forensic examination.  France3 described the alleged shooter as in possession of a firearm licence. It is believed the elder man brandished a hunting rifle, although it is unclear why he had brought the firearm to the beach. The elderly man was assessed on his suitability to be arrested, considering his age. He was then deemed fit and healthy to be taken into custody. ‘La Mama’ beach has been a nudist sunbathing destination since 2007, popular with locals in the Lyon area. It typically attracts around 3.5 million annual visitors.
