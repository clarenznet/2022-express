Penny Lancaster, 51, put her toned legs on full display when she attended the Wimbledon Men's Final in 2014 as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic battled it out on centre court. Penny's enviable legs looked tanned and toned in a short, lacy cream dress, as the rock legend's wife almost suffered a wardrobe malfunction in the sheer ensemble. She teamed her attire with matching strappy sandals. Penny arrived at the event with her son, who looked smart in a suit of his own.
