Lizzie Cundy, 54, has embraced the sun in Britain’s unprecedented summer heatwave. On day two of the sizzling temperatures, the star stripped down to racy swimwear.  The former WAG looked incredible in the pink and green cut out number as she posed for pics on the photo-sharing platform.  She posed for snaps in the sun, flaunting her figure in the daring swimsuit featuring a plunging neckline.  The star added she was about to head out on a bike ride as she posed on her bicycle.  She captioned the post: “On ya bike ! All inflated and ready to go ! Got my sunscreen, got my hat and lots of water. #keepcool #hottestdayoftheyear #swimwear @riverisland' she captioned the snap.”
