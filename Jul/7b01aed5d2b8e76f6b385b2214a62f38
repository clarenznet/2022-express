Ashley Roberts, 40, sported a black number as she left the studios today, despite the soarâ€Œing UK temperatures. The former Pussycat Doll looked great in her leather crop top and matching high-waisted shorts, putting her gym-honed pins on full display. She showed off her toned midriff in the racy outfit while out and about in London. Ashley styled the number with a small black clutch bag, black sunglasses and small heeled stilettos. The Heart FM DJ made sure the heat did not get in the way of her outfit choice, as the UK recorded its hottest ever temperature of 40.3 degrees yesterday. This comes as the former singer recently declared that she couldn't "give a f**k" what others say about her fashion choices, revealing she feels more confident than ever.
