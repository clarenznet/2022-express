Britney Spears, 40, has left fans stunned after she took to Instagram last night to share a series of topless pictures throughout different posts. The Toxic singer could be seen striking a number of poses while protecting her modesty in bed, wearing nothing but a tiny pair of thongs. In one of the posts, Britney could be seen covering her breasts with her hands as she lay on her side on the bed of her hotel in London. Some photos, shared with the singer’s 41.8 million followers, showed Britney laying on her front while giving the camera a sultry look. Fans of the pop star took to her posts’ comments’ section to express their concern over the new flurry of photos. Cjlove2323 said: “All is not right in Brit’s world. Something is very wrong and I’m worried about her.” Jazattackz added: “She looks like she's been crying.” Gninacolada commented: “You look sad in the first picture are you OK?”
