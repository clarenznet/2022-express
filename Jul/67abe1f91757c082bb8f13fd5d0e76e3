Toto Wolff has demanded the FIA finalise the new 2026 F1 regulations by September at the latest. The Mercedes team principal said it was vital teams received the final framework soon to ensure teams can start building their next car. The new 2026 regulations were supposed to be signed off at a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council this week. However, it is understood final adjustments to the regulations have not been completed, meaning the rules were not agreed. Instead, the FIA announced that the World Council was only given an update on the 'progress' of the new power unit regulations. This is likely to force Porsche and Audi to delay the official announcement of their F1 programmes. But, Wolff also warns time is running out to get the new power units ready for 2026.

But they also need to get done in the right way. And I have sympathy for the FIA to get it right. “I think it's not easy with all the incumbents and the new power unit suppliers to really get to a point that we're having detailed regulations that are ready to be signed. But I hope that it's not dragging out too long. I hope we can do this over the summer so we can start the autumn season with the engine regulations in place.” “I would hope that in September, we're having regulations. If everybody works in the same direction, then that would be good.” The FIA has confirmed the new rules will be ”finalised and presented before the next World Motor Sport Council meeting”.
