Notable “twin films” include reality TV satires The Truman Show and EDtv, period magician dramas The Illusionist and The Prestige, and Washington terror attack action flicks White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen. Now we can add male sex worker comedies Good Luck to You Leo Grande and How To Please a Woman to the list. Where the former was a theatrical two-hander starring Emma Thompson, this Aussie effort sticks to the broad comedy template of The Full Monty. British actress Sally Phillips rocks a convincing Aussie accent to play Gina, who works in finance and is stuck in a sexless marriage. On her birthday, her pals send her a stripagram (still a thing in Australia, apparently). Gina is mortified, but when topless hunk Tom (Alexander England) offers to do “anything” she wants, she asks him to do the housework. When Gina is made redundant, she has a ready-made business idea. Tom and his former workmates from a bankrupt removals company will be her house-cleaning hookers who cater for neglected women’s every need. There are some cringey moments and some mildly amusing ones too. But the likeable Phillips keeps us watching with another winning performance.
