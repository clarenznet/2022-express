Rod Stewart, 77, has revealed there is “nothing like being back on the road”. That was the caption to the photo he posted of himself in a hilarious getup, alongside a sunglasses-wearing emoji and a US flag. The We Are Sailing crooner donned a pair of sunglasses with the famous stars and stripes emblazoned on them, as well as a similarly decorated headband, which he wore around his neck. Rod is touring the United States before returning to the UK later this year, and he recently reunited with his daughter Ruby, 35, in Texas. In a playful video posted to Instagram account, the father-daughter duo were in fits of giggles. "Well we've just started the tour, which is me in..." he began, before bursting out laughing, unable to continue, and burying his head bashfully on his daughter's shoulder. Glamorous daughter Ruby finished his sentence, adding: "...in the United States of America, so you should come out!" Rod posted the video clip to his Instagram page, noting sheepishly: "Perhaps I should have recorded my enthusiasm for the kick-off of the tour tonight BEFORE the glass of wine!"
