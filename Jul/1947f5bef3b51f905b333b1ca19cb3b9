The Annual Regional Manufacturing Outlook published by Make UK, which represents manufacturers in Britain, and business consulting firm BDO examined the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the economies of each UK region. It analysed both the most recent official data and Make UK's quarterly data on a wide range of indicators, including orders, employment, and investment intentions. The report found that in 2021, the EU remained the most dominant market for UK goods, with an overall average of 49 percent exports to the bloc. Regions that saw the largest increase in EU exports were Wales (+2 percent, the Northeast (+2 percent), the East Midlands (+3 percent) and the East of England (+2 percent).
