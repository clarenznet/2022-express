During the latest episode of Celebrity Gogglebox Roman Kemp, 29, stormed off after his dad Martin Kemp made a "gross" sex confession as he dished on intimate details with his wife Shirlie Holliman. The father-and-son duo appeared on Friday's show (July 15), where they and other celebrities were tasked with watching the Netflix series How To Build a Sex Room. Roman, 29, threw the show into chaos when he walked off during the programme. It was in response to the necessity of an extra room to have sex in, Martin, 60, admitted that he and wife Shirlie "had sex in every room of the house", causing a horrified Roman to storm out. Martin said: "I don't want a room that's dedicated just to sex. "Why can't you just have sex everywhere? Me and mum [have sex] everywhere."

Express.co.uk asked Roman how he felt about presenting at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert earlier this month. He said: "My parents are so up on me in terms of never looking towards what the next thing is in terms of never looking and saying 'Oh well if I do that I can get that'. "Instead enjoy what you're doing in that moment and realise what a privilege it is that you're doing it! "I think that's what I am going to do. "I'm going to enjoy every single moment of that weekend and being part of that moment in history is something I'm very grateful for."
