Ms Mordaunt has found herself caught in yet another row as she is poised to launch a trade deal with North Carolina today - despite still being in the middle of the Conservative leadership race. An announcement is expected today of a new minor trading accord with North Carolina, US. A source said added: “Trying to take credit for the North Carolina deal in the middle of the race is totally inappropriate. Not least because she could not be a***d to go sign the deal with Indiana in May.” Another source added: “Penny is trying to neutralise the shirking minister stuff and its cutting up rough in the department.” But Ms Mordaunt's spokesman hit back: "Even in these busy times, Penny has been focused on ensuring that we take advantage of the benefits of Brexit by securing a trade deal with North Carolina and other US states, which will boost, GDP, growth and jobs. "The important work of Government must continue, and Penny will continue to lead the way in ensuring the UK secures state-level deals with the US." FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES....
