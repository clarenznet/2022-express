Three people were plucked from the water near Conwy Morfa Beach and two were rushed to hospital. However, one of these paddleboarders has since died. Ten police cars and four ambulances were among a large emergency service presence at a beach overnight. Conwy Lifeboat was also dispatched in the "multi-agency operation", which is believed to have lasted several hours. A North Wales Police spokesman said: "We received a call at 10.14pm last night (Thursday) reporting a group of paddleboarders in difficulty in the water off Conwy Morfa. "Officers attended alongside colleagues from HM Coastguard and Welsh Ambulance, who attended to three casualties. Two of the casualties were taken by ambulance to Ysbyty Gwynedd but sadly, despite the best efforts of all involved, one person passed away in hospital. "The local coroner has been informed, and specialist officers will be supporting the family of the deceased."  The Welsh Ambulance Service is yet to provide further details about the incident, or the nature or severity of the injuries. A spokesman said: "We received a call to the Conwy Morfa Car Park at 10.25pm, We responded with four Emergency Ambulances, and two Rapid Response vehicles, along with coastguard in assistance and the Coastguards Rescue 936 helicopter. "We conveyed two patients to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor - At present this is all we are able to share." Footage shared by North Wales Live shows a large police presence at the car park of the beach. The publication's reporter Aaran Lennox said at around midnight: "Two ambulances have just left on blue lights - escorted by police also on blue lights." A helicopter was seen circling the area at around the same time.  An HM Coastguard vehicle left the scene at approximately 1am. Conwy Morfa is a large sandy bay near the picturesque town of Conwy.
