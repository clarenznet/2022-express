Gwen Stefani wore a nude illusion top in Hollywood on Wednesday to pre-record tonight's Jimmy Kimmel Live! episode. The mother-of-three appeared likely to risk a wardrobe malfunction in a golden halter top.  However, the star shielded her modesty in a flesh-coloured undervest.  She was also wearing black fishnets underneath her cargo pants and pumps, selected by her stylists, Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn.  Gwen was dressed to impress for the Jimmy Kimmel show alongside Grammy winner Sean Paul.  The Jamaican rapper was dressed in a baggy red patterned sweater and black cargo pants, as well as matching New Balance trainers.  Stefani and the 49-year-old reggae rapper performed his new dancehall single Light My Fire - which was released on May 27 - for the first time in front of an audience.
