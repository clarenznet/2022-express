The One Show presenter Alex Jones looked sensational as she arrived to host the TRIC Awards today. The 45-year-old showed off her incredible figure in a form-fitting neon green dress. Alex posed with one hand on her hip, baring her shoulders in the beautiful dress with long sleeves. She styled the elegant number with some simple silver sandals. The mum-of-three wore her brunette locks styled in loose waves, and some eye-catching dangling earrings.
