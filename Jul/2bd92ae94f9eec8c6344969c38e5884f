Tom Cruise looks just like any teenage boy in adorable photos from his younger years. Unearthed 1981 snaps show him wearing a smart grey suit jacket and red tie with a white shirt, as well as some trusty double denim. Then just 19, Tom looks fresh-faced and a little shy - a far cry from the confident movie star we all know and love. He had just moved to New York to pursue acting, working as a busboy to pay the bills until he landed his big break in Taps. The Top Gun star will turn 60 on 3 July, and is said to be celebrating with two huge parties - one of which will be in the UKâ€™s Soho Farmhouse.
