Police made the discovery after Neath Port Talbot Council officers were called to land between Crofton Drive and Willow Grove in the Baglan area, Wales. They had received a report from a member of the public who had concerns about dead trees in the area. Upon closer inspection, council staff found holes had been drilled into the bases of eight semi-mature trees, WalesOnline reports. They also took soil and bark samples to Bartlett Tree Experts for analysis, confirming that tests found an "undiluted herbicide" (which, in large doses, can kill trees) was present in each of the trees. The council has informed South Wales Police of the deliberate damage and is appealing for anyone who knows anything about the poisoning to contact the council or police. A spokesperson for Neath Port Talbot Council said: "This chemical was used to deliberately poison these trees by pouring it into the drilled holes. “Once injected the chemical was taken into the vascular system of the trees and their rapid decline was then inevitable. "We appear to be seeing an increase of malicious intent towards trees throughout the county and will be monitoring the situation and if required will take further action.  "We would ask members of the public in this area who may have seen any suspicious activity around these trees to contact the council or South Wales Police." Neath Port Talbot Council's cabinet member for climate change and wellbeing, Cllr Jeremy Hurley, added: "This is vandalism and constitutes a criminal offence. Trees are vital to fighting climate change and are also crucial for our wellbeing. If anyone knows anything about these appalling acts please let either the police or the council know."
