The move follows a “common sense” change of Government rules, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab has announced. Previously, senior prison staff had to apply to transfer an extremist to a special security unit if there was evidence they were attempting to radicalise other inmates.  The wings were established in 2017 to stop terrorists spreading murderous ideology among prisoners. There are three special separation centres in the country – known as Jihadi Jails – and more could be established in future. A typical high-risk wing inmate was hate preacher Anjem Choudary, 55, jailed for five-and-a-half years for pushing support for Islamic State. The former solicitor, inspired generations of terrorists, including the killers of soldier Lee Rigby in south-east London in 2013. He was released on licence in 2018. One current Jihadi Jail inmate is reported to be Hashem Abedi, 25, serving 55 years for plotting the Manchester bombing with his brother Salman.  Mr Raab said: “With more and more terrorists being convicted and jailed for longer, we must prevent the most dangerous from radicalising the prison population. “We are changing the rules to target the most dangerous offenders so they can be sent from court to a separation centre. “We also need to pass our Bill of Rights, to safeguard our ability to make these common sense changes. That will prevent terrorists using the Human Rights Act to claim a ‘right to socialise’ in prison.” The three special units are at HMP Frankland in Durham, HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire and HMP Full Sutton in East Yorkshire. There are around 200 terrorists in British prisons. A similar number are in custody for non-terror crimes but considered to be a terrorist risk.
