Sisters Princess Beatrice and Eugenie always sweetly coordinate their outfits with each other on royal engagements. Whether it's a royal engagement, church service or a day at the races, Eugenie and Beatrice's ensembles always compliment each other perfectly. For instance, in 2017 the sisters coordinated their floral mini dresses at the Louis Vuitton x Vogue bash.  They both opted for black frocks with floral detail – Eugenie with a pretty yellow and white shade and Beatrice wearing red and white flowers. The royals also teamed their dresses with black boots for the event and even carried their matching Louis Vuitton handbags. The Princess showcased a more relaxed look in 2018 when they attended the Serpentine Gallery's Summer Party in London's Kensington. The royal pair looked very cool in pretty patterned dresses – Eugenie in a black and blue floral number and Beatrice in a sassy feather print, teaming her frock with a Wilfred Free for ARITZIA biker jacket.

The pair once again wore matching looks, with Beatrice picking a stunning dress by Jonathan Simkai and a saucer hat by Sally-Ann Provan. Eugenie wore a pretty floral dress by Erdem and also wore a Sally-Ann Provan boater hat like her sister. The sisters were the epitome of elegance back in 2015 when they attended Trooping of the Colour at Buckingham Palace.  Beatrice went for a smart beige coatdress with a black belt and headpiece, while Eugenie matched her sibling in a beige and black dress. Back in 2012, the sisters had another style win when they both wore grey and white outfits to Derby Day. Beatrice's shoes matched Eugenie's dress and vice versa, which was a sweet touch. The Princesses certainly stood out at Ascot 2014 in their vibrant outfits.

The royal sisters even wear coats in similar shades. Eugenie and Beatrice opted for different hues of blue as they attended the Christmas Day church service with the Royal Family back in 2015. The sisters did not match dress colours or patterns at the national service of thanksgiving to mark Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday in June 2016, but their different styles worked wonderfully together.  Princess Eugenie was radiant in a calf-length bright red dress and Princess Beatrice went for a busy geometric monochrome pattern. Beatrice and Eugenie kept to a similar colour scheme for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018. Eugenie chose a 1960s look with a chic lilac Gainsbourg dress while Beatrice wore a teal outfit by Roksanda.
