Nicole Kidman, 55, looked every inch the fashionista in Paris, standing out in a flowing chiffon black blouse and a skintight alligator print skirt. She wore her tresses in a light curl and opted for minimal make-up, showing off her phenomenal ageless complexion. Meanwhile, Keith Urban coordinated his outfit with his wife as he sported a black shirt, jeans, and chunky boots. The couple succumbed to the request to share a kiss, but a short peck turned into a passionate embrace as Nicole held the sides of her husband’s face. Vogue captioned the video on Twitter: "Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban share a moment of passion outside @Balencgia’s fall 2022 couture show." This comes after the Hollywood actress was mocked online for her catwalk debut at Balenciaga's haute couture show. StarlingV3 said: "I could have sworn I've seen Nicole Kidman walk like a human before, but you wouldn't know it from that Balenciaga runway she just did." SarahJayWard added: "If you think Kim's [Kardashian] walk was awkward, please go see Nicole Kidman's."
