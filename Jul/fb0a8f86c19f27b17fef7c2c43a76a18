Officers had been driving the patrol car to an emergency when it was involved in a crash on Mossbay Road at 9:30pm.  The vehicle collided with a red Suzuki car before going through the garden wall, with the two officers remarkably only suffering minor injuries. No one else was hurt in the incident. The road was closed late last night while the crash was investigated and the cars recovered.
