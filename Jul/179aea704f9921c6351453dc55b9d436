The threshold in which people pay tax has gone up so around two million low-income workers will pay no National Insurance at all, while many will see their tax reduced. The amount of extra money someone could get depends on how much they earn. The rate from when people will start to pay National Insurance rose from £9,880 to £12,570 on July 6. An estimated 30million Britons will be better off as a result.

Sarah Cole, senior personal finance analyst said: "This is just a tweak to a tax that has just been hiked. "For anyone earning just under £35,000 or less, moving the threshold will repair the damage inflicted by the National Insurance hike in April. "70 percent of people will see their NI drop below what they were paying before the rise." National Insurance is a tax on earnings, paid by both employed and self-employed workers. Britons must pay National Insurance if they’re 16 or over and are either an employee earning above £190 a week, or self-employed and making a profit of £6,725 or more a year. Once someone has reached state pension age, they no longer need to keep paying National Insurance.
