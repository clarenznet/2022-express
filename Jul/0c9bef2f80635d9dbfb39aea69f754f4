Paying the full annual bill in one go costs £693 on average, while the combined sum of 12 monthly payments totals £752 - £59 more, according to CompareTheMarket.com. This can bring much-needed savings as living costs soar, but only for those who can afford to stump up the full premium. Insurers charge extra for the privilege of paying in manageable monthly chunks, and for the credit checks they have to carry out to confirm customers are likely to keep up with payments. Most providers demand an initial deposit, which is usually 20 percent, then charge interest on the remaining 11 monthly payments. They do the same for home insurance but the difference is just £13, with monthly payments totalling £190 on average, against £177 for a lump sum.
