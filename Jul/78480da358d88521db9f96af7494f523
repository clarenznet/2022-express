The budget airline, easyJet, has issued a travel checklist for passengers. Britons could face some disruption at UK airports this summer due to staff shortages. easyJet tweeted: “We’ve worked with EASA to put together some handy tips to make sure you take off as smoothly as possible when you get on your flight.” EASA is the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and has put together tips to help passengers this summer. However, easyJet shared some of its own tips on Twitter, including a couple of things that passengers do all the time. It tweeted: “Check your seat number matches your boarding pass - we’ve all been there.” READ MORE: Plane passenger refused to give up seat for mum sat away from toddler Passengers that sit in the wrong seat could cause delays if they have to then switch with another person. easyJet added: “Know where your nearest exit is by listening to the crew instructions. “Think about how your behaviour could affect crew and other passengers. We all love a tipple at the airport, but please know your limits before boarding the flight. “Go and enjoy your trip!” UK passengers will be able to buy drinks at the airport but drunk passengers can upset other travellers. There have been several incidents where British passengers have had to be removed from the plane for drunken behaviour. EASA posted its tips for tourists on its website and worked with airlines and airports to create the list. It said: “Please be kind to all staff and fellow passengers. Wearing medical masks is still the best way to protect you and others from catching Covid and some countries and airlines therefore require you to wear a mask on the aircraft and other forms of transport. “Please check the rules in place at all steps of your journey to make sure you are prepared.” READ MORE: Staycation: The most beautiful tourist attraction in the UK - list Passengers are advised to check the local restrictions their destination before travelling.
