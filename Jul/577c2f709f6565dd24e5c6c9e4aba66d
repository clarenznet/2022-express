Sean Phipps, 51, had been on release on temporary licence in Bristol when he went missing on June 1. Police have now launched a renewed appeal to find him and said he might be anywhere along the South West Coast Path, which runs for more than 600 miles in Cornwall, Devon and parts of Dorset. Avon and Somerset Police have urged the public to call 999 if if they see Phipps, Bristol Live reports. The convicted kidnapper is described as a white man, about 6ft 2ins tall, though police say his appearance may now have changed. They also say that he may still be in the greater Bristol area, including North Somerset or South Gloucestershire, but he's known to walk or hitch-hike long distances and to steal bicycles for transport. Detectives are following up a number of sightings following previous appeals, but are also investigating the possibility that he may be using the South West Coast Path and could have reached Somerset, Devon, Dorset or Cornwall.  Police add that Phipps will sleep rough, camp out in rural areas or sleep in disused buildings. It's thought he may also approach people to ask for water or casual labouring work and forage for food in bins or crops. Phipps has previously handed himself in to police when wanted, police said. Officers have urged anyone who sees him to not approach him but instead call 999 and give the call handler reference number 5222130002. If you have any information about where he could be - however small - or to report a past sighting (since June 1) police urge you to call 101 or use the dedicated online form to send a message straight to detectives.
