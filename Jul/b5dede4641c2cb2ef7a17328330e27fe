And one in ten (11 percent) claimed the amount they watch on phones is “significantly” more than 12 months ago. More than two in five (43 percent) are turning to their mobiles to watch sports on the go, while 45 percent do so when the main TV at home isn't available. The research, commissioned by Sky Mobile, revealed the two must-watch sporting events this summer include the Women's Euros (36 percent) and Commonwealth Games (29 percent). It also emerged two-thirds are backing the home nations for a win this sporting season, with one in four expecting to see the Lionesses triumph at the Euros. More than six in ten (63 percent) also feel the run of the England men’s team to the final of last year’s Euros, has made them more excited for the women’s games this year. Ex-England and Arsenal star, Faye White, said: “2022 is going to be a golden year for British sporting stars, and I’ll be supporting the Women’s football team every step of the way. “I like to be part of the action, so I‘ll be with the many Brits keeping an eye on the latest when out and about.” The research also revealed four in ten of the fans polled sneakily watch sport on their phone while they’re at work, and one in five will happily cancel going to an event so they don’t miss the action. Another 18 percent will even take annual leave so they don’t miss out – while 12 percent would go as far as cancelling a holiday, according to the OnePoll.com figures. Paul Sweeney, managing director at Sky Mobile, added: “With half of Brits now using their phone to watch sport on the go, we want to make it easy for fans on Sky Mobile to keep watching. “So, to help, you can stream the Sky Sports app on the go and catch all the action as it happens – without eating into your data.”
