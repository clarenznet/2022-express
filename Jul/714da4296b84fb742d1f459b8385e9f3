As the frontrunners battled it out for the Prime Minister’s job in Westminster, Priti Patel and Ben Wallace placed their bets at the Qatar Goodwood Festival. Gripped by the action, the Home Secretary clung to the Defence Secretary as she cheered her selections home at the event. But anyone hoping for a tip on who to back in the two-horse race between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss was out of luck. Neither Priti or Ben have revealed their favourites – but you can bet they’ll back whoever wins the sprint for No10. Among the other familiar faces to attend the West Sussex event was former Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell, who looked sharp in a £109 monochrome frock by Ro&Zo. Former football manager Harry Redknapp also attended, below, looking dapper in a suit. Pop band Elle and the Pocket Belles put on a colourful display, posing in eye-catching matching outfits and hats. Attendees who may have expected a scorcher after last week’s heatwave ended up with cooler temperatures, with a high of 71F (22C). The 2022 Glorious Goodwood runs until Saturday, and Thursday is Ladies’ Day.
