The Met Office has extended a rare extreme heat warning for a huge portion of the UK, with temperatures now expected to peak on Monday and Tuesday. The forecaster today extended its amber 'extreme heat' warning to include Tuesday, July 19, which was originally only issues for Sunday and Monday. The Met Office warned of potentially major disruption to travel and utility supplies over the weekend and early next week, and also said the heat could cause adverse health effects “not limited to those most vulnerable”. Rail firms have warned trains may be subject to speed restrictions and cancellations thanks to high track temperatures, while the Met Office said roads could also be shut and flights cancelled. Three fires have been confirmed by the Ministry of Defence in Salisbury Plain today, after a live firing military training exercise caused the blazes. Fires have been reported on the Pembrokeshire coast near Tenby, in fields in Norfolk and North Yorkshire, and another at a solar farm in Dorset.
