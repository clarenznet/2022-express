Barbara Windsor made the soap role iconic and Jaime Winstone, who played the late Dame in 2017 BBC drama Babs, will star as a younger Peggy. The episode promises to unravel the Mitchells’ chequered past and is the start of a stormy journey for Phil (played by Steve McFadden) who has to confront long-forgotten truths. The show will feature characters in EastEnders history who have never been seen on screen, such as Peggy’s husband Eric (George Russo) and Billy Mitchell’s brother Charlie (Charlie Heptinstall). Jaime, 37, said: “It’s been such an honour to step into Peggy Mitchell’s shoes for the first time, and into Barbara’s shoes for the second time. There’s certainly a healthy amount of pressure when you’re taking on such an iconic role – I thoroughly enjoyed it. "Playing this role has really cemented my love and admiration for Barbara as I got to bookend my journey by playing Peggy Mitchell – I hope I’ve done her justice.”
