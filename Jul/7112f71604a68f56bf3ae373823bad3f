Samsung is running a great offer on its Neo QLED 8K TVs, with the South Korean tech giant giving away a Galaxy S22 Ultra when customers purchase an eligible high-end TV. The incredible money-saving offer, worth £1,249, is available across a range of tellies with the cheapest starting from £2,199. That will get you Samsung's 55inch QN700B Neo QLED 8K HDR Smart TV, and the good news doesn't stop there. This 8K TV usually costs £2,599 - with Samsung dropping the price by £400 right now, in addition to throwing in a phone worth £1,249 for free. You can also get up to £500 off the price of this telly when you trade in and recycle your old one for free. Plus, Samsung also lets you pay for your new TV with monthly payments and zero percent finance. Payments can be spread out between 12 to 36 months with you forking out as little as 10 percent upfront. This means you can purchase this Samsung 8K TV from as little as £54.98 a month. The QN700B comes in three different sizes - 55inch, 65inch and 75inch. Samsung is also giving away a free Galaxy S22 Ultra with two other 8K TVs. These models are the QN800B and QN900B, with these Samsung tellies having prices that start from £3,499 and £4,999 respectively. Like with the QN700B, both of these TVs also come with money off. The QN800B has had £500 taken off its price tag while the QN900B has £800 money off. Both of these TVs come in either 65inch, 75inch and 85inch sizes. If you like the sound of this deal then you need to act quick as the offer isn't lasting forever. The free Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is available with select Samsung TV models until August 16. Once you've purchased your TV from the Samsung website, or a participating retailer, you need to head to this site to claim your free Galaxy S22 Ultra. The handset you get will come in black and claims for your free phone need to be submitted within 30 to 60 days of purchase. Other retailers that are involved in this promotion include Argos, AO.com, Currys, Very and Amazon.
