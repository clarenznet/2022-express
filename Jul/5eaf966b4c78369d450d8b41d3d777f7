Johnny English Strikes Again star Dame Emma Thompson, 63, looked fabulous as she went braless in a dazzling outfit for the 1996 premiere of the film Sense and Sensibility. During the high-profile event, Dame Emma met Prince Charles, who could be seen shaking the actress’ hand, in unearthed pictures. Emma was the epitome of chic after opting for a two-piece co-ord outfit, consisting of a grey and light blue jacket and floaty trousers. She completed the look with a winged eyeliner look and a bold red lip, as she styled her curly honey tresses up in a voluminous hairstyle.
