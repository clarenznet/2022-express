Boris Johnson delivered exactly as promised. The only problem being, he lived the life of a rock star – live fast and die young. Yes he made mistakes and yes he told some porkies but don’t forget that’s what politicians do for a living. Read Carole’s column in last Saturday’s Daily Express to see what I mean. The Cabinet have stabbed him from every conceivable angle and not one of them can fill his boots. I fear they’re all going to come to their senses and realise, “My God what have we done?” I hope I’m wrong. Mick Horsman, York ----------------------------------- Carole nails dozy Tories who stabbed Boris in back How right Carole Malone is, saying that the Conservative Party has shot itself in the foot by ditching Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which is something that I’m sure many are already regretting. So what’s to stop Boris from putting himself up for re-election? That would really show ’em! Colin Humphries, Ringwood, Hants ----------------------------------- Duplicitous Cabinet have hands covered in blood In her spot-on article, Carole Malone listed everything I and many of my friends and family have been saying about these back-stabbing, posturing Cabinet ministers. I wonder how many more agree with Carole’s thoughts? John Howard, Hemel Hempstead, Herts ----------------------------------- Conservatives committed suicide and lost my vote Thank you, Carol Malone, for last Saturday’s column. What a treat it was to read your opinions and good old-fashioned common sense – I agree with your every word. The Conservative Party has committed suicide. I have voted Tory for 40 years but after ousting the best leader since Margaret Thatcher I will never vote Conservative again. Betty Croxford, Huddersfield, W Yorks
