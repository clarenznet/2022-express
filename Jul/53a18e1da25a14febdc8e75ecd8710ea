It is just under two weeks until Manchester United kick off their Premier League campaign at home to Brighton on Sunday August 7. And it is fair to say that most supporters will be in agreement that a lot needs to be done before now and then in the transfer market if Erik ten Hag is to enjoy a successful first campaign as manager at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have so far brought in three new faces, with Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez freshening up the squad. But the situation regarding the longest-running transfer saga of the summer - the pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong - is yet to be resolved, and fans of United will be desperate for a decision one way or the other soon. Meanwhile, the club reportedly have a new target in Red Bull Salzburg's 19-year-old striking sensation Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian has been turning heads with his performances of late, although United may find it tricky to convince the Austrian club to sell. Oh, and there is also the small matter of the future of Cristiano Ronaldo. Will we ever see him pull on the famous red No.7 shirt again? Or is he bound for pastures new this summer? All will be revealed in the coming days and weeks. FOLLOW ALL THE LATEST MAN UTD NEWS BELOW...
