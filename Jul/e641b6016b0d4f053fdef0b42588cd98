Celebrity Gogglebox has been on screens for weeks each Friday on Channel 4, but this week saw a Celebrity "best of" for last year replacing the standard weekly show. Fans of the show made their anger known as they took to social media to accuse the channel of "ruining" their night and even their week. The Channel 4 narrator even hinted at a strong reaction from fans as he introduced the show. The announcer stated: "Now, strong language, adult humour, scenes of a sexual nature, full frontal nudity, and scenes of violence. "Now, remember when Channel 4 did that complaints welcome thing? "Well, I think we're going to test that right now. READ MORE: Outlander’s Marsali Fraser star opens up on Caitriona Balfe meeting "It's Celebrity Gogglebox... The Best Bits... from last year." Old clips of The Voice stars Anne-Marie and Tom Jones, as well as actress Denise van Outen and her ex-partner Eddie Boxshall, were among the highlights shown. Gyles Brandreth and Maureen Lipman also appeared, despite the fact that Gyles has recently been appearing with former Countdown star Carol Vorderman. Also in the episodes were Derry Girls stars Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee O'Donnell. It wasn't long before fans began complaining about the unexpected episode. Twitter user @PaulAllen2022 commented: "Get in the bin C4 with your ‘best bits from last year’ ruining my Friday night. #Gogglebox #celebritygogglebox." @Bobbie_Print fumed: "Noooooo #gogglebox best bits, ergh....does anyone like the best bits episodes?!

The two split earlier this year after seven years together. Their breakup came as rumours of Eddie cheating on Denise circulated. The couple often appeared on older instalments of Celebrity Gogglebox, giving their views on the week's television. Gogglebox is available to watch on All4
