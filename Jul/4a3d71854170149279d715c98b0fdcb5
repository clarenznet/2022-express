Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, who turns 46 today, have been married for over a decade and appear to be the epitome of a loving and private celebrity couple. During their time together the couple have also welcomed three children, India, Tristan and Sasha to their Australian home, and got matching tattoos to commemorate their family. Both Hemsworth, 38, and Pataky have five symbols of the Runic alphabet tattooed on their forearms.The symbols correlate to the English letters C, E, I, T and S.These are the initials of each family member: Chris, Elsa, India, Tristan and Sasha.Hemsworth is not the biggest fan of permanent body art, having before said to People magazine that tattoos are “a pain to cover up when you shoot a movie”.Pataky on the other hand has a dozen smaller tattoos sprinkled across her body, all of which have significant meaning for the model and actress, one of which many see as fate.  Decades before meeting her superhero husband, Pataky got a tattoo on her bicep as a teenager which was inspired by Thor.Pataky claimed she liked the symbol and the legends surrounding Thor and “wanted to keep it”.She would later go on to marry the first and only actor so far to portray the Norse God of Thunder in the Marvel universe, getting to keep her very own Thor.The couple originally met in 2010 and would get married that same year, shocking some fans who had just found out they were dating barely two months before the wedding.At the time Hemsworth had not yet broken through into Hollywood although he was a household name in Australian TV. Pataky on the other hand had been a prevalent name in the industry for well over a decade and met the would-be Marvel star through a talent agent.Hemsworth shared on Good Morning Britain in 2016 that the marriage “just felt right”.He said of the speedy wedding: “We had a holiday with both our families at the same time, just randomly and then said this is a good opportunity, we’ve got everyone together so let’s do this.”Although they have become an iconic couple in Hollywood, Pataky was not entirely comfortable with one unchangeable aspect of their relationship at the start.Pataky’s modelling looks may not show it but she is seven years older than Hemsworth and it made her unsure of what their relationship might look like from the outside.    She revealed to Female First: “I imagined he wouldn't want to start a family any time soon, so I didn't initially think it would work out. But it turned out that he thought the same way I did."The relationship would continue its fast pace, with the pair welcoming their first child, India, less than two years after getting married.When India was 18 months old the couple confirmed they were pregnant again with what would turn out to be twin boys Tristan and Sasha.By 2015 the family moved to Hemsworth’s native Australia and that same year he would be named sexiest man alive, which Pataky had a sly response to.She told Women’s Health UK: “Of course I think he’s beautiful and fit, but I will never tell him that because he will get too cocky.” The iconic couple have proved their love, and comedy chops, time and time again, like in 2016 when Australian tabloids reported issues in their marriage.Hemsworth hilariously tweeted: “Looking for a new wife according to @womensdayaus and other misleading outlets! Honey, you still love me right? #thanksfortheheadsup".Now, 11 years after they tied the knot, Pataky has put her career on hold to care for their three children in Australia.The family moved down under after life in Hollywood became a bit too overwhelming, with Hemsworth now reporting he loves not having the industry near his family.
