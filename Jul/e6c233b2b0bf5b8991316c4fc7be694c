Amanda Holden, 51, was busy keeping her fans updated over the weekend as she enjoyed her well-earned Italian break away. The Britain's Got Talent judge shared a snap to her story in view of her 1.8 million Instagram followers showing off her toned midriff. The ageless beauty looked amazing in the skintight white crop top and black overalls. Amanda also posted a picture with her lookalike daughters, Lexi, 16, and Hollie, 10, as they looked out to the Italian sunset. The Heart Radio presenter was flooded with comments as fans were in awe over the lookalike family. Nilamholmes said: "Those beautiful genes." Itsamy.xo added: "Absolute beauties.
