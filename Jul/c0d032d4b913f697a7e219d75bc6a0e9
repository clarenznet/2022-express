Doctor Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said: "We are planning for an influenza wave. "I don’t know if people are following Australia, but we are watching very, very carefully. "They have had their worst influenza season for more than five years. It started earlier and it rose very, very fast in all age groups, so we are expecting that we will see an early influenza wave. "While we normally don’t see influenza really kick off until the end of November to December, that might happen as early as late September-October - that’s what we’re planning for."  The expert warned a Covid wave is also expected around the same period, meaning the surge in both viruses could correlate. The Zoe symptom tracker app recently warned Covid cases were up 27 percent in just one week. These cases are expected to continue growing over the next months, alongside rising monkeypox cases, which are climbing in numbers of 20 to 40 per day. The monkeypox tally recently exceeded 1,000 cases, according to official data, and London is at the epicentre of the outbreak.
