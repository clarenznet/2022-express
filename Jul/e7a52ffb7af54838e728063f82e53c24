Ranvir Singh, 44, stunned in white as she posed alongside her boyfriend Louis Church, 26, and son Tushaan, 10, at Ascot's King George Diamond Day. The Good Morning Britain presenter was the picture of elegance in the white dress which featured a belt to draw in her curves. She paired the dress with white heels and a wide brimmed fascinator. Meanwhile, Louis looked dapper in blue, matching Ranvir's son's blue checked shirt. Ranvir and Louis first met when he worked as a production secretary on last year's Strictly, in which she competed with Giovanni Pernice. Tushaan is Ranvir's only child from her marriage to Ranjeet Singh Dehal, who she split from in 2020
