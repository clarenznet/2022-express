Davina McCall, 54, flaunted her athletic figure as she posed in a leopard print bikini for her 1.5 million followers, while sun umbrellas were visible in the background. The bubbly presenter admitted that she had spent "hours" on creating an outfits reel for her followers, before joking that she'd "lost the will to live". However any technical struggles weren't obvious from her photos, in which she looked the picture of wellness and elegance. She later switched to a maxi dress in the same leopard print pattern, plus a white linen outfit which she paired with a straw hat. Davina, who recently grieved the loss of her Alzheimer's sufferer father, seemed to be taking the opportunity to rest, heal and recuperate on her idyllic Turkish getaway. The fitness expert indulged in paddleboarding, yoga and a cookery class, plus, as the photos demonstrate, she even visited a traditional hammam.
