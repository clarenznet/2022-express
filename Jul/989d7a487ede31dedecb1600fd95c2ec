Billie Piper, 39, has wowed her fans as she posted some stunning selfies debuting her hair transformation. The star has long been known for her bleach blonde locks, but has recently gone over to the dark side. Flaunting her edgy, choppy new style and black colour, I Hate Suzie star Billie joked that she’d had an “emo glow up”. Her followers couldn’t believe their eyes, with one commenting: “Billie Piper has black hair omg I’ve never seen her like this before.” Another added: “Love how Billie Piper has dyed her hair so dark nobody recognises her now.” “Love it! Used to be blonde forever, recently went dark. Great experience Billie,” wrote a third.
