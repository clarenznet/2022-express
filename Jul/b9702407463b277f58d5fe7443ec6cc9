Strictly's Nadiya Bychkova and Kai Widdrington looked more loved-up than ever as they stepped out in London yesterday. The stunning couple attended Jean Paul Gaultier's Fashion Freak Show in Camden and couldn't keep their hands off each other as they attended the event. Nadiya, 32, dazzled in a sequined, gold mini dress which showcased her enviably toned legs. Her Strictly partner Kai, 26, looked dapper in a white suit with a matching t-shirt, and black sunglasses and belt. Documenting their night out on Instagram, Nadiya told her 138,000 followers: "Love last night, what an incredible show," alongside a heart emoji.
