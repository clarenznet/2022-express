Stacey Solomon, 32, felt a little foolish today as she travelled to her hen do with some of her closest pals. The mum-of-four jetted off on her first holiday since the pandemic began, ahead of her tying the knot with fiance Joe Swash, 40, later this month. Stacey has already been on one hen do, as she went on a staycation with her sister Jemma last year. But she was pregnant with baby Rose at the time, and so couldn’t drink. This year, Stacey and her friends went all out as they forced the singer to wear an enormous green pickle outfit, while the other women wore masks of Joe’s face.
