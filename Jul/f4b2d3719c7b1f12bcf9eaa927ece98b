Bella Hadid chose to go braless last night as she stepped out in New York City in a sheer top. The 25-year-old supermodel opted for a sheer tube top embellished with a floral pattern. She paired the daring top, which put her toned midriff on display, with some wide-legged jeans. Bella completed the Y2K-inspired look with a black bandana and small dark sunglasses, as well as a large canvas bag.
