Mr Javid said he could not continue in his post “in good conscience” after losing confidence in Boris Johnson’s leadership. This follows the revelation Mr Johnson admitted he was aware of a misconduct complaint against former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was suspended from the party following allegations of sexual misconduct last week.  But Mr Javid’s replacement has been named as Steve Barclay, who was acting as the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and chief of staff for Downing Street. Mr Sunak's replacement has been named as Nadhim Zahawi, who had been noted for his silence as the resignations rolled in. Mr Zahawi previously served as Education Secretary, following his promotion from minister for vaccines. Announcing his resignation, Mr Sunak said the country expected “Government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously”. Michelle Donelan has also been named Education Secretary, stepping into Nadhim Zahawi's former role. Ms Donelan, the MP for Chippenham, previously occupied the post of Universities Minister.
