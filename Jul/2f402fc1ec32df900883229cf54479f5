That 1995 interview, by then-BBC journalist Martin Bashir, made global headlines after Diana spoke openly about her mental health struggles and split from Prince Charles, saying: "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." Last year, a report by Lord Dyson concluded the BBC had covered up "deceitful behaviour" by Bashir to secure the bombshell interview. Writers working on Netflix's popular royal drama noted the new developments and incorporated them into the upcoming series, in light of the chat's "pivotal" place in the era the episodes cover. The series, which is out in November, stars Dominic West as Charles and Elizabeth Debicki as Diana, as well as Imelda Staunton as the Queen.
