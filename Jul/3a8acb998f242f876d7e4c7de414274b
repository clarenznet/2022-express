Dover and Folkestone have been plagued by traffic chaos over the weekend, with more than 72,000 vehicles being processed over the weekend. Highways England is warning of "severe delays," while drivers are reporting average speeds of just 5mph in some places. François Decoster, vice president of the Haute-de-France region, which includes Calais, said the UK had gone back 30 years because of Brexit and suggested the UK should ask the EU to let them join its Schengen zone - the arrangement that allows free movement of people on the continent. He said: "Brexit means we must do new controls. I have felt very sorry for the families, we like to welcome British tourists and we want them to come easily to our beautiful places. We have a few non-EU members who are members of Schengen, why don't we explore such an idea?" But Brexit has not been accepted as the cause of the problem by all. Responding to a comment piece that suggested Brexit was to blame, Richard James, a security expert, said: "Brexit does mean more border controls. Infrastructure is in place but the French are simply not providing the border control police to meet the deal that they signed. Cabins left unmanned. The fault lies entirely with France.⁩" Fernand Gontier, 62, director general of France’s PAF Border Police, has been accused of being responsible for there not being enough French officers in Dover port to process checks on Friday which resulted in days of chaos. Families faced 30-hour queues while as few as four of 12 French border passport booths were opened at one time. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
