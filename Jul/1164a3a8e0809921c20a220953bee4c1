Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has made it clear that he wants to keep Armando Broja amid strong interest from West Ham. Broja impressed last season on loan at Southampton as he scored nine goals in all competitions.  He has since returned to his parent club but faces a tough battle to break into Chelsea's first-team squad. While Romelu Lukaku has left to join Inter Milan back on loan, Tuchel still has Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi to choose from in the attacking positions. Reports have indicated in recent weeks that Broja indicated to Chelsea that he wanted a permanent move away from Stamford Bridge this summer in a bid for regular game time. The 20-year-old has spent the last two seasons out loan, playing for Vitesse Arnhem in the 2020/21 campaign before joining Southampton. West Ham have shown the most interest in signing Broja on a permanent basis and have lodged two offers to Chelsea. The first bid worth £25m was rejected by Chelsea but West Ham returned earlier this week with an improved offer worth £30m.  It's been suggested that personal terms won't be a problem for the Hammers and a deal could be close. But Tuchel has now poured cold water on Broja's imminent exit to east London, stating he wants to keep the Albania international. "I don't expect Armando to leave," Tuchel said. "We are aware of offers and interest. DON'T MISS  "We will take this decision together with the owner and the player. When he was here I was aware that he was trying to impress and become a Chelsea player as soon as possible." Tuchel was speaking ahead of Chelsea's upcoming friendly against Charlotte FC, which kicks off at 7.30pm ET tomorrow (12.30am BST Thursday 21 July). And the Chelsea boss has confirmed that new signing Raheem Sterling will make his unofficial debut at some point during the game. "Raheem is ready to go and will be on the pitch tomorrow," Tuchel said. "He is happy and excited to play his first match."
