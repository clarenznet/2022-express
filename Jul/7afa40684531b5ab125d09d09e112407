Cocaine user James Gill, 39, fractured the skull of grandfather Neil Robinson after accusing him of "walking on the wrong side of the road" in December last year. Nottingham Crown Court heard the victim died six days after being pushed over by Gill, who had punched two police officers five days earlier. Gill, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, then stole vodka and threw a bottle out of his car. When a motorist told him off, he allegedly said: "I know littering is wrong but so is arson... I am more than happy to set fire to your car." A 68-year-old man was then dragged out of his car and punched. Gill admitted manslaughter, four counts of assaulting an emergency worker, ABH, drink-driving, criminal damage, two shoplifting offences and making off without payment.
