The mother-of-one, 37, posted a glamour shot from her modelling heyday in view of her 1.8 million followers, comparing how she appears on social media to real life. In the pic, Gemma sported wet hair which had been styled across her face. She wore a glamorous smokey eye and smouldered as she ran her hand through her hair while the snap was taken. Gemma took to the caption to poke fun at herself, writing: "How I sweat on Instagram VS how I sweat at homeâ€¦" The short clip showed a sweaty Gemma walking outside as she squinted and could be heard muttering, "f*****g hell", as she endured the scorching temperatures.
