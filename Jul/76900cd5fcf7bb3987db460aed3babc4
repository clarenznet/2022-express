But those heading through 83 Redchurch Street Shoreditch, in London’s trendy east end, were offered some respite thanks to a six-metre wide billboard, designed by White Claw Hard Seltzer, to offer passers-by the ultimate mid-journey refresh. The temporary structure, which will be in place for two weeks, has been coated with heat-proof paint – described as frost-fuelled – and covered with specially designed cooling mats with touch-activated gel centres, that work by absorbing the body heat of people interacting with the board. Passers-by are able to chill out by placing a palm – or other key hot spots, such as their forehead or the inside of their wrists – on the cool-to-the-touch wall. The board also features a thermometer to keep people up-to-date on the record breaking temperatures, with street-style graphics allowing it to stand out from its urban surroundings. Michael Dean, spokesman for White Claw, said: “With record breaking temperatures, we wanted to give Londoners a much-needed moment of light refreshment on this scorching day. “What better way to cool them down than with a White Claw in hand, and a billboard that will absorb all body heat.”
