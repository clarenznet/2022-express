Pixie Lott, 31, looked fabulous in a colourful festival outfit as she attended Flackstock festival. The event was put together for Caroline Flackâ€™s friends and family to celebrate her life following her tragic death on February 15, 2020. In pictures of the evening, Pixie could be seen posing next to Strictly Come Dancing professional Aljaz Skorjanec. The pair were all smiles, with Pixie donning a fun mini dress featuring a collaret and black leather high-heeled boots.
