Heidi Klum, 49, and her husband Tom Kaulitz, 32, enjoyed a date night on Saturday evening as the model took the opportunity to share some sultry snaps. The America's Got Talent judge wrote "Date Night" followed by a devil and then a heart emoji. In one photo, Heidi could be seen sitting with her husband as he placed his hands on her legs. The Making The Cut host set pulses racing in a sexy peach mini-skirt and halter top combination with a 70s vibe. She flashed her taut abs and toned legs in the tight-fitted outfit which she teamed with heels. Heid's long blonde hair was styled in loose waves as she curled up next to her husband.
