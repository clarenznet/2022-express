Chelsey McDonald, 30, tested almost twice the alcohol limit when police stopped her moments after she got out of her orange BMW 218 convertible to go to a bar with friends. But the mum of two told Sefton Magistrates' Court she was sober at the wheel - and that after parking up she and two friends poured capfuls of vodka into their eyes in the belief they would "get drunk faster". She said: "One of the girls said, 'Shall we put it in our eyeball'. "Apparently, it gets you drunk a lot faster than it does downing it. I was just excited, I could not wait to get out, park the car and have a drink." Prosecutors condemned the beautician's defence as "ridiculous" and magistrates convicted her of drink driving and assaulting an officer. The court heard that a half-full 350cl bottle of vodka was found in McDonald's bag and she was stopped while "doing a little dance" and stumbling and hugging a friend as they entered a pub in the village of West Derby on Merseyside. Magistrate Christina Hill told her: "We believe it is implausible that alcohol level could be attained by drinking in the car park in the manner you said." But Keith Webster, defending, said: "The concept of putting vodka in your eyes is so left field - it is not something somebody would say if not true." The court heard an onlooker called police with concerns about McDonald's driving at 9pm last November 13. She told magistrates she had two bottles of WKD earlier in the evening but felt "absolutely fine". But a breath test showed she had 63 micrograms of alcohol. The legal limit is 35mcg. Police bodycam footage showed McDonald saying, "I am so drunk" before kicking a PC in the chest. She was banned from driving for 18 months, sentenced to a 12-week 7pm to 7am curfew and ordered to pay Â£395.
