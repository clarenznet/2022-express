Eden (Belle Dingle) has been firm friends with her co-star Isabel since she joined as a teen, taking on the role of Victoria Sugden back in 2006. The pair are believed to be inseparable when they get together outside the studio, and Isabel appeared to confirm that when she used a heart emoji to describe her co-star as "my love". Isabel and Eden tucked into tasty smoked salmon dishes while they caught up on each other's lives. When Isabel lost her dog recently after almost 12 years of "unconditional love", she shared on Instagram that her heart was "broken". However her pal was quick to offer support as she paid tribute to her darling dog, posting love heart emojis on her feed. It looks as if their close friendship is continuing to go from strength to strength - and perhaps the way to their hearts is through their stomachs, as this dining session together demonstrates.
