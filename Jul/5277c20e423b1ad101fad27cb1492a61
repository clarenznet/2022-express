Strictly star Janette Manrara, 38, took to the stage at Flackstock, a festival organised in the memory of Love Island host Caroline Flack following her death in 2020. The event, which took place at Englefield House in Reading, featured a host of the late star's celebrity supporters. Janette looked sensational as she paired a bright red Hollister skirt with a tropical floral print with a barely there bralet in a matching shade of fire engine red. The toned star had also flung on a cropped blue denim jacket to complete her attention-grabbing look. Janette's husband, fellow Strictly dance pro Aljaz Skorjanec, also took to the stage with her at one point and joined her in livening up the crowd.
