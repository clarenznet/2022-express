It was first made in 1932 at Slough, Berkshire, eventually turning out three million bars a day, after being created by US businessman Forrest Mars Sr. The chocolate-covered caramel and nougat bar gained the slogan "A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play". In wartime, the Slough factory kept up production - with the aim to get one in every soldier's knapsack. Spin-offs in later years have included a drink and an ice cream. Kerry Cavanaugh, at Mars Wrigley UK, said: "It's exciting to look back at our chocolate history". Meanwhile, a Mars poll of 2,000 adults found we each eat almost 10,000 choc bars in a lifetime.
