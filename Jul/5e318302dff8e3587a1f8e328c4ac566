Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to resign later today (Thursday, July 7), several media outlets have reported. His premiership was rocked by dozens of resignations in recent hours, but Mr Johnson remained defiant that he would hang on to his job. A No 10 source told the PA that after conversations with Sir Graham, Mr Johnson has agreed to stand down and a new Conservative leader will be in place by the time the party conference rolls around in October. Pressure has mounted on the PM to leave Downing Street, and the newly-appointed Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi tweeted this morning: "This is not sustainable and it will only get worse: for you, for the Conservative Party and most importantly of all the country. You must do the right thing and go now." Earlier this week, Mr Johnson received resignations from his Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his Health Secretary Sajid Javid, the latter of whom said "enough is enough" in a personal statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The resignations of two of Mr Johnson's most high-profile ministers sparked a wave of exits that have engulfed No 10, and several ministers have publicly called for the Prime Minister to resign. Conservative MPs are now likely preparing for a leadership battle, and names floated as possible contenders for the top job include Penny Mordaunt, Ben Wallace, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid, among others. Attorney General Suella Braverman has said she will stand in a contest to replace Mr Johnson as PM.
