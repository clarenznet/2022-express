The Spencer Tiara has been in the Spencer family for generations, but perhaps its most famous outing was at the 1981 wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and future King, Prince Charles. She turned to it time and again as a member of the Royal Family and, in the future, it's widely expected it will be worn by Diana's elder granddaughter, Princess Charlotte.
