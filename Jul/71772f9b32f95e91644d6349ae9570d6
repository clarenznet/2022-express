Dame Deborah James died aged just 40 last month after a battle with bowel cancer, which she bravely documented on her You, Me and the Big C podcast. Deborahâ€™s son Hugo, husband Sebastien Bowen, and daughter Eloise, could be seen in pictures with family behind the hearse today as it arrived at St Mary's Church in Barnes, West London. ITV star Lorraine Kelly was among the well-known faces who attended the funeral service. Presenter Gaby Roslin and Strictly Come Dancing star and musician Tom Fletcher were also in attendance.
