Sofia Vergara, 50, showcased her ageless beauty with a stunning throwback snap of herself wearing a skimpy green bikini. The actress looked incredible in the makeup-free photograph as she appeared beach-ready with her brunette hair left in natural waves. She captioned the picture: “Summer #tb.” And was inundated with comments from her astonished fans. Jimena stated: “You are the most beautiful in the world.” While Brian gushed: “Can’t tell if the pic is from when you were 20 or today. Please advise. I’m saying today Ms. Fountain of Youth.” And an unnamed user added: “Smoking hot #1.”
