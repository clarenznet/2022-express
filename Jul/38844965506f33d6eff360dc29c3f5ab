Police were called by the ambulance service shortly before 12.45pm after an ambulance had been signalled to stop by a vehicle carrying a seriously injured child on Rochdale Old Road, in Bury, Lancashire. Officers attended and the boy was tragically pronounced dead by paramedics before he could be taken to hospital. Enquiries quickly established that the boy had suffered his critical injuries following a collision with a tractor on farmland off Bentley Hall Road. The driver of the tractor is assisting us with our enquiries and a scene remains in place at the farm while investigators from Bury CID work to establish the circumstances alongside colleagues from the Health and Safety Executive. A scene was in place on Rochdale Old Road to allow for initial enquiries to take place. The cordon has now been lifted. Specialist officers are supporting the family of the boy, and we ask that their privacy is respected at this devastating time. Chief Inspector Ian Partington, of GMP’s Bury district, said: “This is a heart-breaking incident that has seen a young boy tragically lose his life and my thoughts go out to his family and loved ones who will be utterly devastated by today’s events. “Despite his family flagging down an ambulance while driving him towards hospital quickly as they could, the boy sadly could not be saved after the best efforts of paramedics; I can’t imagine how distressing this was for those involved. “We are working to ensure that a full investigation is carried out, and the farmland where we understand this incident to have occurred remains cordoned off to allow our investigators and partners from the HSE to conduct thorough enquiries to establish exactly what has occurred here.”
