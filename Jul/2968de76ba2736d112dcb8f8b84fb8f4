Brandon Lewis, who was Boris Johnson’s Northern Ireland Secretary until he eventually resigned his post days before Mr Johnson was forced out, made his remarks as he endorsed former Chancellor Mr Sunak’s rival for the Tory leadership, Liz Truss He also took a swipe at the Treasury, suggesting it was overly preoccupied with the reaction in Brussels, rather than with what was best for Britain. The Protocol is a mechanism agreed by both sides which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - but critics can it has instead imposed a border down the Irish Sea, much to the anger of the Unionist community. Speaking at a hustings event in Leeds, Mr Sunak indicated he would support the Northern Ireland Bill - but Mr Lewis said it had not always been the case. Mr Lewis told the Telegraph that attempts to craft legislation to override some sections of the protocol last year had “met with huge resistance” from the Treasury. He added: “The Treasury in my experience seems to want to try and keep the EU happy, when I’ve always felt our focus should be on working to deliver for the people of the United Kingdom and do what’s right by them as their sovereign government. “The concern has always been around, for the Treasury, ‘what will be the EU’s reaction’, rather than ‘how do we get this to work, and how do we fix this problem that is a problem for the UK?’” THIS IS A LIVE BLOG - SCROLL DOWN FOR REGULAR UPDATES
