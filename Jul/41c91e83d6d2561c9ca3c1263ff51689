Nick Kyrgios can book a place in the Wimbledon quarter-final today if he can defeat America's Brandon Nakashima. The Australian star has been the talk of the town over the last week, having grabbed the headlines with his flamboyant style of tennis and intense on-court meltdowns. Kyrgios dumped out the No 4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a thrilling and fiery match last time out, with both players receiving fines for their part in the drama. The 27-year-old could potentially set up an all-Australian affair with Alex de Minaur in the quarter-final if they both win their round of 16 matches, but Kyrgios insists he has a big job on is hands first. When asked if he was excited about possibly facing his compatriot, he said: "Of course. We've both got a tough match ahead. He's got Garin and I have Nakashima. Nakashima won easily today in straight sets. To do that at Wimbledon on grass is not easy. He's obviously playing well. I'm not looking past that."
