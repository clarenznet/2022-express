Adele, 34, kept it casual as she rocked a multicolouredÂ floor-length cover-up dress as she boarded a boat with her boyfriend Rich Paul. The couple has been soaking up the sun in Sardinia, Italy in a romantic getaway. The singer sported a sombre expression as she was pictured on the boat but was also seen laughing and giggling alongside her beau. The Someone Like You hitmaker teamed her look with a pair of large sunglassses as she kept her tresses bone straight.
