Susanna Reid, 57, put on a stylish display as she attended this evening's TRIC Awards. The Good Morning Britain presenter wore a simple white blazer dress with matching heels. The dress complemented Susanna's svelte figure with a buttoned-up design, as she styled her tresses in a loose wave. Others at the event included Kate Garraway, Holly Willoughby, and Phillip Schofield. Susanna's co-star Kate's attendance comes as she announced that her husband, Derek Draper, was back in hospital. Derek contracted coronavirus in March 2020 and spent more than a year in hospital, and Kate has been supported by Susanna and the GMB team ever since.
