Katie Boulter's Wimbledon dream came to a crashing end on Court 2 in her third round match against Harmony Tan. The Brit was the talk of Wimbledon following her epic comeback win over Karolina Pliskova in the second round.  That saw her reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time in her career, setting up a match against Serena Williams' conqueror Tan. The French tennis ace was also competing in the third round of Wimbledon for the first time, with the winner going on to potentially face Coco Gauff. There was a surprise at the scheduling of the match with Boulter not put on Court One or Centre Court and the stands were more than half empty at the start of her match against Tan. Not having the stands packed may well have affected Boulter, but Tan just dominated from the off with the Brit far from her best. The first set was wrapped up in just 24 minutes with the crowd who were in place stunned. And the second followed in a similar fashion with Boulter winning just seven of 36 receiving points. Tan wrapped up the win in less than an hour with Boulter shrugging as she walked out of the tournament.  FOLLOW ALL THE ACTION WITH BOULTER AND TAN ON COURT 2 BELOW
