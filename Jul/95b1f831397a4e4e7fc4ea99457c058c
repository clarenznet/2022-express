In comparison, this rises to more than half for every other age group, and 60 percent of those aged 55 and over. But only one in five adults (20 percent) are aware that ditching sunglasses in bright weather could lead to future eye problems – with this figure dropping to 18 percent among young adults. And with temperatures set to soar to 38 degrees C next week, Brits are being urged to make sure they take the necessary precautions to keep themselves safe. Pete Osborne, chief operations officer at Guide Dogs, which commissioned the research, said: "With an estimated six million people in the UK living with sight-threatening eye conditions, looking after your eyes is so important. "We recommend people prioritise their eye health and get into good habits – such as wearing sunglasses, booking regular eye tests, not sleeping in contact lenses or make-up, and not using out-of-date make-up." The study also found that, worryingly, nearly one in ten adults (eight percent) have never had an eye test. And a quarter haven't had one in more than three years – well over the two years recommended by experts. But nine percent weren't aware sight loss could be preventable, so weren't taking steps to minimise their risk of visual impairment – with half mistakenly believing sight loss is a natural part of ageing. Pete Osborne added: "Importantly, if you are worried about your eyes, speak to an expert. "If conditions are spotted and treated earlier, the risk of sight loss can be lowered – so don’t ignore any eye pain, discomfort, changes in vision, or other problems."
