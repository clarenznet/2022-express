Kate Middleton and Prince William often use social media to post videos and stories to their followers. However, the Royal couple only rely on one handy device to make their videos crystal clear quality. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge love sharing parts of their family life through posting videos on Instagram. David Watkins, who’s Digital Communications and Social Media for the couple, is the videographer behind the stunning videos and he was previously digital communications head for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s Instagram account. Despite the duo sharing videos with excellent quality, the device that David uses is actually very simple and easy for followers to buy to recreate at home. He was photographed by press cameras filming the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge using a gimbal device and now fans can get one on Amazon. Available now, royal fans can buy the Hohem Gimbal Stabiliser to make their videos as smooth as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Compatible with iOS and Android, a gimbal helps stabilise your phone while filming avoiding shaky hand and prevents blurring. All shoppers need to do is simply snap their phone into the stick and start filming. Plus, you can also utilise the gimbal’s professional shooting functions including face and object tracking, 360-degree panning, slow motion filming and more.
