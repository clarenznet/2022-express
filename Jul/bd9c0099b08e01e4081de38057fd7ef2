Jane Seymour has taken to Instagram to share a stunning snap of herself with her two lookalike sisters, Sally and Anne. The Hollywood star, 71, sparked a frenzy among her 251,000 followers with the picture where the three of the women showcased their ageless looks. Jane captioned the pic: "Side by side or miles apart, sisters will always be connected by heart. "Enjoying some delicious Chinese food together!" she added with a heart and smiling emoji. Jane sat in the middle of her two sisters and grinned from ear to ear while wearing a brightly coloured, one shouldered dress.
