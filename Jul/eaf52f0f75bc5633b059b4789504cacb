Declan Donnelly has broken his silence following the death of his brother, Dermott, aged 55 following a serious illness. Dec wrote via the Ant and Dec official Twitter account: “I am heartbroken to tell you that my darling brother Fr Dermott, @TweeterPriest, sadly passed away this afternoon. "We are all beyond devastated. Thank you for your messages of sympathy and support, they are appreciated. DD."      Dermott started out as a curate in Chester-le-Street and took Holy Orders in 1992. He was also asked by the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle to set up a youth outreach programme aimed at introducing disadvantaged young people to the Catholic Church. In 2015, he officiated Dec’s wedding to Ali Astall, with Ant as best man.
