When your voices had been taken for granted for so long by Labour and the political establishment, the Conservative Party promised to put you and your priorities first again. Since then our plans have been knocked off course - but I intend to correct that. I am putting myself forward for Conservative Party leader first and foremost to tell the truth. For too long politicians have focused on telling people what they want to hear, rather than being straight with people. I am here to be honest with you. This is a great country with a great people, but we face some grave challenges. The cost of living is soaring, our economy is imbalanced, and our culture and values are under threat. But I am an engineer and a problem-solver. I have the courage, conviction and clarity of thought to fix these problems. This means fixing government so it is working in your favour. The vote for Brexit, and your vote for us in 2019, sent a clear message to the heart of Whitehall. People are tired of the same old consensus that more and more government is the answer to our problems, that as long as we are making good headlines today, tomorrowâ€™s prosperity can wait. No more. I am the candidate to bring about the change and renewal we need. I understand the problems we are facing, and how we can fix them. I have a track record of getting things done in government - so you can trust me to be straight with you, and trust me to deliver. I am in this race to win it. I have a bold, fresh vision for our country. I know we can do better, and I will continue to make that case.
