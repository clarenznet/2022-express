Annie Baynes, from Burnham-on-Sea, developed severe leg pain on Wednesday afternoon and had to lean on a table for support throughout the night while her daughters made multiple 999 calls. Distressed Annie was eventually taken to hospital in Weston-Super-Mare on Thursday morning, where doctors diagnosed her with severe osteoporosis. Her daughter Elaine Kent said while hospital staff had been "fantastic", "something has to be done" about the lack of ambulances. South Western Ambulance Service admitted the system had come under "sustained pressure" on the night.
