He was the only son of housewife Dolores Therese and business executive father Joe, and is of German, English and Irish descent.

At its peak it was watched weekly by over one billion people in 140 countries and ran for 11 years until the finale in 2001. He served as a judge on America's Got Talent from 2006 to 2009 and in 2011 joined the Britain's Got Talent judging panel, as the additional fourth judge.
