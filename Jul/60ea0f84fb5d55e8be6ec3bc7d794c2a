Rafael Nadal will continue his quest for a calendar grand slam when he faces American Taylor Fritz in their Wimbledon quarter-final clash on Wednesday. The Spaniard has already tasted victory in the Australian and French Opens this year to move clear of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer on a total of 22 major titles. If he overcomes the highly-rated Fritz, Nadal could take on Nick Kyrgios in what would be a blockbuster semi-final should the controversial Aussie see off Cristian Garin this afternoon. But speaking after his last-16 win over Botic van de Zandschlup, Nadal insisted Fritz would pose a tricky test. "He’s playing well, he’s having [an] amazing year winning first Masters 1000 - against me by the way in the final," he said on Centre Court. "So it will be tough match but we are in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon so what can I expect? "After all the things that happened [in the] last couple of months to be able to be in a quarter-final of Wimbledon after not being here for three years is amazing so very, very happy."
