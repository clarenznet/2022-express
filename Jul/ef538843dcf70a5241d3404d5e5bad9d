Tom Cruise, 60, was left unfazed by scathing comments Mickey Rourke had made about his career just hours prior, as he flashed his famous Hollywood grin while enjoying a meal in London’s Mayfair. The Mission: Impossible actor opted for a smart-casual look as he arrived at Scott's restaurant wearing a black shirt, which he tucked into dark jeans. The Hollywood star was spotted enjoying his dinner while in the company of Dame Donna Langley, who is the chair of Universal Pictures. The meal was likely a celebratory event, as the British film executive was made a dame at Windsor Castle yesterday, and had described the honour as “exceeding all expectations”. His outing comes after The Wrestler star Mickey, 69, didn't hold back as he spoke about Tom while featuring as a guest on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Monday. Mickey said: “The guy's [Tom] been doing the same effing part for 35 years. I got no respect for that.” His words came after Piers asked Mickey how he felt about Tom's latest movie Top Gun: Maverick being at the top of the box office charts. He said: “That doesn't mean s**t to me. I don't care about money and power, I care about when I watch Al Pacino work and Chris Walken and De Niro's early work and Richard Harris's work and Ray Winstone's work.”
