She wore striking terracotta sunglasses on her head to keep her hair out of her face. The round, vintage-style glasses perfectly complemented the colours on the dress and the colour of her belt. She opted for espadrille wedges on her feet with a vibrant orange feature. As for makeup, the natural beauty opted for a very minimal look. She wore a sweep of mascara and a touch of bronze eyeshadow. She also appears to have used some bronzer to emphasise her cheek bones. Lady Marina Windsor did not step out alone but was joined by Princess Michael of Kent. The 77-year-old wore a baby pink blazer, a large white and camel wide-brimmed hat, a statement white scarf and a chic pair of brown and gold sunglasses. She boasted a classic pink shiny lip, and wore light pink and diamond earrings.
