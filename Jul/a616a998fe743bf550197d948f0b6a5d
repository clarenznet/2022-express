An investigation by the TaxPayers’ Alliance highlighted that Qatar’s debt is more than £1.1billion despite the 2022 World Cup host having a gross domestic product per capita of more than £50,000, putting it among the richest in the world. The Alliance’s probe, based on government data, reveals the UK is overdue a total of £4,706,930,000. Of this, £4,644,760,000 is owed to UK Export Finance (UKEF) – a government arm that helps international trade – and £62,170,000 to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Qatar is top of the pile, owing £1.125billion to UKEF. At the same time it is believed to have spent more than £180billion on this year’s World Cup, making it the most expensive in history. Sudan owes £876million (£874.5m to the UKEF and £1.5m to the Foreign Office). Iraq owes £463.5million, all to UKEF. Meanwhile Iran, led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, owes £28.4m – even though earlier this year Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was repaying a historical debt of £400million owed to the Islamic republic, which dates to the sale of tanks to the Shah of Iran in the 1970s. North Korea, led by dictator Kim Jong-un, owes £5.86million to UKEF, although there is little indication as to why. TPA chief executive John O’Connell said: “Public services are under pressure and taxes are soaring to a 70-year high, yet the Exchequer is owed billions by the world’s despots and dictators, with information on individual loans only going back to July 2021.  “When taxpayers see there are almost £5billion in loans to foreign countries in arrears, they will be outraged.” Sir John Redwood, the Tory MP for Wokingham, said he was concerned by the revelation that Britain was owed money by North Korea and Iran. Speaking in general, he added: “These loans seem to be related to UK trade policy and export promotion. There are various insurance arrangements and premiums paid for the finance that need to be considered. I am not satisfied – we need to know more regarding, for example, Qatar, where we sell arms and buy gas.” Few details about the nature of the loans are provided, although UKEF data for sustainable lending between September 2020 and March 2021 reveals Britain is owed £23million by Ghana for a water filtration project and £31million by Iraq relating to a “power station maintenance and rehabilitation project”. A government spokesman said: “UKEF is a self-funding department that generates consistent returns for both UK taxpayers and businesses. “It supports billions of pounds worth of UK export activity every year and has returned over £2billion of profit to the Treasury since 1991.”
