Bernard Cribbins was last spotted filming Dr Who as he prepared to make his return to the popular BBC show. The actor was seen being pushed around in a wheelchair by his co-star David Tennant in May earlier this year. Catherine Tate was also in attendance as they filmed an action shot in Camden, London. Cribbins previously played Wilfred Mott in the BBC show. It comes as the actor's agent confirmed that the star had died at the age of 93.
