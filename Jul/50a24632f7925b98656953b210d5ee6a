Daisy Fenton, 20, described an account given by a senior investigator as "rubbish". According to the Greek official, Jack, 22, “rushed” back to the helicopter after disembarking despite warnings from ground staff to stay clear. It was even suggested he may have been trying to take a selfie when he was killed. But Daisy said: “This was Jack’s first ever helicopter ride. So you can imagine how cautious and wary, if anything, he was. “All the rest – of him running back on the tarmac and violating protocols – is rubbish. Why? Because there were no protocols. They were never told what to do and what not to.” Daisy, a student at the University of Manchester, was not on the flight and did not witness what was said or what happened. But she says she is being backed up by Jack’s friends, who were on the flight with him. Jack was killed on Monday night when he was struck by the aircraft’s rear rotor blade shortly after landing on the outskirts of Athens. The dispute over how it happened has added to the anguish of his family. Daisy said: “No one knows exactly what led him back. Perhaps he forgot something. “But the line that he went back to take a selfie is rubbish. It’s a lie.” Jack had joined friends for a holiday on the Greek island of Mykonos. It was initially thought that his parents Miguel and Victoria were with him – but they were at home in Tonbridge, Kent, at the time. Victoria described her son as a “wonderful boy”. He was educated at Sutton Valence School near Maidstone and at Oxford Brookes University. A second helicopter with the father of Jack’s friends on board was approaching the helipad when Jack was killed. It was diverted to Athens International Airport. The pilot of Jack’s helicopter and two members of the ground crew were arrested following the tragedy. They were later released without being charged.
