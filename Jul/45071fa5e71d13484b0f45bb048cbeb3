Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, 75, travelled to Cornwall with her husband Prince Charles on Monday. This came one day after the Duchess’ 75th birthday celebrations. The Prince of Wales is also known as the Duke of Cornwall in some parts of the country.  Today he is celebrating 70 years since becoming the Duke of Cornwall. On Monday, Charles and Camilla visited Mousehole, the home of Stargazy Pie. Then the couple went on to Newlyn. This week is known as Devon and Cornwall week for the Royal Family.  This is why Charles and Camilla are undertaking their annual tour of the region in raging temperatures here in the UK. The Duchess was therefore carrying her familiar white parasol to protect her from the heat. However, Charles walked around Cornwall with no concessions to the heat. Camilla kept her style cool today in the tropical-style weather.  She decided to opt for a beautiful pastel blue, fit and flare dress, that came complete with a collared neckline. The light material kept her cool whilst still looking glam. The Duchess added her favourite slingback tan heels from Sole Bliss, a company she always buys from due to suffering with bunions. Camilla also accessorised with a pair of leopard print Ray-ban sunglasses.
