Mercedes are cautiously optimistic they can challenge closer to the front at the British Grand Prix with the team bringing new updates to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell’s car. The Silver Arrows have claimed the smooth surface at Silverstone could play to their advantage after the team has fared better on purpose-built tracks this season. However, Hamilton's involvement in Sunday’s Grand Prix is still under threat as his war with the FIA over jewellery continues. The seven-time champion could be barred from the race if he defies the rule and wears jewellery in practice today. Max Verstappen arrives at Silverstone with a commanding 46-point advantage over Sergio Perez. However, it was this track 12 months ago where his title bid appeared to derail after a massive accident with Hamilton at Copse corner.
