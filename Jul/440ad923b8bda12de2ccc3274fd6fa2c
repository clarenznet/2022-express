Many domestic abuse victims must also suffer through civil and family proceedings involving their abuser, for example when making arrangements for children. For two decades, judges have had powers to stop defendants cross-examining vulnerable victims in criminal courts. But victims in the civil and family courts haven't had the same protection. And in some cases domestic abusers use proceedings to carry on tormenting their victims. The situation was even described as a "stain on the reputation of our family justice system" by one judge. We're determined to put an end to this - to protect victims, ease their trauma and make sure they get a fair hearing. Today, we are bringing in new protections to prevent parties cross-examining each other, in specific circumstances, in family and civil proceedings. Instead, courts will be able to appoint legal professionals to carry out cross-examination.  This is part of a package of measures that are designed to protect domestic abuse victims. Under the Domestic Abuse Act, we made clear domestic abuse isn't just physical violence - it can be emotional, coercive and controlling and economic abuse. And through the Domestic Abuse Plan we are investing heavily in tackling this crime - over £140million for victim support and over £81million for tackling perpetrators. These are important changes that will help to keep victims safe and support them to get the best outcomes from the justice system, so they aren't bullied into arrangements that are unfair and unjust.
