Lady Amelia Windsor, 26, is the granddaughter of Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, who is himself the Queen’s cousin. The young royal stepped out in Paris on Wednesday evening in a beautiful dress. Amelia attended the David Yurman Paris Flagship Grand Opening.  This event was placed at 245 Rue Saint Honore in Paris, France. For the event, Amelia wore a £160 multicoloured dress. The ‘Marla dress’ was from Sezane, which is also a brand favoured by Kate Middleton. The Duchess of Cambridge sported a pair of Sezane earrings earlier in the day at Windsor.  Amelia’s sleeveless knitted maxi dress featured ruffles on the shoulders and back. It also had a V-neckline in the front with a deep back. For footwear, the royal opted for the same brand. Amelia wore ‘Sienna clogs’ in the colour magenta.  They cost a whopping £165, making them pricier than the dress. These magenta heels feature three-inch wooden heels. They then have an ankle strap closure system with a buckle. Although the sole of the shoe is wooden, the lining and insole are made of leather.
