Helen Skelton, 38, made sure she didn't miss the fun as she attended the Great Yorkshire Show with her six-month-old baby. The Countryfile star looked amazing as she flashes her bra in a low-neckline crop top. Helen wore high waisted pink trousers, leaving her toned abs on full display. She accessorised with large black shades as she posed holding her young daughter, Elsie Kate. The mother-of-three shared the uplifting update to her 311,000 Instagram followers four months after she announced she was splitting from her husband of eight years, Richie Myler.
