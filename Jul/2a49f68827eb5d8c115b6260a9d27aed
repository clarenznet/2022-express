The Love Actually star, 46, donned a lime green swimsuit as she kicked back and relaxed by the pool while in Bodrum, Turkey. Martine put her toned pins on display as she posed up a storm poolside. The next snap showed the actress sitting on a perfectly made bed while holding a drink in one hand and the phone in another as she grinned from ear to ear while ordering cold drinks. The swimsuit perfectly hugged the contours of Martine's curvy body and showcased her amazing figure. Martine captioned the series of snaps: "The neon swimsuit… Part 1! Morning sunbathing for me … Already scorchio! More ice cold drinks are being ordered as we speak!"
