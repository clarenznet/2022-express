Jennifer Lopez, 52, flaunted her emblematic curves yesterday during an outing in Los Angeles. The Love Donâ€™t Cost A Thing singer looked incredibly chic in a casual outfit as she made her way into a dance studio. She opted for some skin-tight flared trousers that she paired with a long-sleeved crop top and some comfortable trainers. To complete the stylish look, JLo threw her long hair in a high bun and donned a pair of aviator style sunglasses.
