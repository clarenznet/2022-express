There are just under two weeks to go until the start of the new Premier League season, and all around the country clubs will be desperately scrambling to try and push for further additions to their squads. It has already been a busy summer, but things could well go up another gear between now and the end of August. One of the biggest sagas has been that of Sevilla defender Jules Kounde, who has been stuck in the middle of a transfer tug-of-war between Chelsea and Barcelona. Despite initial Blues confidence that they would land their man, the west Londoners have been rocked by recent reports coming out of Spain suggesting that Barca are now in the driving seat. And if they lose out, manager Thomas Tuchel is not likely to be happy at all. Meanwhile, Everton have only managed to bring in one signing so far in centre-back James Tarkowski from Burnley, and they made need to sell before they can buy. Dele Alli has hardly set the world alight since joining from Tottenham, and there are some suggestions that he could be off already. Where he may end up remains to be seen. And with the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Leeds all likely to make at least one more signing each before the close of the window, there is still plenty to keep your eyes out for in the coming days and weeks.
