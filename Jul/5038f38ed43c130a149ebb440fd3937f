The employee, who asked not to be named, blasted a council for an alleged lack of support during the heatwave and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, East Riding Council said refuse staff are allowed to wear shorts and are being supplied with sun cream. The authority also allowed staff to start one hour early today to cope with the record hot weather. But the employee told Hull Live: "We are expected to go round collecting refuse bins in these temperatures while there is still a lot of staff working from home. "We worked all through coronavirus with no support from the council." Temperatures rocketed to 34C yesterday in the Humberside region, and they're expected to exceed that figure today.  An East Riding Council spokesperson said: "We are mindful of our refuse staff and all our staff working outside during the hot weather, we urge them to take extra care, but obviously the job still has to be done." A bin worker in York turned up to work in a kilt in protest against the local council's ban on shorts last week. Lee Moran said having to wear heavy-duty trousers in the hot weather was "ridiculous" and City of York Council said it was reviewing its uniform policy. Ben Grabham, Head of Environmental Services at City of York Council, said last week: "We’re all experiencing hot weather at the moment so can sympathise with anyone working in the direct sun. "The health, safety and well-being of our staff is paramount. "The reason our waste collection crews wear trousers is to protect them against sharp objects that may be contained in recycling boxes or in bags. "We appreciate working outdoors at this moment is very warm and we're supporting our crews who are encouraged to take regular rest breaks and wear hats and sun cream that they are provided with."
