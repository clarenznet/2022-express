George Russell will line up at the front of the grid for today's Hungarian Grand Prix after securing his maiden pole position at the end of yesterday's qualifying session. The Mercedes driver, who is yet to win a race in F1, produced a stunning lap to pip the likes of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc in the dying seconds to ensure the best-placed starting position for this afternoon's 70-lap contest. Russell's qualifying result marked a first pole of the year for Mercedes, who have struggled to keep up with the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull over the course of the campaign to date. It was a different story for Lewis Hamilton, though, with the 37-year-old set to start from seventh on the grid after a DRS failure hampered his efforts at the end of Q3. Red Bull, meanwhile, will have plenty of work to do to climb up the order following their disastrous showing against the clock on Saturday afternoon. A power unit issue for Max VerstappenÂ saw him resigned to a 10th-placed grid slot, while Sergio Perez failed to make it out of Q2 and will be desperate to get himself back into contention for a welcome haul of points when the five red lights go out later today.
