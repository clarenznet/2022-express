In a keynote speech, breaking his silence on Britain’s future outside the European Union, Sir Keir pledged to “make Brexit work” and vowed not to try to join the Single Market or a customs union. His five-step plan includes sorting out the Northern Ireland Protocol; tearing down unnecessary trade barriers; supporting our world-leading services and sciences; keeping our nation safe, and investing in Britain. But his plan has met harsh criticism and grim realities this morning. Greek economist and politician Yanis Varoufakis said: "Keir Starmer just demonstrated how NOT to do politics: He pledged not to undo Brexit while failing spectacularly to come up with ANY plan (let alone a decent one) on how to make Brexit work. The epitome of the opportunist in search of a semblance of power." His comments come after shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry admitted Britain has to "make the most of what we have got" now that it is out of the European Union because rejoining on the same terms would not be an option. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: "If we wanted to rejoin, we would have to join the euro." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
