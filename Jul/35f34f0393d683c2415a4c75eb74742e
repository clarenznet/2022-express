We're less than two weeks from the start of the 2022-23 Premier League season and top-flight clubs are still going all out to sign transfer targets. Manchester United and Chelsea are among the busier teams in the market with the Frenkie de Jong and Jules Kounde sagas raging on.  United have an agreement in place with Barcelona for De Jong but the Catalan club's financial problems continue to delay a deal. While Chelsea look as though they may miss out on Sevilla defender Kounde, who Barca are keen to bring in despite their cash flow issues. Elsewhere, Manchester City want Brighton's Marc Cucurella but the likes of Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool are more focused on outgoings. Clubs like West Ham, Newcastle and Everton continue to make additions though in what promises to be a hectic few weeks before the new campaign gets underway.
