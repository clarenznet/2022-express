Baywatch star David Hasselhoff's 30-year-old daughter Hayley has been making a name for herself in the plus size modelling world, strutting her stuff on the catwalk for inclusive beachwear brand Capshe. Over the weekend she was seen walking to commemorate Miami Swim Week in the sunshine state of Florida. However she also shared some more personal snaps with fans from behind the scenes on Instagram, including one of her voluptuous cleavage seemingly spilling out from her chic black swimwear outfit. In another photo set shared with her 128,000 followers, she took mirror selfies in a patterned coverup while sporting pink tinted shades. Some may already know Hayley from her role in the reality TV show The Hasselhoffs, alongside 32-year-old sister Taylor. However, for those that don't, she is determined to make a name for herself in the plus-size category, and her Instagram snaps will help ensure fans remember her.
