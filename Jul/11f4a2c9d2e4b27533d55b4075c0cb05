Naomi Campbell, 52, was awarded the PHD title to recognise her special contribution to the fashion industry over the years. The visibly emotional supermodel was forced to wipe away a tear of emotion as it was formally announced that she can now use the letters 'Dr' in front of her name. A delighted Naomi showed up at London's Royal Festival Hall to join a crowd of graduating students from The University for the Creative Arts, where she received her doctorate. She dressed demurely in a beige Burberry jumpsuit with a long black university gown over the top of it. Outside afterwards, she threw her graduation hat into the air in a gesture of celebration, while fans praised that few others had achieved such a global impact on the fashion industry.
