The hip-hop radio host, who was with the Beeb for almost 20 years, stepped down from his Capital Xtra show in April after accusations by several women of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour. Westwood, 64, is alleged to have abused his position to take advantage of seven women. He denies all the allegations against him. Of the police referral, the BBC said after a Freedom of Information request: “This is an historic case. We are establishing the facts around it.”The corporation did not specify when the other five complaints were made. In April, BBC director-general Tim Davie said the claims were “shocking” but added he had seen “no evidence of complaints.”
