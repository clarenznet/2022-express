Jasmine Harman, 46, unveiled her toned arms and legs in celebration of the news. The presenter donned a floral mini dress featuring bright blue flowers and a pair of open-toe sandals with a flash of neon pink nail varnish. It looked like she was embracing the summer vibe to the max, as she promised her 106,000 Instagram followers three weeks of never before seen episodes of the Channel 4 show. The first episode kicks off with Jasmine connecting a couple who have "a Â£70k budget burning a hole in their pockets" with a host of exotic properties in the sunshine. The special edition screenings of A Place in the Sun will be airing on weekdays at 3pm on Channel 4.
