Queen Margrethe, 82, was accompanied by her younger sister Anne-Marie, 75, for a sweet royal reunion. Anne-Marie reigned as Greece's last Queen Consort between 1964 and 1973. However, despite acquiring the title through her marriage to Constantine II, it was snatched away from the Copenhagen-born royal following the result of Greece's republic referendum. The pair were also joined by Glucksburg's 78-year-old middle sibling Princess Benedikte of Denmark. All three of Benedikte's children, Gustav, 53, Alexandra, 51, and Nathalie, 47, were present at the event. Crown Prince Frederik, 54, and Prince Joachim, 53, were also in attendance. Family members descended on Graasten Palace after travelling from as far away as Greece, Germany and the United States. Four out of Anne-Marie's five children also made the trip. However, Crown Prince Pavlos, 55, was unable to attend. Writing about the reunion, the Danish Royal Family said: "During her lifetime, Queen Ingrid made a big mark on Graasten Castle, and these days, the former Queen's three daughters and grandchildren with spouses are gathered at the southern Jutland castle for a 'cousin' get-together. "The gathering has been arranged by Her Majesty The Queen, Her Royal Highness Princess Benedikte and Her Majesty Queen Anne-Marie, and thus almost all of Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid's grandchildren gathered just now during the summer holidays." The meeting was also warmly received on social media. It received more than 34,000 likes on Twitter and fans of the Danish Royal Family took to the comment section to share their thoughts.
