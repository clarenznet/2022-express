The Duke of Cambridge, 40, who became President of the Football Association in 2006, announced he will attend England Women's first major tournament final as they prepare to take on Germany on Sunday. The Lionesses roared into the Euro 2022 Final after mauling Sweden 4-0 at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in front of 28,624 people. Prince William congratulated England following their victory. He said: "The entire country is so proud of everything you're achieving. "We believe in you and will be with you all the way!" When Gareth Southgate's England side suffered penalty shootout heartache against Italy at Wembley last July, the Duke was joined by his wife Catherine, also 40, and the Cambridges' nine-year-old son Prince George.

However, the MailOnline has claimed Princess Charlotte, seven, could join her mother and father for the historic clash. William recently told the Lionesses his daughter was a keen footballer and particularly enjoyed playing in net. He told the team: "Charlotte wanted me to tell you that she’s really good in goal." The Duke previously predicted his son George would pull on the claret and blue strip of his beloved Birmingham-based club Aston Villa during an appearance on the That Peter Crouch Podcast. Prince William told the ex-Liverpool, Spurs and England striker: "I reckon he could be their all-time goal scorer. "I can see no reason why not." Germany, who have won the European Championship eight times, joined England in the final after captain Alexandra Popp, 31, scored a brace to see off France 2-1 at Stadium MK.
