  Jon will be hoping to win big at The Open this year, and his tight-knit family will be right behind him. The couple lived together for two years before they tied the knot in December 2019, at a ceremony in Bilbao, Spain, near Rahm's hometown of Barrika. Last year, Kelley gave birth to their first child - a boy named Kepa Cahill Rahm. Jon, Kelley, and their young son Kepa all live in Scottsdale, Arizona.
