Cheryl, 39, may have narrowly missed a wardrobe mishap as she performed at the Mighty Hoopla festival last year at Brockwell Park, London. The singer dazzled on stage in an extremely low-cut fuchsia jumpsuit with geometric cut-out patterns. In throwback pictures, Cheryl could be seen singing and dancing up a storm as her winged jumpsuit flew in the wind. The former Girls Aloud star completed her holographic festival look with a winged smokey eye and adorned her face with numerous rhinestones.
