Elena Rybakina caused something of an upset on Centre Court as she beat former Wimbledon champion Simona Halep 6-3 6-3 in their semi-final clash. The Kazakhstani-Russian was in fine form against her out-of-sorts opponent, and will now face Tunisian Ons Jabeur in the final at the weekend. Speaking on court after the win Rybakina said: "It was a great match. Simona is a great champion and we've had many tough matches before. I was really focused today and was very happy with my performance because I think I was solid. "I was nervous but I think the matches before helped on Court One. Today when the full crowd were cheering I was nervous but I'm very happy to win. "Today I was mentally prepared and I did everything I could. "It's going to be a great match against Jabeur. Her drop shots are tricky but I'm going to enjoy it and have fun on court." LOOK BACK ON HOW HALEP VS RYBAKINA DEVELOPED BELOW
