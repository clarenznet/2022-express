The Premier League summer transfer window is in full swings with done deals aplenty and rumours galore. There's an abundance of big stories in the transfer market with Cristiano Ronaldo wanting out of Manchester United, the Red Devils and Arsenal battling for Ajax's Lisandro Martinez and Chelsea and Tottenham looking to make multiple signings in the coming weeks. Title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool's business appears almost done. United announced Tyrell Malacia as their first summer signing on Tuesday from Feyenoord and they could soon confirm free agent Christian Eriksen as their second addition. Ajax defender Martinez and Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong are other major targets. Arsenal also want Martinez and could be on the hunt for another midfielder with Leicester's Youri Tielemans a prominent option and long-time target. Spurs have had a very impressive summer so far and are looking to close deals for Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet on loan and Middlesbrough full-back Djed Spence. While Man City want to add Brighton's Marc Cucurella to their squad after bringing in Erling Haaland and Kalvin Phillips. And Chelsea are hunting a whole load of additions including two new centre-backs - with Jules Kounde of Sevilla and Juventus' Matthijs de Ligt high on their list - and also forwards. Man City's Raheem Sterling could become a Chelsea player this week. You can keep up to date with all the latest goings on in the transfer window below with Express Sport.
