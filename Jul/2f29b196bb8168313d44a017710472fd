Kate Beckinsale looked radiant at the National Film Awards 2022 on Monday. The 48-year-old looked decades younger than her years in a stunning silver gown with a slit up the leg and a plunging neckline. The gown featured shoulder pads and long sleeves, and Kate accessorised with matching silver jewellery. She picked up the Best Actress gong for her role as Lindy Lewis in comedy-action-thriller Jolt, which came out last year. The film also stars Stanley Tucci and Laverne Cox.
