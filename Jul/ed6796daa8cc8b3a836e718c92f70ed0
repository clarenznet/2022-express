Tom Cruise is set to become a sexagenarian on 3 July, with the Top Gun star reaching his seventh decade of life but still looking years younger. Tom will turn 60 on 3 July, and he’s been reportedly planning two huge birthday bashes, including one in Chipping Norton’s Soho Farmhouse. Tom is said to have fallen in love with the private members’ club when his pal Simon Pegg hosted a party there. A source told The Sun: "In Britain the invite list will be a Who’s Who of his circle – they’ll be asking the likes of David Beckham, James Corden, his co-star Simon Pegg and obviously his partner Hayley Atwell will be there for both.” Tom doesn't look his years, but he’s not alone - let’s take a look at some celebrities who are 60 or will soon reach the milestone birthday, but you’d never think it.
