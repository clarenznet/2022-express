Hannah Waddingham, 47, almost spilled out of a very low-cut white dress as she attended Paris Fashion Week yesterday. The Ted Lasso actress appeared in great spirits as she stepped out of a car waving and smiling at fans before heading into the Elie Saab Couture Fall Winter 2022-2023 show. She donned a midi dress that put her ample cleavage on display and featured a floral embroidered lace trim. Hannah paired the ethereal dress with some pale pink stilettos and a matching shoulder bag, while keeping the look chic with a loose ponytail and a natural makeup palette.
