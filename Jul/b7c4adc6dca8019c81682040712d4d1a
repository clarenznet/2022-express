Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke is in mourning after his older brother, Garth, was found dead on Tuesday morning. The 54-year-old was found by his other brother, Clint, in Tobago. Police have said that Garth's body showed no signs of violence and there are fears that the father of one decided to take his own life. The body has been examined by the district medical officer and is now awaiting a formal autopsy. Garth was a social worker in Tobago. Although Garth's family did not wish to talk to the media, neighbours have said that his death has left the local community stunned, with some describing Yorke's brother as “quiet, helpful and jovial". One neighbour added: “You never really know what people are going through. The area’s shocked.” One senior police officer told Newsday, “It is always a sad time, and our sympathies go out to the Yorke family on behalf of the police service."
