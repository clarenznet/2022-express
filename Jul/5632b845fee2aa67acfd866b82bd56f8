The prediction for Sunday would break the record of 38.7C set in Cambridge in 2019. Rebekah Sherwin, of the Met Office, said: "From Sunday and into Monday, temperatures are likely to be in excess of 35C in the south east. Some models have been producing maximum temperatures in excess of 40C." The UK Health Security Agency said: "If it gets above 104F (40C), then it is likely to be a level-four heatwave for the first time." Hospitals and ambulance services are under huge pressure as the heatwave combines with Covid absences among staff. Network Rail is preparing speed limits to reduce the likelihood of tracks buckling while councils are delaying bin collections.  The RAC said: "If temperatures hit 40C, people should question their decision to drive." Wildfires are also a concern. Yesterday firefighters in Wiltshire continued to tackle a blaze on Salisbury Plain sparked by military exercises, while Dorset crews went to a solar farm at Verwood.
