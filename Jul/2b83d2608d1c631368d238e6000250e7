Strike action sponsored by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has rocked services across the UK. The two unions are helping workers reach a deal on pay and conditions with rail bosses, but at a cost to some commuters. The July 27 walkout is one of two closing out July, with others due in August as a "summer of discontent" not seen in 30 years takes shape. Today's strikes will likely ripple into July 28, causing continued delays on some trains ahead of a final push from rail crews on the weekend. The next strikes follow on Saturday, July 30, spearheaded by the ASLEF rather than RMT union. Those walkouts will interrupt people on several major railways, but fewer than the 15 expecting disruption today.

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said underground employees would stay off work on the day as the union continues to negotiate jobs and pensions. He said TfL had refused to share details of a draft Government proposal disclosing funding agreements for the capital's transport. TfL has until August 2 to meet the union's jobs, pensions and working conditions demands.
