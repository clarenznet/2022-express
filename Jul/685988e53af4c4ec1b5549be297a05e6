The Tory leadership race is fully underway with candidates pitching themselves to the public and MPs in an attempt to garner support before tonight’s deadline. Each contender needs the backing of 20 MPs according to the rules set by the 1922 Committee this week. But who is backing who in the race to become the next Prime Minister? A relative outsider in the race, the former levelling up and equalities minister has won the backing of Tory heavyweight Michael Gove and 15 others. With a little more support could find herself on the MPs ballot for Number 10.

Her pitch is failing to convince enough MPs however, and with a mere 12 backers, she’s unlikely to pass the initial voting round.

Unsurprisingly, this attempt is yet to convince any of his fellow MPs and he has no declared backers. The former Health Secretary is no stranger to Tory leadership bids, having gone up against Mr Johnson in the final round of the 2019 contest. His support has dwindled somewhat since then, with 14 public backers so far.
