The Duke of Sussex is suing the Home Office over a decision not to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family when in the UK. On Thursday, the lawsuit heard that the key Home Office committee that took the decision to remove Police Protection included the Queen's staff. Harry's lawyer revealed that he had faced "significant tensions" with a top aide to the Queen involved in downgrading his security. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had not been aware. Sir Edward Young, the Queen's private secretary, played a role, they claim. Harry is now considering a new lawsuit after the Palace didn't tell the Home Office he'd pay for police security. He is "engaged in pre-action correspondence for a proposed second judicial review claim in relation to these matters, and intends to issue that claim shortly," according to Newsweek Royal correspondent Jack Royston.
