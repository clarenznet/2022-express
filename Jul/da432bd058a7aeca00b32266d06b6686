Lady Hiroko Barclay, 79, says the former owner of the Telegraph Media Group, 87, was ordered to make two payments of Â£50million following the end of their 34-year marriage. Lady Hiroko told the High Court yesterday of Sir Frederick: "His aim is to string things out until one or other of us dies."  She said he has "the means to pay", adding: "For him to pretend otherwise is false." Sir Frederick contests the claim.He and his twin Sir David, who died last year, also owned The Ritz in London. The hearing continues.
