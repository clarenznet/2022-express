As it emerged in January, the Duke of Sussex is bringing legal action against the Home Office over its decision not to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family while in the UK. Prince Harry's lawyers are expected to ask Mr Justice Swift to grant permission for a full judicial review of the decision regarding his security. If today's application is successful, the Duke will be allowed to argue his case at the High Court. Prince Harry lost his taxpayers' funded police protection after he and Meghan Markle stepped down as full-time working royals in March 2020. A statement released by the Duke's office in January claimed Harry had offered in January 2020 to personally pay for the police protection needed for himself and his family but the offer was "dismissed". The Duke, whom the statement argued his security detail in the US can't offer the same level of protection when he is in the UK as they can't carry guns on British soil, has the goal "to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country." During a preliminary hearing in March, during which the judge ruled that parts of the court documents in the case should remain private, Robert Palmer QC, for the Home Office, said in written submissions Harry's offer to privately fund police protection was "irrelevant" and that personal protective security by the police is not available for hire. The hearing begins at 10.30am. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
