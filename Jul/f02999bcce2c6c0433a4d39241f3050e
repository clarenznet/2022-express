Former Manchester United and Rangers goalkeeper Andy Goram has died aged 58 after a short battle with cancer. He also enjoyed long stints at Oldham and Hibernian throughout his 23-year career and earned 43 caps for Scotland, making his debut under Sir Alex Ferguson. Goram announced he had oesophageal cancer in April after being told he had just six months to live. He revealed he had turned down chemotherapy, which would've only extended his life by three months, due to how his ex-wife Miriam reacted to the treatment last year. The Bury-born shot-stopper made 260 appearances for Rangers between 1991 and 1998 after enjoying lengthy spells at Oldham and Hibernian throughout the decade prior. On Saturday, Rangers took to social media with a statement to confirm the sad news of Goram's passing. It read: "Rangers Football Club are today deeply saddened to announce the death of our legendary goalkeeper, Andy Goram, following a short battle with cancer. The thoughts of the directors, management, players and staff are today with Andy's family and would ask that their privacy is respected at this sad time. Funeral details will be communicated in due course."
