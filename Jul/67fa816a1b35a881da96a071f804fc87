Laura and Philip Borrell helped swindle the authorities after her devious mother Frances Noble pretended she was in need of 24-hour help. A judge called the scam "possibly the largest fraud of its type to come before the English courts". The Borrells, both 45, lived a high life of luxury holidays, shopping sprees and expensive cars - all on benefits claimed by Noble. Between August 2005 and November 2018, she faked the extent of a brain disorder and claimed she needed round-the-clock care at the family home in Weston, Herts, St Albans Crown Court heard. Noble obtained £624,047 from Hertfordshire County Council - but less than £100,000 was spent on care. The Borrells accepted they received more than £200,000. The council is looking to claw the money back. Investigators were told how the supposedly bedridden Noble was seen being pushed around shops in a wheelchair.  On another occasion, she tucked into a meal in a restaurant when she was meant to be on a liquid diet only. She was also seen collecting grocery deliveries at the front door. In 2019, the family moved to Berlin, but the Borrells returned to face the music. Noble, 66, remains in Germany. Last month, sha an adm repre she was jailed in her absence for four years and nine months, after admitting fraud by false representation.A warrant has been issued for her arrest and extradition. Yesterday, a judge jailed Philip Borrell for four years and three months and Laura Borrell for three years and nine months. They both admitted money laundering. The couple had appeared on ITV's This Morning with Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield in January 2017. Laura, then 39, described as "one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia", told the presenters: "Whilst I can be an ambassador and get the word out, that's exactly what I want to do." Her fraud was not connected to her dementia.
