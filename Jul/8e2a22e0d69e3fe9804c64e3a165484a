Nick Kyrgios was clearly feeling it in the early stages of his blockbuster match against Stefanos Tsitsipas as he attempted a tweener in just the fourth game. Undoubtedly the biggest match of the tournament to date was Kyrgios' third-round tie against Tsitsipas.  As an unseeded entry, Kyrgios was always going to present a difficult test in the early rounds for some of the elite players on tour. He was given a favourable draw in the first round against British wildcard Paul Jubb, but needed all five sets in a controversial match. Kyrgios ended up being fined for his antics from that clash, where he spat in the direction of a fan and took aim at the line judges. He was more focused in the second round against No 26 seed Filip Krajinovic, dropping just six games in the entire match. That set up a fascinating contest against top seed Tsitsipas, with every other match between the pair producing fireworks. Court One was queueing at every gate for fans trying to catch a glimpse of the match from the very first game. And Kyrgios wasted no time playing up to the crowd when he tried a tweener midway through the fourth game. Tsitsipas had miss-hit a forehand and Kyrgios appeared to know it was going long as he moved the racket behind his back and hit the ball through his legs.  The Wimbledon crowd clearly loved it as they cheered the shot, despite it not counting. And Kyrgios was back at it the follow game on his serve, going one better than Andy Murray. Murray shocked fans this week when he performed an underarm serve in his match against James Duckworth. And Kyrgios outshone the former British No 1 on Court One when he pulled off an underarm serve - through his legs. Tsitsipas was caught out and he failed to get his return over the net as Kyrgios went on to win the point. The Wimbledon crowd were loving Kyrgios' actions on court and those inside Court One were largely on his side.
