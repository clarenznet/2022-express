Frustrated holidaymakers caught up in the chaos took to social media to fume about the queues at Heathrow, Luton, Stansted and Gatwick Airport. Ongoing disruption at airports across the country has been blamed on an industry-wide problem with staffing levels following the Covid pandemic and a spike in demand for travel. But it also comes on the day after Ryanair staff’s three-day walkout over pay in Spain started on Thursday and will run until Saturday. easyJet workers in Spain have also gone on strike today, with two more planned for later in the month. Passengers faced long queues at Ryanair check in desks and were seen sleeping on Stansted Airport floor as they were caught up in the strike disruption. El Cerdo Pedro tweeted: "#StanstedAirport 6AM. Security queues start even before gates, total mess.  "Fast track in 20 minutes." @Marcfish86Ridiculous added: "Situation at #StanstedAirport overcrowding, huge queues for food, and we took advantage of dropping bags day prior. Absolute shambles." Bostrom Photography posted: "HORRENDOUS service from TUI and Stansted. Delays, confusion, miscommunication!! I will NOT fly from STN again or with TUI!"  Others also fumed about the disruption at Luton Airport. Karoline Fahrenkamp said: "@wizzair has been the worst flying experience of my life and not just because i’ve been stuck in @LDNLutonAirport for 20 hours." Jennifer Ferguson added: "@LDNLutonAirport your baggage reclaim for downstairs arrivals is a complete joke. Over 30 minutes wait? Are you joking!?"  Speaking of Gawtick Airport, Sam Johnson posted: "Check in is a bit of a shambles...." Pictures also show queues building at Heathrow's Terminal 3. Ryanair cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy are currently striking in a row over pay. MORE TO FOLLOW
