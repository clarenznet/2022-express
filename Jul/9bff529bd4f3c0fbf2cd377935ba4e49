Lawrence Casey, 86, was pulled unconscious from the water and died despite efforts to save him. Mr Casey, a Merchant Navy and RAF veteran, was walking by Bude Canal, in Cornwall, with daughter Jessica when she suddenly lost control of her mobility scooter and fell in. A paddle board instructor, who had heard the commotion, dived in to rescue Miss Casey, 27, and then started CPR on her unconscious father. Paramedics were soon at the scene, but father-of-nine Mr Casey could not be saved. Cornwall Coroner’s Court heard that the tragedy ­happened last September. The inquest was told Miss Casey, who has cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair and is aided in communication by a ­tablet computer. Her mother, Ruth Casey, told the inquest her estranged husband often went out for walks with her daughter. She said: “Jessica told me that somehow she went into the canal while on her mobility scooter. “I know that Lawrence can swim, and he was a very strong swimmer. Since Lawrence’s death Jessica’s account of what happened has changed several times because of discussions she’s heard between family members trying to piece together what happened.” A post-mortem gave the cause of Mr Casey’s death as drowning. Andrew Cox, senior ­coroner for Cornwall, recorded a conclusion of accidental death.
