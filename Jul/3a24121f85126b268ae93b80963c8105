The Red Arrows, fresh from their appearances at the Platinum Jubilee last month, have a selection of displays scheduled over the weekend. The acrobatic teams participated in an initial flyover on Friday that took them on a broad route from RAF Scampton to Exeter. Today, the planes take off from yesterday's last stop as they participate in three displays. The Red Arrows are due to depart Exeter this afternoon, lifting off from the airport around 1.30pm to arrive for their first performance of the day in Swansea within 20 minutes. After parading through the air for roughly an hour, they return to Exeter before appearing for another display in Teignmouth. The evening display starts around 4.50pm, lasting for roughly 40 minutes before a final transit appearance that brings the planes back to RAF Brize Norton.
