Victoria Beckham, 48, and her husband David Beckham, 47, were seen on a multi-million-pound superyacht during a fun-filled holiday in Sardinia. The married couple enjoyed a day on a yacht in Porto Cervo, with their daughter Harper, son Cruz and his girlfriend Tana Holding. The former Spice Girl unveiled her toned physique in a red two-piece bikini as she put her toned legs and taut abs on full display. She wore her brunette locks down in a sleek style and kept out the sun in a baseball cap while on a superyacht which reportedly costs a huge Â£1.6m a week to charter. David put his toned, muscular arms and chest on full display as he sported a pair of swimming trunks on board the boat. He could be seen hugging his youngest daughter and planting a kiss on her head in a sweet moment on their lavish trip.
