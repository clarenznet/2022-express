The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge headed to SW19 today to watch the Quarter Finals matches of The Championship. Kate dazzled in a turquoise dress with polka dots, accessorised with a chic white handbag and heels. As she set in the royal box, the Duchess was spotted blowing a kiss to someone on her left-hand side, sparking a frenzy among royal fans. Kate and William headed to Wimbledon to cheer on British hopeful Norrie, who played in Court One against American Tommy Paul. The Duchess, who regularly heads to SW19 for The Championship, is the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and a keen tennis fan. During the year, she also struck friendships with professional players, including Roger Federer. The champion, who attended Pippa Middleton's wedding in 2017, reportedly provided Prince George with a few tennis lessons when visiting the Cambridges. MORE TO FOLLOW
