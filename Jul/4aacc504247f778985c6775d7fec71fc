Julia Fox, 32, looked sensational yesterday as she posed in white boxers and a matching bra while she lounged with her legs in the air on top of a yellow taxi in New York. The Uncut Gems star is known for posing in barely-there outfits and for previously dating Kanye West after his divorce from Kim Kardashian. In a series of photos uploaded to her Instagram Story, the actress showed off her sensational figure while “catching a ride” in New York’s Soho district. Julia wore slouchy grey over-the-knee boots while wearing only white lingerie on top of the vehicle in the middle of a busy street. She then lay down on top of the car’s bonnet while attempting to eat a slice of pizza. Onlookers could be seen looking amazed by the spectacle as they took photos on their phones.
