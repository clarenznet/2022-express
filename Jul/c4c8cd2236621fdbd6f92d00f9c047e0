Christine McGuinness, 34, put on a very busty display in a white halter neck tight-fitted top at the England vs Germany Euros final. She teamed it with a pair of figure-hugging denim jeans, featuring ripped detailing. Sharing her outfit to Instagram, she captioned the post in view of her 679,000 followers: "Things I love to see. "Women supporting women, going against the grain, doing what they love, believing in themselves, fighting for equality and our country getting behind them shouting 'Yes girls'." This comes after Christine announced that she had split from Paddy McGuinness last weekend.
