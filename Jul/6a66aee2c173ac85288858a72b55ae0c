A study found it was second only to brisk walks or bike rides in helping to stave off dementia. Those who did chores around the home were 21 per cent less likely to develop it, research of more than half a million older people in Britain discovered. Lead author Professor Huan Song, of Sichuan University in China, said: “Our study found that exercise, household chores and social visits were linked to a reduced risk of various types of dementia. “By engaging more frequently in physical and mental activities people may reduce their risk of dementia.” The UK Biobank study tracked the health of 501,376 older people. The study is published in the journal Neurology.
