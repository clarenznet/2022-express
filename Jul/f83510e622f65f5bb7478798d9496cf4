If you're trying and failing to use Instagram tonight you are not alone with thousands of reports that the popular app keeps on crashing. The gremlins appear to have begun at around 9:30 pm with the problems still ongoing. It's unclear exactly who is affected although some reports suggest that Android phone owners might be suffering more than those with an iPhone. Videos posted online show users opening the application with things then crashing almost immediately. Down Detector - which monitors outages across the globe - is currently showing a steady increase in reports with some 17,00 per minute being shown by its interactive chart. Speaking on its forum page, one user named Emily said: "The app just flashes up for a second and then throws me off." Whilst another called Ak added: "Can someone confirm if Instagram on android doesn't load at all??" Along with those reports on Downdetector, Instagram fans have also rushed to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Posting a tweet, Instagram userÂ Simeon, said: "Why does Instagram keep stopping? Is anyone having this issue?" Another user also tweeted, "Is it just me or does Instagram crash every time you try to open the app too?" There's no word from Instagram on when things will be back online although reports are now dropping so hopefully things will be back to normal soon.
