Wearing a canary yellow t-shirt and white chinos, David started explaining his outfit as he walked towards a large mirror. However, his wife of 23 years decided to chime in at the same time: "So we're, what?" she exclaimed as David confronted her. "I had it first," he said, looking less than happy as Victoria said: "You inspired me!" Turning the camera round, the former Spice Girl revealed that she was wearing a maxi-dress of the same hue. David said: "I had it on first, just for the record," as Posh showed off their matching outfits. "This is not planned," he added as Victoria could be heard laughing. "I'm a fashion inspiration to many!" she explained as David continued protesting before she asked her fans for their view on who copied who.
