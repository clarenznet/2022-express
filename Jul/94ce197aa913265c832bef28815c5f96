Rachel Riley, 36, stayed cool today as she attended the Scala Radio show despite the scorching heatwave. The presenter looked chic in a floral open shoulder top and black shorts when she arrived at Bauer Media studios in London. She showed off her natural beauty by just wearing some natural-looking make-up and a light layer of rouge. The Countdown star kept her hair away from her face by slicking it back in a middle-parted low bun.
