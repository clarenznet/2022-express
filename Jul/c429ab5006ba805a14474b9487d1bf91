Charlotte Casiraghi, 35, and her mother Princess Caroline of Hanover, 65, stepped out on Friday evening together. Princess Caroline and Charlotte presented prizes to the winners at Monaco Longines Pro-Am Cup. This is a show jumping and horse-riding contest that was initiated by Charlotte in 2010.  The Monégasque model wore a £3,360 Chanel silk jacquard dress. The short dress was orange in colour, and finished just above the royal’s knees. Charlotte paired this ruffled dress with a pair of heeled sandals, also from Chanel. The printed lambskin white and black block heels retail for a whopping £970.

She is 11th in line to the throne of Monaco. Her maternal grandparents were Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly.

On December 22, 2020, Charlotte became the brand ambassador of Chanel. She was the global face for Chanel's Spring/Summer 2021 campaign. This explains why she so often wears Chanel clothing on royal engagements.  In 2019, Charlotte married Dimitri Rassam, the son of French actress Carole Bouquet. The couple share a son, Balthazar, who was born in 2018. Charlotte has an older son, Raphaël, who was born in 2013 from a previous relationship.
