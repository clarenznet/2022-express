National Highways has a van to film vehicles on motorways and main A roads – with artificial intelligence used to spot the law-breakers. The parked vehicle has tech to detect tailgating, although not part of a three-month trial working with Warwickshire Police. Drivers caught get a police warning and are asked to do a survey to help National Highways, which is in charge of England’s major roads. The tech was first used in the UK on the M4 in Berkshire last year and detected 25,000 phone offenders and nearly 7,000 people failing to belt up in six months. Jeremy Phillips, of National Highways, said: “We want to see if we can change driver behaviour and therefore improve road safety.” Phone offenders can be fined up to £2,500 while seat-belt penalties are up to £500.
