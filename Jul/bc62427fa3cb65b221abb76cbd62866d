Ex-ministers are facing calls to reject sums totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds that their departures will cost taxpayers. Replying to a tweet saying she was due £16,876.25, Chippenham MP Ms Donelan said: "I shall be donating it in full to a local charity." MPs who leave office are entitled to a quarter of their annual ministerial salary in severance, under the Ministerial and Other Pensions and Salaries Act. Some 60 have quit Government or Tory party roles since Tuesday night. That would take the total payout to £423,000, according to analysis by the Liberal Democrats. Party chiefs urged them not to take the cash, including the departing Prime Minister - who is in line for £18,860.
