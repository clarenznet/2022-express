Loose Women's Linda Robson, 64, was all smiles as she enjoyed a glass of bubbly while soaking up the sun in her deckchair. Her idyllic Italian break looked the picture of relaxation and serenity - and she posted sensational photos from the mountain-backed hotel pool to prove it. The star also donned a belted colourblock one piece from fellow TV star Vicky Pattison's swimwear range, which she referenced in her post. She told her 168,000 followers that the spell in the sunshine was "just what she needed". Linda has long been a fan of Italy, and she even managed to squeeze in a previous holiday in Lake Como during the pandemic.
