George Russell managed to grab a surprise pole for Mercedes at the end of Saturday's qualifying session ahead of this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix. The Brit left it late to pip Carlos Sainz in the dying seconds with a stunning lap to get the Silver Arrows back on the front row of the grid for the very first time this season. It was a hugely impressive effort from Russell, who will lead the other 19 drivers off the line at the start of Sunday's race as a result of his brilliant performance. He will be joined at the front by Sainz, who went quicker than third-placed Charles Leclerc at the end of Q3, while Lando Norris also did well to put his McLaren car up in fourth. Red Bull endured a nightmare session, though, with Sergio Perez being knocked out in Q2 before Max Verstappen was hit with a power unit issue as the clock ticked down. The latter, who still leads in the Drivers' Championship standings by a healthy margin, will be forced to start from 10th on the grid when the five red lights go out to begin Sunday's all-important race.
