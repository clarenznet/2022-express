Famed Friends star Courteney Cox stunned as she went make-up free as the actress was seen going for a walk yesterday. The 58-year-old kept it casual as she rocked jeans teamed with a black shirt and open-toed sandals. She was all smiles as the on-screen star's tresses flowed in loose waves and fell down her shoulders. Courteney has previously opened up about her decision to undergo cosmetic surgery which had left her "looking really strange". The actress said she tried to "chase" youthfulness by getting work done, but ended up regretting the results. "There was a time when you go, 'Oh, I'm changing. I'm looking older,'" Courteney told The Times. "And I didn't realize that, oh s**t, I'm actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now." In a 2017 interview, the actress said she got all her fillers dissolved and was learning to be comfortable with her natural appearance.
