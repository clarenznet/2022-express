Things are beginning to get very interesting indeed in the summer transfer window as Premier League clubs up and down the country start to jet off on their pre-season tours. We are now just four weeks away from the start of the new campaign, and for some teams, reinforcements are desperately needed before then. One of those clubs most in need of. fresh talent is Manchester United. The Red Devils have still only managed to bring in one player so far this summer in the form of left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord as fans begin to lose patience. Yet reports indicate that they are closing in on free agent goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha, although there may not be such good news over RB Leipzig forward Brian Brobbey, who now looks set to join Ajax permanently. On the contrary, Tottenham have been one of the most active clubs so far, bringing in no fewer than five new players so far. They now need to sell in order to balance the books, however, and their brutal decision to leave behind a number of previously important players from their tour to South Korea suggests exits are expected soon. Across London, there's good news for Chelsea, who are closing in on a deal to sign Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. And with the likes of Arsenal, Newcastle, Everton and Leeds also expected to splash more cash, there is plenty to look out for in the coming days and weeks.
