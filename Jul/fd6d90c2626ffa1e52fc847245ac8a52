His long-suffering wife (Phoebe Nicholls) is buttoned up and brisk, keeping up appearances in the community where she was born. When a local child dies, Highland objects to having the church decorated with Walt Disney balloons for the funeral. From this quaint conflict, Beresford tackles issues that include provincial class conflict, the collapse of traditional Anglican faith and the inner turmoil of a Man of the Cloth whose dissatisfaction is temporarily alleviated by tumblers of whisky. The authenticity of the set - a large stone flagged kitchen with the church towering behind - and Nicholas Hytner's unfussy direction help to deliver a modest and old-fashioned play that has moments of piquancy and humour without landing the emotional punch required.
