The Calais MP rejected claims from the UK Government suggesting France's failure to deploy extra border officers is at the heart of the miles-long queues gridlocking the motorway to Dover. Pierre-Henri Dumont claimed Brexit Britain had been warned about the impact of the new checks being introduced once outside of the European Union but failed to act to avoid disruptions. Speaking to Sky News, Les Republicains MP said: "Almost 100 percent of the kiosks given to the French Police to run the checks at the Port of Dover are filled with French police officers. "We cannot do more, we can't go faster than that. The fact is the port is a very small one, is three to four times smaller than the port in Calais. "And I saw that two years ago the British Government decided not to give money to the Port of Dover to improve the number of kiosks for the French Police. "We see the Tory Party is deciding who is going to be the next Prime Minister in the UK, and they're not talking about facts. "They're talking about fake news and they're blaming the French authorities for something that is not on us." JUST IN: This is impeachment!

"Today is going to be very busy, with more UK tourists heading to Dover in order to travel to France." Mr Bannister said he welcomed the "commitment shown by both French and UK authorities to resolve the issue". He insisted the required staffing levels must be maintained for the rest of the summer "so that we can begin to return to the positive experience we had planned for those going on their well-earned breaks".
