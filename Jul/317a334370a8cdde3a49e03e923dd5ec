Figures show that 69,045 private treatments were paid for between last October and December - up 39 percent on the same period in the pre-pandemic year of 2019. The data from the Private Healthcare Information Network (Phin), published yesterday, also shows that hip and knee replacements and cataract surgery are the primary drivers of the growth. Hip replacements were up 141 percent from 2,085 between October and December 2019 to 5,015 during the same period last year, knee replacements rose 111 percent from 1,240 to 2,620, and cataract surgery was up 56 percent from 8,145 to 12,700. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment climbed to a new record of 6.6 million at the end of May. Health experts said the record NHS backlog could be fuelling the demand for private care and that this could "exacerbate inequalities" between people who can afford to pay and those who can't. Jonathon Holmes, policy adviser at think-tank The King's Fund, said if the NHS was providing the access to services that people wanted then they would not be paying for their own care. He added: "Support for the model of a universal healthcare system funded via tax still is what the public largely wants." "People are opting out of the NHS, not opting into the private sector." An NHS spokesman said: "Staff have been working flat out to carry out as many elective procedures as possible, and over the past six months the number of people waiting more than two years has dropped by more than 80 percent."
