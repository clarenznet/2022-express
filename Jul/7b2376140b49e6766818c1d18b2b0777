  Megan McCubbin, who is the nature-loving stepdaughter of Chris Packham, spoke candidly about her love of animals and the need to protect our wildlife in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. The Springwatch presenter revealed that, while she had a tough time at school due to her dyslexia, it was Chris’ partner Charlotte Corney who helped her through.      Megan, who has recently teamed up with Lovat Parks, spoke about the wonders of wildlife and why it can really benefit us all to connect with our “wild side”. The documentarian knows a thing or two about that, as she has grown up with a myriad of diverse creatures all around her. Her most unusual animal friends, however, are the four tigers that were introduced to her by her stepdad’s partner Charlotte. Confirming that she had “no fear” when it came to the wild animals, Megan opened up about the difficult time she had at school and how the tigers helped her not to give up on her zoology dreams.

The experience changed her life, sparking a life-long passion for animal rights campaigning, which has inspired her TV career. This was evident in a 2017 documentary, Undercover Tourist: Inside the Illegal Bear Bile Market. The tigers Megan mentioned were hand-reared by Charlotte, who introduced her to the big cats. “I met them when we were a similar age, so I felt like I was essentially going through my teenage years with them,” Megan reflected. “So I would spend my summers and weekends with them and, because they were hand-reared, it meant that I could have a very close personal relationship with them.      “I was lucky that I got really close to these animals, and they absolutely meant the world to me. Megan then revealed: “It was largely because of them that I really thought to myself, ‘Right. I know what I want. I want to protect their counterparts in the wild.’ “So they really inspired me to do science with dyslexia and pushed me to really learn how to help them, I suppose. They were pretty instrumental, those four cats, for me.” Megan has teamed up with Lovat Parks to reveal the ‘Big 5’ animals that can be spotted on our very own isles this summer in places like Cornwall, Norfolk and the New Forest. Megan McCubbin has identified the UK’s ‘Big 5’ summer wildlife wonders in collaboration with Lovat Parks, the UK’s first B-Corp certified holiday park, encouraging the nation to connect with their wild side this summer and explore the rich diversity of nature in the UK.
