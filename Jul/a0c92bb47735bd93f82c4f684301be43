Amazon Prime Day is globally one of the biggest shopping events and taking place on July 12 and July 13. The two-day event will see thousands of products slashed by 50 percent off or more, but you must be a Prime member to access the deals. If you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial here in order to make the most of the sale. Amazon has already kickstarted the lead up to Prime Day and launched early deals on hair, make-up, skincare and more. With brands including ghd, Olay and Coco & Eve there are major price cuts that shoppers can now get. Last year’s Prime Day saw several popular products being discounted including the Revlon Salon One-Step Volumizer which was 43 percent off and priced at £35.90. This year, it’s expected to go on sale with other hair tools from BaByliss, making it the perfect opportunity to get a dupe for the Dyson Airwrap. In addition, the CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser was reduced to £4.94 last year and is also expected to go on sale again. Plus, Coco & Eve will be slashing up to 30 percent off its haircare and tanning range. The deals won’t last for long though so be quick to buy before it sells out. Shop all the beauty deals here.
