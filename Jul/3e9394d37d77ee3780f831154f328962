Sylvester Stallone recently landed a role in the TV series Tulsa King, so there was every reason for him to embrace the party mood two days ahead of his actual birthday. The Hollywood actor showed up at Via Alloro in Beverly Hills with his glamorous wife Jennifer, 53, plus their three daughters, Sistene, Sophia and Scarlett, who are all in their 20s. Sylvester donned a crisp white shirt and a pair of blue jeans for his LA outing, with a pair of green suede boots to add a splash of colour. Meanwhile, Sistine stunned in a long black gown with a slit up one thigh, adding a pair of black backless peep toe heels to match. Sylvester's brother Frank was also at the birthday bash, wearing a bright yellow shirt for the occasion.
