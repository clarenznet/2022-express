Sienna Miller, 40, showed off her sensational figure in a tiny white bikini as she enjoyed the St Tropez break. She was joined by her younger beau Oli Green, 25, for the romantic break away. The pair were pictured soaking up the sun and loving each other's company at the Eden Roc hotel. Sienna looked incredible in the skimpy bikini, showing off her taut abs and bronzed tan. She accessorised with sunglasses and a crochet bucket hat, which shielded her from the heat. Meanwhile, Oli showed off his tan, stripping down to a pair of navy swim shorts for the occasion. Sienna first went public with her new relationship in February and the lovebirds were pictured packing on the PDA at Wimbledon.
