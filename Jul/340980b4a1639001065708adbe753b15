Coleen and Wayne Rooney, both 36, looked like they were having a wonderful time together at Wimbledon today. The couple brought their son Kai, 12, to watch the centre court action. Coleen was still wearing her plastic air boot on her foot after breaking a bone in her foot when she suffered a fall. Otherwise, she looked incredibly stylish in a short white broderie dress. Her footballer husband Wayne dressed down in a black polo shirt and brown trousers, while his mini me Kai also wore a cast on both his legs. The couple, who have been married since 2008, are awaiting the judgeâ€™s verdict of the WAGatha Christie trial against Rebekah Vardy.
