The Prime Minister was met with his own MPs "shaking their heads" with "faces like thunder" during today's session of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), according to political commentators Ben Glaze and Camilla Tominey. Their comments come after Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid sent shockwaves through Westminster on Tuesday when they resigned from the Cabinet over Mr Johnson's handling of the Chris Pincher scandal. They have since been followed by a wave of junior ministers citing similar reasons. Responding to a question by Labour's Ian Lavery during PMQs, Mr Johnson said: "He should hang on in there, that's what I'm going to do." To compound problems, a shocking new poll by Britain Elects shows that, should a general election vote be held today, Labour would be the largest party and Mr Johnson would lose his seat. Sir Keir Starmer's party is predicted to get 306 seats to the Conservative's 245. READ COVERAGE BELOW...
