He will state in a speech today to an online event for the think tank Green Alliance: “Nature is indivisible and interdependent. It provides us with a host of things we depend upon, such as clean water, clean air and food. “No nature, no food. It’s vital in providing resilience to climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide, regulating local climatic conditions and providing flood protection. No nature, no climate shield. And as humans, we depend on green and blue spaces for our own health and well-being. No nature, no us.” Sir James says that 15 percent ­of our native species are threatened with extinction while EA evidence also shows 41 percent of species have decreased in abundance ­since 1970. His speech will underline the loss of precious habitats – such as meadows, wetlands and woods – will result in a “shocking decline in the plants and animals that depend on them”. The Daily Express Green Britain Needs You campaign has called on everyone to do their bit for the planet.
