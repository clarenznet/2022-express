But the RMT union said it meant a pay cut over the next two years and would axe a third of maintenance roles and half of scheduled maintenance work.

"We will not hesitate to call further strike action if the industry continues to fob us off." Network Rail said it was offering a two-year deal worth more than five percent and extra for those paid under Â£30,000.
