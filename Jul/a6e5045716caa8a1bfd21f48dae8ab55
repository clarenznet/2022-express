Holidaymakers have no right to demand entry to a foreign country, even if they have bought a holiday there, and must comply with all passport rules. If you are travelling to an EU hotspot such as Spain or France, your passport must have been issued fewer than 10 years before your planned date of entry. Up to 2018, the UK government allowed for unspent time on passports to be added to the new passport at renewal, which means that some UK passports are valid for more than 10 years. This was not a problem before Brexit, but it is now, except for trips to Ireland. Also, your passport must be valid for at least three months after the day you plan to leave the EU. Rules vary for non-EU countries. For example, in Turkey your passport needs to be valid for six months after your arrival date. Whereas for the US or Canada, it only needs to be valid for the duration of your stay. Despite the risks, a third of Britons do not know the rules for their destination, research from GoCompare shows. Its travel spokesperson Ceri McMillan said it is vital to check entry rules as early as possible, as getting a new passport typically takes 10 weeks. "It would be heart-breaking to get to the airport, only to get turned away," she added. The Foreign Office provides a list of different country entry requirements.
