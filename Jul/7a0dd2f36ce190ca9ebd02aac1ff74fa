Nick Kyrgios, 27, and girlfriend Costeen Hatzi, 22, have been seen looking smitten with one another during a training session on Sunday. The pair started dating in December and have been in a relationship ever since.  The loved-up couple were seen smooching courtside as Nick was clearly unable to keep his hands off Costeen.  They didn’t appear to be getting much training done as Costeen playfully pulled away from Nick as he went to kiss her.  Costeen, an aspiring Instagram influencer and university graduate, was dressed in a white denim jacket over a crop top and black leggings.  She completed her look with Gucci sunglasses and white Nike sneakers, and occasionally donned a pair of thick black sunglasses.
