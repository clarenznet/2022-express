"This winner has just become the biggest National Lottery winner of all time, the fourth lucky EuroMillions jackpot winner here this year and the 15th UK winner of over £100 million. "Players are urged to check their tickets and to give us a call if they think they are tonight's record-breaking lucky winner." Mr Carter added: "Thanks to National Lottery players, more than £30M is generated every week for Good Causes across the country. "This supports everything from local projects making a difference where you live, to our nations' athletes at the upcoming Commonwealth Games.” The winner will get £195,707,000. The National Lottery EuroMillions winning numbers are: 6, 23, 27, 40, 41 and the Lucky Stars are: 2, 12 .
