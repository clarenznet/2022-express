Council tax is an annual payment that's used by the council for local upkeep. People over 18 years old usually have to pay council tax, although some people will be exempt. You won't need to pay council tax if you're under 18, if you're in full-time education, a student nurse, are severely mentally impaired, or are a diplomat. ...and to make it even more confusing, there isn't one set fee - you could be paying different amounts of council tax compared with your friends or family. Council tax is simply a payment that's made every year for local services. Your local police and fire services rely on council tax payments, as well as libraries and schools. The tax also covers waste disposal, highway services, street lighting, and cleaning. The amount you pay depends on where you live, how much the council needs funding, and your personal circumstances. When you move into a new home, you'll need to let the local council know that you live there. You'll be assigned a tax band, ranging from Band A to Band H, with A the cheapest, and H the most expensive. You can check your council tax band online by heading to GOV.UK. If you think your home might be in the wrong council tax, you can appeal to the council. When you inform the council that you've moved into a new home, you'll be sent new information about paying your bills. The easiest way to pay is to arrange a direct debit online, where the council automatically takes the payment. The annual payment will normally be split into 10 months, although there is an option to pay in 12-month installments.
