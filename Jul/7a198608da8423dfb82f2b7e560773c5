Louise Redknapp, 47, looked amazing as she partied the night away at London Pride. The singer posted a short video on Instagram in view of her 749,000 followers. The mother-of-two can be seen partying the night away as she showed off her incredible dance moves. She wore an orange crop top and skinny jeans, leaving her toned midriff on full display. Louise showed off her long tresses as she styled them in a light wave. This comes as Louise recently had to reunite with her ex-husband Jamie Redknapp to celebrate their son's huge milestone at college before he heads to university. The former couple, who were married between 1998 and 2018, share two children, Charley, 17, and 13-year-old Beau.
