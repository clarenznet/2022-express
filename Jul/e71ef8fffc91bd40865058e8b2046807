Tommy Cimato, who has 16 years' experience in the trade, has stressed it is unhygenic for passengers to rest against windows as they might not be particularly clean. He said: "You are not the only one that has done that and you don't know how many people or children have wiped their hands or other things all over the window." Many aeroplane passengers like to relax or take a nap during flights across the world. But Tommy pointed out germs may remain on surfaces on aircraft, just like in any room in your own home. He also advised holidaymakers to not wear shorts on a flight, Mirror reports. "Don’t or try not to wear shorts when you're on an airplane. It's the same thing as the window – you never know how clean it's going to be, so if you have pants, you're going to have less germs," the flight attendant added. Jetsetters, though, typically opt for shorts on a plane due to increased levels of comfort. The travel expert also offered hygiene advice regarding toilets on aircrafts. He said: "Do not ever touch the flush button with your bare hands. "It's honestly just super unsanitary and pretty gross, so when you flush, use a napkin or tissue that's in the lavatory." Deanna Castro, who has also worked as a flight attendant for around 15 years, said tourists should always step into their row to let other passengers pass when they board planes. She told InsideHook: "When boarding, it’s polite to step into your row and allow other passengers to pass behind you. "It’s okay to take a few extra minutes to get ready, but please step into the aisle and wait for a lull in traffic."
