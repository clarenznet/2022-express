Dan Gick, Managing Director of Scrap Car Comparison, said: “Your car’s air conditioning system can be a real life saver during a heat wave, but it’s important to carry out regular checks throughout the year to ensure everything is working efficiently when the temperatures outside start to rise. “Consult your vehicle’s handbook for further information on the inner workings of your air conditioning system, and stick to the service schedule to ensure any issues are spotted early. “If you do notice that your air conditioning system isn’t working, you should contact a professional technician to carry out checks and any repairs as soon as possible.

If you’re turning your air conditioning system on for the first time in a few months, you may notice that the system is clogged or faulty, leaving both drivers and passengers to suffer in an overheating vehicle. Just like oils and other liquids in your vehicle, the coolant used by your air conditioning system also needs to be refreshed and recharged.

If your air conditioning levels are reducing faster than expected, you could have a leak in your system, which could emit harmful gases into the environment if not checked. To regas or recharge your air con system, the coolant will need to be drained, and refilled and key parts of the system re-lubricated to ensure all is working efficiently. While you can buy DIY kits to regas your air conditioning system yourself, it’s not advisable if you’ve never done it before. The kits themselves are almost as expensive as paying a specialist to do it – and you could be left with an expensive repair bill if anything goes wrong. If you’re noticing a nasty smell when you first turn on your air conditioning in the summer, this could mean that your air conditioning needs a good clean. Dust and liquid can build up in your air conditioning system over time, leading to your car being filled with unpleasant smells. Regular cleaning will also reduce the risk of malfunction over time, which is often caused by the build-up of bacteria, dust and debris. To ensure everything is running correctly and to avoid deterioration over the winter months, it’s recommended that you run the air conditioning system in your car for around 10 minutes every week – even in the colder winter months. When doing this, ensure that the system is set on the highest speed and coolest setting to test the system to its maximum capability. Many of us will automatically shut down the engine without turning the air conditioning system off, once we’ve reached our destination. However, doing this can damage your air conditioning system, as the fans continue to run and collect build-ups of dust and bacteria. To avoid this, switch your air con off after usage to allow the air to remain fresher and your air conditioning system to work more efficiently for longer.
