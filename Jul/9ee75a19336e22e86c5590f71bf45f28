Naomi Watts, 53, stunned as she slipped into a sheer black floor-length dress that exposed her endless legs. The actress looked elegant as she attended Christian Dior’s Fall Winter 2022 show at Paris Fashion Week. The flowy gown featured a high neck and was paired with matching strappy heels and gold jewellery. Naomi opted to keep her straight short hair down and middle parted, while keeping her makeup minimal with just a touch of colour on the lips.
