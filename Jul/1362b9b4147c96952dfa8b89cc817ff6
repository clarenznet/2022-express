John Wick’s been on quite the journey since coming out of retirement. In John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, he was labelled “excommunicado” for the unauthorised killing of High Table crime lord Santino D’Antonio inside the New York Continental Hotel. Naturally, Keanu Reeves’ assassin managed to survive and make his way to The Elder, the only person above the High Table. In the Moroccan desert, The Elder agreed to pardon Wick if he killed his friend Winston, the New York Continental manager and remained under the authority of the High Table. So the assassin made an oath of fealty by severing his ring finger and giving his wedding ring to The Elder. However, upon returning to New York, Winston refused to abdicate and Wick refused to kill him, so they teamed up again the High Table’s attacks on the hotel. In the end, the manager agreed to a parley and offered his fealty to the High Table before strategically shooting Wick without killing him and making him fall off the roof of the Continental. John Wick Chapter 3 ended with Reeves’ assassin being secretly delivered to Laurence Fishburne’s Bowery King and the two agreed to take on the High Table.
