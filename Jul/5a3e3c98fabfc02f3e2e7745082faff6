The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Gina 10mg vaginal tablets will be available for women aged 50 and above who have not had a period for at least a year. The tablets treat vaginal symptoms such as dryness, soreness and itching, caused by a lack of oestrogen. Pharmacists will be able to use training materials and a checklist to ensure the tablets are prescribed appropriately. Other vaginal tablets will still be available on prescription. Health minister Maria Caulfield said: “This is a huge step forward in enabling women to access HRT as easily as possible.” The cost has not been made public but one estimate puts it at £2.50 a week.
