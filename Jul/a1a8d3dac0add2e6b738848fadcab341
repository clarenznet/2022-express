Max Verstappen will start this year's Austrian Grand Prix from pole position after breezing to a simple victory ahead of Charles Leclerc at the end of Saturday's sprint event. The Dutchman was forced to defend his lead at the start of the 23-lap contest but managed to keep Leclerc at arm's length and never looked back on his way to the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring. Leclerc was simply not quick enough to challenge Verstappen over the course of the sprint, with the defending world champion hardly breaking a sweat as he cruised to victory by a margin of almost two seconds. Carlos Sainz managed to secure a third-placed grid position for Sunday's race after finishing just behind Leclerc, with George Russell crossing the line in fourth. It was a hugely frustrating session for Lewis Hamilton, though, with the 37-year-old struggling to get around Mick Schumacher until he was finally able to squeeze down the inside with only a few laps remaining. He will start the Austrian Grand Prix from eighth place after making up just one position in the sprint following his unfortunate crash in Q3 on Friday. Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
