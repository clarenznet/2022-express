Now, as these stunning pictures show, the couple have cemented their long romance with a fairytale wedding in the Maldives. Jordan, 28, clutched 26-year-old Megan to him with a safe pair of hands as they posed for photographs. The couple actually tied the knot in March 2020 but were forced to postpone the ceremony with family and friends until last month. As 13 guests looked on and with the Indian Ocean as the backdrop, they said “I do” on a white podium fringed with pink roses. In one of the shots released on Instagram, they danced together, barefoot, on the beach, and in another, they cradled their three-year-old son Arlo. Megan wore a stunning white off-the-shoulder Berta gown embellished with floral lace detailing and an extravagant fishtail train. Her Everton keeper husband wore a smart white tuxedo with matching shirt, waistcoat and bow tie and brown loafers. Alongside the snaps, Megan posted: “Worth the wait for the most magical day with my soulmate. Introducing The Pickfords | 18.06.2022.” The couple met as pupils of the same Catholic school in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and began dating when he was 16 and she 14. Their engagement was made public at the 2018 World Cup in Russia when Megan was seen for the first time wearing their ring.
