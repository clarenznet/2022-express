Johnny Depp, 59, appeared in great spirits last night as he surfaced in public for the first time since his ex-wife Amber Heard's appeal was rejected. The Pirates of The Caribbean actor could be seen smiling and waving at fans as he emerged from a vehicle after his concert with Jeff Beck in Munich, Germany. His appearance came after a US judge rejected Amber’s request for a new trial in her multimillion-dollar defamation case with Johnny over “improper juror service”. Penney Azcarate, who presided over the case, dismissed claims that an individual juror had not been properly vetted and said the jury had made a “competent decision”.
