Fortnite developer Epic Games is about to introduce another new crossover to the hugely popular Battle Royale game. The next Fortnite item shop update adds WWE Superstar John Cena to the game. Launching in time for this weekend's Summerslam event (which John Cena isn't currently booked for), the John Cena item shop bundle has a July 28 release date. However, because of the time differences, UK fans will be able to grab the bundle when the item shop gets a refresh at 1am BST on July 29. According to Epic Games, the John Cena bundle contains both the entrance gear and ring gear outfits. Specifically, this means you can select to play as John Cena with his signature T-shirt on or off. The full John Cena bundle also contains the WWE Championship Title Back Bling, the open-hand Five Digit Slapper Pickaxe, and the U Can't C Me Emote. The first WWE-endorsed Fortnite crossover was announced on the Epic Games website, alongside a description about what to expect. "As part of the Epic SummerSlam, 16-time Champion John Cena gives opponents an Attitude Adjustment in Fortnite. "The John Cena Outfit is available in the Item Shop starting July 28 at 8pm ET, complete with the Entrance Gear and Ring Gear Styles." "No, the Outfit doesn’t actually have an invisibility feature, but it will have matching accessories available! "Also coming to the Item Shop are more items from the John Cena Set: the WWE Championship Title Back Bling (included with the Outfit), the open-hand Five Digit Slapper Pickaxe, and the U Can't C Me Emote (pictured above… if you can see it.) Make your opponents no match for Big Match John!" Additional WWE-themed items and events are coming to other Epic Games such as Fall Guys and Rocket League. Asuka, Xavier Woods, and The Undertaker outfits will be available in Fall Guys, while Roman Reigns or John Cena Decals are coming to Rocket League. Expect the items to be available for the entirety of the weekend.
