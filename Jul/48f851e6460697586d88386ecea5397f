Gwyneth Paltrow, 49, who relies on her personal trainer Harley Pasternak to stay fit and healthy, showed off her G. Label clothing company as she looked sensational in a £295 pair of “Geiger” high-rise, wide-leg jeans, which come in medium blue and ivory. Gwyneth posted the racy pics on Instagram on Sunday, typing: “We rarely restock our pieces but we had to bring back these wide-legs!” Unfortunately for fans, the Goop founder is not selling the white bikini bottoms or the straw sun hat she wore with the $395 black 'Fallon' tie-back top that can be seen in some of her pics. Also in the Iron Man actress' new collection was the $575 “Block Ruffle-Collar” mini-dress and detachable belt bag, which she called “the perfect walking around a city summer dress". Gwyneth also said the $550 “Joseph Round-Sleeve” jumpsuit from her clothing company “is meant to span the seasons” as she wears it with sandals in the summer and trainers in the fall.
