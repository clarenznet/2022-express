Beautifully staged in pyramids of light, it features a live band who produce a sparse soundtrack and support the singing of Alice (Ella Hunt) whose habit of walking in front of traffic suggests either youthful distraction or suicidal tendencies. She meets obituary writer Dan (Poldark’s Jack Farthing) and soon they are shacking up together. Meanwhile, Dan’s cruel internet prank on Larry (Sam Troughton) sets him up with the self-possessed Anna (Nina Toussaint-White). After a bout of girlfriend-swapping, everything really starts to unravel. As the most vulnerable of the four, Alice is both catalyst and destabilising element. Part psychological mystery, part erotic social comedy, it remains a provocative exploration of sexual mores.
