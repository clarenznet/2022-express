The structure and riverbank has been cordoned off in Salford, Greater Manchester, as police officers and firefighters investigate. Photographs show paramedics also at the scene beside tram tracks and the River Irwell. A Manchester Evening News reporter at the scene says forensic officers have been at the scene this morning. But police are yet to confirm the exact nature of the incident. Reporter Chris Slater tweeted: "A cordon is currently in place close to the banks of the River Irwell. Steps to a path running alongside the river and a footbridge which runs over the water to Castlefield are both currently taped off with an officer standing guard. "At least a dozen emergency vehicles are currently parked. They include a police van, two police cars, four fire engines and four ambulance service incident response unit vehicles." Greater Manchester Police, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service have been approached for more information. It comes weeks after emergency services descended on nearby Manchester city centre after a suspicious package was found. A large cordon was put up in the heart of the city, as the device was discovered in the grass beside tram tracks. A number of police vehicles and police officers were seen guarding the area for hours in June. Residents in the area were evacuated while police investigated the item. One woman said: "I've just been evacuated from our building on Chapeltown Street and we were told by police there's a suspicious package and they're evacuating all buildings due to a 'shatter risk' to windows and it could be a couple of hours." But the device was later deemed "non-suspicious" and the residents were allowed back in their properties after around two hours.
