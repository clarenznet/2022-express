Manchester United continue to face an ongoing headache regarding the future of talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, after details of his showdown transfer talks with the club finally started to emerge. Despite the Red Devils bringing in the likes of legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo seems dead-set on leaving Old Trafford once again in search of etching his name even more firmly in the history books. It has transpired that certain Lionel Messi records are the driving force behind his increased desire to depart, and now it has come to light that further talks with additional clubs have now begun. Elsewhere Chelsea are licking their wounds after losing out on yet another player, following Jules Kounde's official move to Barcelona. The Blues are desperate for solid defensive reinforcements and this has now led them to the doorstep of Leicester City, who face a task on their hands when it comes to retaining the services of Wesley Fofana. Over at Anfield Liverpool have made their intentions clear when it comes to veteran star Roberto Firmino, who is wanted by a host of clubs given he currently has just one year remaning on his contract on Merseyside. Now, recent reports suggest Liverpool could even inadvertently help Chelsea out with an injection of transfer funds, given Jurgen Klopp has made his stance on his Brazilian striker clear.
