Max Verstappen looked 'increasingly horrified' duruing an exchange with Charles Leclerc after an action-packed British Grand PrixÂ saw Carlos Sainz pick up his maiden Formula 1 win in a race that saw almost a third of the grid retire. Ferrari team-mate Leclerc finished fourth while standings leader Verstappen settled for seventh at Silverstone, the first time this season that both drivers have failed to podium. Spectators watched as chaos unfolded almost immediately in Northamptonshire, and an early tangle meant Zhou Guanyu, George Russell and Alexander Albon failed to complete a lap. Alfa Romeo driver Zhou was particulalry fortunate to escape major injury after his car flipped and skidded upside down before becoming lodged between the barriers trackside. Red Bull ace Verstappen avoided that early melee but was later forced to pit after driving over debris caused by a collision between AlphaTauri team-mates Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda. The titleholder's car struggled to gain pace for the remainder of the race, but Verstappen nonetheless saw seventh as "a good result" given all the obstacles thrown his way. The surprises seemingly weren't limited to the race, either, after he was seen reacting to a conversation with good friend Leclerc following the chequered flag. Cameras picked up footage of Verstappen talking to the Ferrari star, with his mouth increasingly agape as their chat progressed.
