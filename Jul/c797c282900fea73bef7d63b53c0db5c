Manchester United's pursuit of more signings ahead of the new Premier League season continues. Erik ten Hag has signed Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez so far this summer but is desperately chasing Frenkie de Jong and had also wanted to sign another Ajax player in Antony. The new Premier League season is just a week away while the transfer window remains open until September 1. And United may have to wait until after the new campaign gets underway to welcome more new arrivals as they struggle to make progress over De Jong. A deal is agreed with Barcelona but the Dutch midfielder is holding firm because he is owed £14million in deferred wages by the Spanish club and expects to be paid. He will also not take a pay cut in order to stay at Barca, leaving the Catalan club seeking a resolution. They have already approved a sale but the player is proving obdurate. Elsewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo still wants out of the club. The Portuguese striker prefers to play in the Champions League but is finding it difficult to locate a feasible destination. His big wages, age and demands to be competitive in the European Cup have limited his options to very few clubs with the likes of Chelsea, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich seeking to rule themselves out of a move. Sporting Lisbon, Ronaldo's former club, have now however emerged as a potential option. Follow all of the latest news coming out of Old Trafford with Express Sport below...
