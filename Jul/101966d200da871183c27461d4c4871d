Queen Mathilde of Belgium, 49, stepped out on Thursday at Saint Michael and Saint Gudula Cathedral in Brussels with the rest of her family. The Belgian Royal Family are celebrating Belgian National Day and are all wearing different monochrome colours.  Queen Mathilde wore a yellow/orange dress paired with the ‘Paris’ hat designed by Fabienne Delvigne. This is a Belgian hat company and is also a Belgian Royal Warrant Holder. The ‘Pairs’ hat has a caramel hue and is trimmed with matching natural fibre. The heir to the Belgian throne, Princess Elisabeth, 20, stepped out in a gorgeous ankle-length red dress.  Elisabeth wore a Victoria Beckham ‘Keyhole Detail V Neck Midi Occasion wear’ dress. It retails for €990, or roughly £843. The 20-year-old Princess gave a nod to her mother by carrying her clutch bag. The bag is designed by A Bag With A Story and is called the Guinto Clutch.  For footwear, Elisabeth opted for her Jimmy Choo Romy nude suede pumps. These shoes cost a whopping £550. She kept the monochrome red look with her red headband, also by Fabienne Delvigne. Elisabeth accessorised with a pair of gold earrings by Christine Bekaert and a 115 Euro Champa Duo ring from the same brand. This costs roughly £98 in British Sterling.

The dress featured short sleeves and was about knee-length.  Prince Gabriel, 18, wore a blue tie to match Eleonore’s dress, and Prince Emmanuel, 16, wore a red tie to match Elisabeth’s dress. Queen Mathilde, King Philippe and the heir to the throne Princess Elisabeth formed the colours of the Belgian flag with the colour of their clothes. Philippe’s uniform was black, Elisabeth wore a red Victoria Beckham gown and Mathilde wore a bright yellow dress. The Belgian flag is black, red and yellow so this was a sweet nod to their country on their National Day.
