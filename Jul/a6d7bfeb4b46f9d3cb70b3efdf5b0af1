The average adult currently has 10 good friends – with one in ten knowing their closet companion since they were six. It also emerged 17 years is the average length of a friendship – although 17 percent have had the same best friend for more than 30 years. When quizzed on what makes a good friend, giving honest outfit advice, making each other laugh, and sending embarrassing photos on a birthday, were cited as the top things. The research was commissioned by Disney, as part of its Wonder of Friendship campaign, that celebrates Mickey Mouse and Friends’ iconic friendships. Sarah Fox, vice president of marketing and communications for Disney consumer products, gaming and publishing EMEA, said: “Friendships are vital – but as we get older, they can become more difficult to maintain for a variety of different reasons. “That’s why it’s so uplifting to see how much importance we put on having strong, lasting bonds with our friends, and celebrate Disney best Pals Mickey and Friends, who exemplify a lifetime of friendship this International Friendship Day.” Seven in ten said their friend sees them as someone they can always turn to for help – with relationships being the most common topic of conversation. The average time spent with a friend per week is four hours, while 48 percent claim it’s unusual to go a day without talking to them. But the study, conducted via OnePoll, also found half (49 percent) wish they could see their buddies more often. Living too far away, and life getting in the way, were cited as the most common barriers for this. TOP 20 THINGS THAT MAKE A GOOD FRIEND:
