If you examine the shambles of the Passport Office, the DVLA, the Immigration Service and many of the failings during Covid much can be put down to the Civil Service. If Labour was in office it would be the same. If the PM wants to get a grip of this country he needs to make major changes and rid this country of the many “Sir Humphreys” still clinging to power, causing division and chaos. Richard Mellor, Borwick, Lancs ---------------------------------------- Give them their marching orders if they don’t obey  If attorney General Suella Braverman is being resisted by Whitehall civil servants (“‘Mandarins have Remain bias’”, July 4), then give them their marching orders. They are employed to carry out their masters’ will, not their own. Kath Gifford, Sandwich, Kent ---------------------------------------- MPs on phones all seemed to be otherwise engaged I was amazed to see almost half the MPs sitting around Boris Johnson during such an important announcement were all staring at their phones (“Boris: tax cuts of £330 for 30M will ease ‘tough times’”, July 5). Why were they there at all, as they didn’t appear to be listening to a word the he was saying? It’s about time mobile phones were banned from the chamber as it shows MPs in a very poor light. I’m beginning to wonder why we vote for them at all. Jacqueline Willard, Forest Gate, Gtr London ---------------------------------------- Police are guilty of double standards over protests.  How come the police arrest drivers for slow and dangerous driving when they’re protesting about extortionate fuel costs but stand by and protect environmental protesters blocking roads and disrupting traffic? Why the double standards (“Fears fuel price protests will continue all summer”, July 5)? Pete Widdows, Heacham, Norfolk
