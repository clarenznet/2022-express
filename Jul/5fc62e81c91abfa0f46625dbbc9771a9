 Gwyneth Paltrow, 49, was glowing on Monday as she hosted an event promoting her skin and haircare line Goopglow in East Hampton, New York. The actress wowed in a sparkling yellow satin ensemble as she was joined by several other famous faces.  She was seen alongside Savannah Guthrie, Rachel Zoe, Jessica Capshaw and Jessica Seinfeld.  Gwyneth had all eyes on her as she showed off her stunning figure.  The star’s outfit resembled cosy silk loungewear, which she matched with a set of furry yellow green slippers.  She wore a canary yellow top, which she left open and unbuttoned, displaying her toned stomach and matching yellow bra.
