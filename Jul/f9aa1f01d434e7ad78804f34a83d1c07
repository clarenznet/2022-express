The steam-snorting beast was the centrepiece of a ceremony celebrating host city Birmingham’s heritage, culture and creativity... and a nod to its Bull Ring shopping centre. Prince Charles made his own dramatic entrance, driving wife Camilla into the Alexander Stadium in his eco-fuelled Aston Martin DB6 Volante. And while the Queen wasn’t there to repeat her “parachute jump” from the 2012 Olympics, her son read her welcome, stashed in the relay baton last year before a trip round the Commonwealth. Wishing athletes “every success”, he said: “In the words of the founder of the games, we embark once again on a novel adventure here in Birmingham. A city which now welcomes you all in friendship.” The couple were joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex for a show that included 72 red, white or blue cars linked to Birmingham’s car industry and a Red Arrows flypast.
