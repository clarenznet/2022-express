Maggie Smith, 87, appeared in 1969’s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. The Downton Abbey star looked unrecognisable as she sported a retro ginger hairstyle for the late 60's film.  Her role in the film was that of an aggressive and unrestrained teacher at an all-girls school in Edinburgh.  The film presents Jean Brodie as a teacher who encourages her students to embrace romantic ideal as opposed to teaching them cold facts.  Things become complicated after her contentious methods attract the attention of the school’s headmistress Miss Mackay.  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is on today at 4pm on Great Movies Classic channel.
