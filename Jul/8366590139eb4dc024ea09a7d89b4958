In a major policy announcement in the Tory leadership contest, the Foreign Secretary will commit herself to a bonfire of Brussels laws and red tape. She has drawn up the plan in an effort to bolster her credentials as the candidate most committed to maximising the benefits of Brexit in her battle against Rishi Sunak for the Tory crown. Ahead of her announcement, Ms Truss said: “As Prime Minister, I will unleash the full potential of Britain post-Brexit, and accelerate plans to get EU law off our statute books so we can boost growth and make the most of our new-found freedoms outside of the EU. “I have proved as trade secretary and in the Foreign Office that I am the candidate who can be trusted to deliver on the promise of Brexit and make Britain a higher-growth powerhouse. “EU regulations hinder our businesses and this has to change. In Downing Street, I will seize the chance to diverge from outdated EU law and frameworks and capitalise on the opportunities we have ahead of us.”  Last month, Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg announced plans to axe all remaining EU laws by June 2026. But Ms Truss, who backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, has signalled she is prepared to drive the proposal through at a much faster pace. A source close to Ms Truss said: “Liz has done more than most to deliver on Brexit across her roles in Government. She’s been frustrated that we haven’t been quicker to ditch EU law. “As PM, she’d be committed to working at pace to deliver the full benefits of Brexit and make sure EU laws are removed or replaced by British law.”
