Liz Hurley, 57, made the most of the glorious sunshine during the UK heatwave as she flaunted her incredible curves in view of her 2.4 million followers yesterday. As temperatures reached record levels, the Austin Powers actress made the most of it as she donned a straw hat while holding suntan lotion. She captioned the post: "Hat and SPF [Sun protection Factor]." Liz accessorised her look with a pair of big sunglasses as she flaunted her taut abs and toned legs.
