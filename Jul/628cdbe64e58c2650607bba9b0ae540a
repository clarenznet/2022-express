Amanda Holden, 51, commanded attention today as she posed for photographers outside Global Radio in Central London. The Heart Breakfast radio show host looked fabulous in a summery floral printed dress that put her toned legs and back on display. She could beÂ seen smiling over her shoulder at the cameras, as she showed off her chic backless dress. Amanda paired the colourful gown with a pair of bright pink stilettos and a matching bumbag she wore across her body, finishing off the look with some dark shades.
