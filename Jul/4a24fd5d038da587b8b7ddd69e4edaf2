At the official launch of his campaign for the Tory leadership, the senior backbencher and former Army officer will set out a 10-year plan for growth that includes pledges of investment in infrastructure and skills to ensure the UK is ready for the business challenges of the future. He will also call for a “stronger, fairer and more resilient economy.” Supporters insist the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman is a “natural tax cutter” and point out he was the only leadership contender to have voted against Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s National Insurance hike. The MP will use his campaign launch in Westminster today to flesh out his policy platform and show that tax cuts are just one element of a wide-ranging plan for growth. Mr Tugendhat is expected to argue for tax cuts to stimulate investment including research and development tax breaks. He will also say that tax cuts must be accompanied by a range of other measures from improved infrastructure in roads, rail and digital as well as skills investment, including a doubling down on high quality technical colleges. Reforms of outdated EU regulations are also needed to unlock billions of pounds worth of taxpayers’ cash for public spending. Ahead of his campaign launch, Mr Tugendhat said last night: “I am committed to reducing the tax burden on people and businesses across the UK. It’s great to see colleagues following my lead in arguing for a reversal of the National Insurance rise. “And only by cutting the cost of fuel which is hitting drivers in their back pockets can we drive down price. “Tax cuts cannot be the only round in the magazine to fire growth in the economy. “A 10-year growth plan will include both targeted and sensible tax cuts along with other measures to stimulate investment, creating jobs and investment in every part of the UK.”
