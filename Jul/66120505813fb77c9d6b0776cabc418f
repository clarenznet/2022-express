Ruth Langsford, 62, cosied up to husband Eamonn Holmes, 62, this afternoon as they posed for the cameras at the TRIC Awards 2022. The pair were joined in some of the pictures by Eamonn’s GB News Breakfast co-host Isabel Webster, 39, who is the star's new "TV wife" after fronting This Morning with Ruth for 14 years. The trio looked fabulous as they suited up for the occasion - with Ruth wearing an orange blazer, Eamonn in a navy suit, and Isabel looking elegant in a nude number. Ruth paired her blazer with black straight-legged trousers and gold sandals, while Isabel wore white shorts and neutral-toned stilettos.
