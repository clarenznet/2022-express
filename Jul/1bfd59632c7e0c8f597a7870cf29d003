The grim milestone comes as infections and hospital admissions are again on the rise, driven by subvariant Omicron BA.2 - though the number of deaths remains well below levels reached in previous waves. A total of 200,247 deaths involving Covid have now been registered, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This includes all instances where it has been mentioned on someone's death certificate, either as a main cause or a contributory factor. The 200,000-mark was reached on June 25, but only now confirmed due to the time it takes for the deceased to be registered. Covid-19 deaths stayed low by historic standards during each of this year's waves, reflecting the success of vaccines in weakening the link between infection and serious illness.  ONS data shows the number of deaths involving coronavirus occurring in the UK each week has remained mostly below 1,000 since early last year, peaking at between 1,000 and 2,000 whenever infection rates have jumped. People with symptoms are no longer advised to test, while access to free checks is limited to a small part of the population. This means that data based just on positive tests is not likely to reflect the true prevalence of the virus in the community or the real level of mortality.
