Members of the Aslef union walked out in a dispute over pay, causing five of the scheduled six Hull intercity services to be wiped from the timetable. And train cleaners were on the picket lines in the final day of a three-day strike, also over pay. The cleaners belonging to the RMT union are employed by contractors, including Churchill, on GTR, Network Rail, HS1 and South East Trains. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: "These cleaners went over and above during the pandemic to keep our trains and stations safe and hygienic. "Churchill could easily afford to give them Â£15 an hour but instead they're fixed on shovelling money toward their private equity shareholders." Unions have argued strike action was the only option after train companies failed to make a pay offer to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living.  Strikes are planned for Hull Trains and Greater Anglia next weekend. Greater Anglia will run a heavily reduced service on Saturday, followed by major engineering works the next day. Its managing director, Jamie Burles, said: "Negotiations to try to resolve the pay issue causing the strikes are continuing at an industry level and we hope we can resolve this situation soon." Drivers at Arriva Rail London, Chiltern Railways, Greater Anglia, Great Western, Hull Trains, LNER, Southeastern and West Midlands Trains will walk out on Saturday July 30. And RMT members at 14 train companies and Network Rail, which includes signallers, conductors, inspectors and station staff, are to strike for 24 hours on Wednesday July 27.
