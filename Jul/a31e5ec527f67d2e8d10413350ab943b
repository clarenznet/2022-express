The firm insisted there is no direct risk to customers' water supply but insisted the hosepipe ban was important. Dr Alison Hoyle, director of risk and compliance at Southern Water, said: “We’re experiencing one of the driest years on record for over a century and we’ve seen record temperatures. River flows are approximately 25 percent lower than they should be for July, which is equivalent to losing more than 25 million bathtubs of water." She went on: “We're asking our customers to help protect our rivers and the habitats that live there by cutting back their water use. “We believe a temporary use ban is a responsible and vital step to reducing the amount of water being taken from the Rivers Test and Itchen.” Customers will be banned from using hose pipes to water gardens or clean cars, while ornamental ponds and swimming pools must not be filled. Dr Hoyle said: We haven’t taken this decision lightly and we know the Temporary Use Ban will have an impact on our customers. “We’re working with the Environment Agency to ensure that we act responsibly to protect our environment. “We’re asking everyone in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight to do their bit by supporting these measures and only use the water that they need.” The Met Office said this week that January to June this year was the driest period in England since 1976. The National Drought Group met on Tuesday to discuss a strategy to deal with exceptionally dry conditions across the whole of England. This meeting was planned to take place in October but the potential drought conditions forced an earlier meeting. An Environment Agency spokesman said: “Southern Water’s announcement of a temporary-use ban for its customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight is one of many measures they and other water companies should consider to reduce unnecessary use of water and protect customer supplies and the environment.”
