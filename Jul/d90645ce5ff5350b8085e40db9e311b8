Little Kane Davidson was playing with his brother at home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when he became trapped on January 28. The one-year-old died several days later at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Last week, a coroner heard how the tot suffered a cardiac arrest caused by asphyxiation and hypoxic brain injury. At the hearing at Rochdale Coroner's Court on Friday, July 15, coroner Dr Edward Morgan ruled that Kane's death was "accidental", reports Manchester Evening News. Kane's mum Natasha Ogden said she now wants to warn other parents about the dangers of blind cords and young children. "It's something you think will never happen to you," she explained. "It's something you read in the news or magazines. "You might not see it as a danger but you need to make sure you tie them away from your children. It's not mandatory for them to be checked but it should be." Paying tribute to her beloved son, Natasha said: "Kane made the family. He was really cheeky and happy all the time. "He was just the happiest little boy you would ever meet. Batman was his favourite. As soon as he smiled, everybody else would." Natasha has previously spoken of her heartbreak after finding her son entangled in the blind cord after leaving him alone for just seconds while she went to the bathroom. In February she said there was no fitting on the wall to tie the blind cords up with and that she believes Kane may have climbed onto the windowsill while "messing about" and slipped. Upon finding her son, her harrowing screams were heard by a neighbour who helped perform CPR while waiting for paramedics to arrive. By the time Kane was transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital, it was already too late as he had suffered brain trauma and was put into a coma. His injuries were so severe he had little chance of surviving. There was nothing more doctors could do. Natasha and Kane’s father, Callum Davidson, made the agonising decision to switch off his life-support machine on February 1.
