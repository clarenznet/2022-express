Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo will reportedly hold a meeting with new boss Erik ten Hag today to discuss his future. The Red Devils have been one of the most intriguing stories to follow during the summer transfer window, and Ten Hag still needs several more additions to ensure his squad is ready for their Premier League season opener against Brighton on August 7. United have made three signings so far under Ten Hag but must resolve the future of star striker Ronaldo. Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Christian Eriksen have all joined the club. But Ten Hag has made it clear that he needs more than just those three if United are to start the season well. Frenkie de Jong has long been strongly linked, while forwards Antony from Ajax and Benjamin Sesko are rumoured to be of interest. Several players could also leave United in the coming weeks. Ten Hag is desperate to reshape his squad and has insisted that only players who are fully committed can remain. FOLLOW ALL THE LATEST MAN UTD NEWS BELOW
