By the 1990s The Beatles had seen and done it all in the music industry. So when they were asked their opinions about new, up-and-coming bands, they would not go easy on anyone. And in 1994 Oasis were put under the microscope by two members of the Fab Four, and they were not going to sugar-coat their opinions. Oasis, at the time in the mid-1990s, were extremely popular. Their debut album, Definitely Maybe, hit number one on the UK album charts before grabbing another number one a year later with (What's the Story) Morning Glory? This record included Wonderwall, the band's biggest song to date. Naturally, as a young, working-class band from the midlands, Oasis were quickly compared to The Beatles. But when George Harrison was quizzed about them and the comparison he wasn't so sure about the band. He said Oasis' "music lacks depth" before hitting out at the band's frontman, Liam Gallagher. Harrison went on: "The singer, Liam, is a pain. The rest of the band don’t need him ... he's a bit out of date. I feel a bit sorry for him." He added: "He's just excess baggage, I think." Paul McCartney was also asked about Oasis at around the same time. The Hey Jude singer was equally as dismissive of the band. He said: "They’re derivative and they think too much of themselves. They mean nothing to me." READ MORE: The Beatles: Paul McCartney on first meeting ‘posh’ John Lennon Gallagher was not happy at all. He had grown up listening to and loving The Beatles, so this was quite a gut punch to him. Gallagher lashed out at the band to MTV: "If any of them old farts have got a problem with me, then they should leave their Zimmer frames at home and I’ll hold them up with a good right hook." He followed this up by praising Harrison and the music he had released in his glory days.

But as a person, I think he’s a f*****g nipple." He added: "If I ever meet him I'll f*****g tell him. And if you’re watching, [you're a] nipple!" The Wonderwall singer then blamed Harrison's view of him on how he had been portrayed in the newspapers. Gallagher said: "It's so f*****g stupid because he’s the silly one because he reads the press." He added: "How’s he know I'm silly? I'm not silly. He only reads the press, you know what I mean? So he’s the f*****g silly one." Gallagher had a particular connection with Harrison as his biggest song, Wonderwall, was named after the Beatle's solo album "Wonderwall Music". SOURCE
