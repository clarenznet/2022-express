Janette Manrara, 38, joined a number of celebrity guests at Silverstone today to visit Williams Racing. The It Takes Two host stunned in tight blue jeans and a silk cream blouse. She partnered the outfit with booted heels and a black leather jacket. The dancer was joined by her husband Aljaz Skorjanez along with other stars including her co-presenter Rylan Clark. Janette was ecstatic to see Rylan as she posed for pictures during an embrace, with Rylan touching her bottom.
