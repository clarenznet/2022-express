Students at Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, had to study remotely today as a result of the travellers being on the school's land. Oakgrove's management hopes that the school will be able to reopen tomorrow. The school, which is run by the Kingsbridge Educational Trust, issued a short statement on its website on Sunday. A spokesperson said on the website the school was shut due to "unforeseen circumstances". However, a spokesperson told Buckinghamshire Live that travellers gained entry to the school grounds on Friday.  There are two Traveller sites in Milton Keynes, situated at Calverton Road in Calverton and Willen Road in Willen. However, neither have transit pitches for the traveller community to stop at legitimately and only have 18 residential pitches between them. An Oakgrove School spokesperson said: "A group from the travelling community entered the Oakgrove Secondary School site on Friday 8 July. "The school informed the relevant authorities.  "In line with the school’s safeguarding policy, parents and staff were advised that Oakgrove will be closed on Monday 11 July. "Arrangements have been made for the students to work remotely. "It is hoped that the school will re-open tomorrow. The school will keep parents and students updated." It comes as Travellers forced the closure of a cafe and play area in Cornwall. After being made to leave the area, the Travellers angered residents by moving just a few miles away in the same town. Michelle Gavin, Development Manager at the charity Friends, Families and Travellers said: "There is a national chronic under-provision of suitable and safe stopping places for Romany or Traveller people passing through. "More safe stopping places such as transit pitches are needed. "No one wants their living situation to become a spectacle – everyone deserves the right to privacy."
