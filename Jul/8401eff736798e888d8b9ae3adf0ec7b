Marvel Studios have dropped their biggest info dump in three years at their panel at San Diego Comic-Con. Following The Infinity Saga (Phases 1-3) that made up the first decade of MCU movies from Iron Man to Avengers Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home, Kevin Feige has announced The Multiverse Saga (Phases 4-6), which began with WandaVision in 2021 and will conclude with Phase 6's Avengers 5 and 6 in 2025 - that’s two Avengers extravaganzas in one year! Phase 4 will end this year with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in November, which has seen its first trailer released, along with the next Disney+ miniseries’ latest teaser for She-Hulk. Phase 5 is set to kick off in February 2023 with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania, which will debut Jonathan Majors’ villain Kang the Conqueror. He’s a time-travelling despot from the future, a descendent of Fantastic Four’s Reed Richards, who will be The Multiverse Saga’s Thanos, via his various variants. We met one already in He Who Remains, who secretly ran the Time Variance Authority in Loki before being killed by Sylvie. We’d expect some of alternate selves to be evil and others to join the Avengers to battle him, just like in the comics. The first footage for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was shown for those lucky enough to be at Comic-Con, featuring a deeper dive into the Quantum Realm, the first look at Kang, the MCU introduction of MODOK and even Bill Murray in a role. Next up, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was teased by director James Gunn and the cast who were tearing up in emotion after working on the trilogy with him. Those who saw the first footage said they were welling up at flashbacks of young Rocket, who seems to be the focus of the final outing for this gang of misfits. Another big surprise was Daredevil: Born Again, a continuation of Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock adventures against Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin in what will be an 18-episode series.

And then there’s Thunderbolts to close out Phase 5, who are an anti-hero team who will probably be a bit like Suicide Squad with the likes of Florence Pugh's Yelena and Wyatt Russell's US Agent. Feige then surprised the audience with news of Phase 6, teasing, three titles starting with the opener which will be Fantastic Four. No cast announcement just yet, but expect more MCU news at the Marvel panel at D23 in September to fill in the gaps of this and what wasn't revealed today. Then came the biggest news.

The first will be called Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which takes its name from the comic book of the same name when the time travelling despot attempted to conquer the world. The follow-up, assuming he gets the upper hand like Thanos in Avengers Infinity War, will be Avengers: Secret Wars. In the comics, this storyline saw the Marvel multiverse collide with multiple variants of superheroes. Expect an extravaganza bigger than Avengers Endgame.
