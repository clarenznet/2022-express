More than 60 of the tropical and "mesmerising" 3cm-wide sea snails have hit beaches on the Isles of Scilly - likely visiting to feed on sea life enjoying our warmer waters. Scott Reid, 32, from Scilly Rockpool Safaris, said he has seen them before but "never to this extent". He explained that the purple wonders float by creating a "raft of bubbles". Usually at home nearer the equator, they feed on jellyfish and similar creatures called by-the-wind-sailors. Scott added: "The snails ingest the toxins of the stinging cells in jellyfish."
