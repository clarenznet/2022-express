The man was left stranded hundreds of feet up in the air between two skyscrapers in downtown Toronto, Canada as onlookers watched in horror. As he hangs below a load of construction materials, he can be heard screaming out in terror as the crane slowly lowers. The shocking video, reportedly captured by the man's colleagues was later posted on social media. "Hang on!" an onlooker can be heard in encouragement. Another bystander can be heard asking: "Oh my God, how the f*** did this happen?" At one point during the descent, the man's hard hat comes loose and plummets to the ground below. Nearing the ground, onlookers appear concerned the man will be  crushed by the crane's heavy load, yelling for the driver to "Stop!" The footage ends before the man lands safely back on the ground but he is reported to have suffered no serious injury. The construction company in charge of the site later confirmed that an "incident took place" while work was carried out on Tuesday. The worker's hand was "entangled with a tagline after hooking a load," PCL Constructors Canada Inc. said in the statement.  "Fortunately, he was safely lowered to the work surface and not seriously injured," added the spokesperson. Emergency services were not called out to respond to the incident, according to the Canadian news outlet CBC. Meanwhile, Ontario's labour ministry has sent an inspector to the site to investigate, with PCL "working with all appropriate authorities." The labour ministry said: "It was reported that a worker became entangled with a tag line from a crane after hooking a load, was hoisted off the podium level and sustained injuries."
