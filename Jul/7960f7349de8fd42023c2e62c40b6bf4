Emily Ratajkowski, 31, took a stroll with her dog in New York City on Friday. The brunette wore a cropped white vest and low-rise jeans that put her incredible abs on display. Emily looked glum as she walked with her German Shepherd. She noticeably was not wearing her wedding ring and wore sunglasses that covered her eyes. The model was also seen without her ring while walking with her son on Thursday. Emily married her husband of four-years, Sebastian Bear-McClard, in 2018 and they share a one-year-old son, Sylvester Apollo Bear. He is a film producer best known for the movies Uncut Gems and Good Time.
