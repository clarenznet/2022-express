The couple enjoyed semi-final day in the Royal Box at the tennis tournament as they showed off their royal style credentials - dressing in some stunning outfits to enjoy a day of tennis. Beatrice, 33, wore a gorgeous pink and white floral dress by The Vampire's Wife, said to be one of her favourite brands, completing the look with a basket handbag from Zara and a pair of sunglasses.  The dress, worth £550, is a Falconetti floral-print ruffled silk dress finished just above the knee, with the ruffled sleeves reaching the princess' elbows. Edoardo on the other hand looked very dapper wearing a white blazer, light blue shirt, and bottle green tie - which he paired with some navy blue trousers and a pair of sunglasses. But at one point during the day, the pair could be seen sharing a look of love as they smiled at each other while applauding the ongoing tennis. Fans of the princess took to social media to praise Beatrice's style at Wimbledon on Friday.  Posting on Instagram, one person commented: “Princess Beatrice is looking stunning.” Another person referred to both Beatrice and Edo, saying “Lovely couple!” while a third agreed, writing: “They are fabulous.” A Twitter user KiloEcho commented: “Bea looks beautiful.” Another Twitter user Lisa_vinl said: “She looks very pretty!
