The 91-year-old sported a black and white shirt as he talked animatedly about his new book, Boldly Go: Reflections on a Life of Awe and Wonder. The popular Star Trek actor appeared healthy and energetic as The One Show hosts Alex Jones and Roman Kemp questioned him on his book, a new series of his show and his recent space experience. Viewers tuned in to BBC One found it hard to concentrate on what the iconic actor was saying though, thanks to his youthful appearance. As he chatted about a new series of his mystery-exploring show, The UnXplained, The One Show fans were staggered to realise Shatner is 91 years old. "We're surrounded by questions," he explained. "Some of these questions we ask, and as you pointed out, it's inexplicable. "There's no explanation except the grandeur of the mystery." It seems William was enjoying his conversation with the BBC presenters a bit too much though, and Alex made a quip about his chatty nature.

"Don't you understand, this is all about space!" William replied excitedly. "Yes, it's all connected, all part of the same thing," Alex replied. She added: "We need to get you back on so we can talk about what it was like - William Shatner, you're our new guru - we love you!" Roman laughed as Shatner dismissed his queue to exit and continued to chat. Skewing the goodbye, the actor replied: "I think you have to, to talk about all the various, wonderous things, all of which are very mysterious, and go along with the unexplained." After thanking him and saying goodbye, Alex joked: "Well, that's all we've got time for tonight," before adding: "No, I'm only joking." Fans of the show quickly took to social media to comment on their surprise over William's appearance.

TheTeoThree remarked: "William Shatner (Captain Kirk) on #TheOneShow tonight looking brilliant at the age of 91." Some found the presenter's comments to William "rude" though, with @JosephHankey stating: "How rude. Sorry @WilliamShatner but the @BBCTheOneShow of @BBCOne presenters were rude and patronising to you, which they aren’t to anyone else. "Maybe it’s because you weren’t talking about something the @BBC cares about eg Net Zero or Left-Wing politics. How sad…. #OneShow." (sic) The One Show airs weekdays from 7pm on BBC One.
