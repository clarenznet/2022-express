Amanda Holden has shared a jaw-dropping clip of herself stripping down to swimwear as she continues to enjoy her holiday abroad. The HeartFM radio host, 51, flaunted her phenomenally toned physique as she went for a dip in a stunning infinity pool. In the clip, Amanda walked seductively up a path as she removed her black shirt and matching sarong. The star revealed a tiny black bikini which showcasedÂ her washboard abs and toned limbs as she continued to perfect her flawless tan abroad. After stepping out of the beachwear, the mother-of-two loped towards the crystal-blue swimming pool before posing gracefully into the water.
