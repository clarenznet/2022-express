The man in his 70s, who doesn't want to be named, has lived on Ling Lane in posh Scarcroft, Leeds, for 10 years and has noticed "there isn't a neighbourly atmosphere" on the street. The average property price on the road is £1,551,000, according to recent research by Halifax. The pensioner told Leeds Live: "I’ve lived here for about 10 years. I moved here from LS16 (Bramhope, Leeds). There isn’t any neighbourly atmosphere around here, no one ever speaks to anyone else because they’re rich." Many of the properties on the affluent street, which connects A58 with rural roads in the west, come complete with swimming pools and gyms. Most mansions are gated and have large gardens at both the front and rear of the building. But Mohammed Nazir, 38, who has lived on the road for five years, said he doesn't know his neighbours' names. The marketing boss added: "They like to keep themselves to themselves. "It’s okay, it’s friendly. You get a lot of dog walkers and cyclists. They’re friendly, you have a chitchat and everything." However, the father of three, who moved his family to the street from nearby Alwoodley, Leeds, said the street has problems with speeding drivers occasionally. "We do get the odd boy racer but that’s with every road, you can’t say it’s used as a speeding track," Mr Nazir said. "It’s the older generation that are driving the expensive cars. The youngsters are driving normal cars, it’s the 40s, 50s and even 60s that have got the super cars." Ling Lane was the fourth most expensive street in Leeds, according to research in 2018. The priciest street on which to buy a house in Leeds then was Roundhay Park Lane, between nearby Roundhay and Shadwell.
