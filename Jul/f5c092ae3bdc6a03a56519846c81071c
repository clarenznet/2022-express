Kim Kardashian, 41, arrived in the French capital for Paris Fashion Week with her latest look of bleached blonde tresses, while dressed head to toe in high fashion brand Balenciaga. The star boasted a chic outfit of black boots and leggings, with a curve-enhancing black bodysuit slipped over the top. For those wondering what connection Californian Kim might have with the small market town of Barnsley in Yorkshire, it was one of the first tour dates for the band Speedhunters, which were all listed over her famous derriere. Speedhunters is an imaginary group created by the label for its Fashion Week 2018 collection, inspired by rock bands' concert merchandise. The tour dates were inspired by locations where members of Balenciaga's team originated from, and Kim's bodysuit featured each one written on her rear.
