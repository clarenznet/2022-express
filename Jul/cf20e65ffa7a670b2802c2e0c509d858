Helen Skelton, 38, looked fabulous yesterday as she posed for a picture ahead of the penultimate instalment of Summer on the Farm. In a picture shared in view of her 308,000 followers, Helen sat cross-legged as she gave the camera a broad smile. The presenter donned a summery outfit consisting of a short, light denim playsuit and some black two-strap sandals, which she accessorised with gold hoop earrings. The Countryfile star put her long, blonde tresses in a half updo and opted for a bold eyeliner look, paired with an intense red lip, as she updated fans on the beloved Channel 5 series.
