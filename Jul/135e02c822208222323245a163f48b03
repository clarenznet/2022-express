Kate Middleton pulled out all the stops for the last day of Wimbledon. She was snapped waving at the crowds in an elegant blue and white gown. The Duchess looked marvellous as she stepped out to attend Wimbledon today. She had Prince William and Prince George in tow looking dapper as ever. Kate opted for an ankle-length dress.

The dress also featured a beautiful bow, in the same navy and white polka dot pattern. As opposed to falling straight below the waist, the Duchess' dress featured a unique peplum style. This made the creation look much like a skirt and blouse. To accessorise, the Duchess donned the same two-tone slingback pumps she wore on day nine of Wimbledon on July 5. Sustainable Kate is known to often recycle her outfits. The chic white pumps, which feature a chic black toe, are reportedly from Alessandra Rich. As for jewellery, Kate of course wore her stunning sapphire engagement ring. The Ceylon stone perfectly complemented the tone of the dress.

As for hair and makeup, Kate wore her enviable dark tresses down in a pretty curly do. The natural beauty went for a dewy look, a sweep of pink lipstick and a subtle swipe of pink eyeshadow. Prince George was her mini-me in a smart navy suit. This is not the first time the Duchess has gone for a polka dot look at Wimbledon. On July 5, Kate wore the Azure Blue Polka Dot dress by Alessandra Rich. Polka dots are clearly working for the fashionable royal. Royal fans have taken to Instagram to praise Kate's latest style choice. @vodolija.89 said: "I love that dress." @christinamariefla added: "She is just timeless!" @mywonderluxelife stated: "She’s never looked better."
