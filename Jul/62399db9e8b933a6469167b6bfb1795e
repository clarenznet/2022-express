Damiano David, from Eurovision-winning band Maneskin, looked drastically different from the gothic rocker we saw on stage last year in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The 23-year-old looked casual and relaxed as he supported the beautiful Giorgia, 26, who recently released a book of her poetry. Damiano wore a white t-shirt tucked into some pinstriped trousers. Giorgia looked every inch the Disney princess in a long pink gown with puffy sleeves and a sweetheart neckline, matching her daring eye makeup to the fuchsia hue. The pair were seen walking hand in hand before cuddling up to one another as they walked the streets of Rome, Italy.
