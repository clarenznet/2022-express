It has been more than four years since Croydon Council granted the Premier League club planning permission to increase the capacity of their 26,000-seater venue by a further 8,000. An estimated completion date was set for the start of the 2021-22 season, but that was before the pandemic and Palace have, in the meantime, built a new academy base, which cost an estimated £20million. Palace's original planning application with Croydon Council from 2018 remains live but, as a result of changes to planning policy in the London Plan, the club have been forced to adhere to new measures such as fire-safety regulations, energy requirements and urban greening.  Chairman Steve Parish said: "The Selhurst Park redevelopment will exceed £100m of investment and I'm sure supporters can appreciate the scale, complexity and enormity of this project, but it is something we are absolutely committed to. "We very much hope to make significant progress in the coming months."
