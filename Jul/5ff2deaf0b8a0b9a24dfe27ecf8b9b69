 The cleft palate is a birth defect which means he has already stopped breathing in the night several times. Lyndsey said: "I'm scared that, if he gets too excited, his airway could completely close. Every day we do our best to keep him calm which, for a boy like Ernest, isn't easy."  The mum-of-two from Sandycroft, Flintshire, said Ernest was "like a two-year-old boy" and "a real character".  She said: "Part of his charm comes from the fact that he cannot smell very well due to his deformity, meaning he gets up-close with people and objects - nuzzling them in an attempt to get their smell.  He's always getting into stuff."    While Ernest's condition has not been a major obstacle for much of his life, it is now causing potentially fatal sleep apnea. Launching her campaign, Lyndsey wrote: "My name is Ernest or, as my mum calls me, potato. As you can see, my little palate didn’t form properly when I was a pup. I was the smallest of my brothers and sisters and it was hard for me to keep up with them. "I need surgery on my nose and my palate. This will help me breathe properly so I can do zoomies around the garden and have a good night's sleep." There are several factors that can increase the risk of cleft lip in puppies, says Animal Trust, including genetic factors, exposure to certain toxins, and poor nutrition during foetal development.
