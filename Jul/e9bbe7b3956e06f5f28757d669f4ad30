Laura Nuttall quit her London university course to focus on a “bucket list” of wishes after an eye test in 2018 found she had incurable brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme.  Car Share star Kay, 49, has suffered adversity – he quit showbiz in December 2017 over “unforeseen family circumstances.” But last year, he staged a fundraiser at Manchester’s O2 Apollo, enabling Laura to fly to Cologne, Germany, for immunotherapy treatment every six weeks. This week, Laura, now 22, from Barrowford, Lancs, graduated from Manchester University with a 2:1 in politics, philosophy and economics. Laura, an ambassador for The Brain Tumour Charity, said: “In my first year, I wasn’t sure if I would be able to make it to graduation, never mind get a 2:1.”  Her university lecturer, Professor Jackie Carter, who has a child with an incurable brain tumour, said: “Unlike most of my students who are wondering what to do with their futures, Laura quite literally doesn’t know what hers holds. But she’s getting on with it with a spirit that shines through her every pore.” Laura’s mum Nicola, 52, said she, husband Mark and Laura’s sister Gracie, 20, “couldn’t be prouder.” She said her graduation was “a real celebration of her tenacity.” Since creating her bucket list, Laura has met celebrities including former US first lady Michelle Obama, piloted a Royal Navy patrol boat and driven a supercar around Silverstone.
