 The pair took to social media prior to Sunday's final. During an Instagram chat, the two tennis stars agreed to go for a meal after the grand slam final with the winner footing the bill. There seems to be a blossoming “bromance” between the pair, with Djokovic saying, "it took you five years to say something nice about me". Kyrgios responded and said: “But I defended you when it mattered.” To which Djokovic replied: “You did, I appreciate that.” Then Kyrgios asked: “We friends now?” And, Djokovic added: “If you are inviting me for a drink or dinner, I accept. PS winner of tomorrow pays.” Kyrgios sealed the deal and said: “Deal, let’s go to a nightclub and go nuts.”
