  Phillip shared videos of their day out in the sun to his Instagram a few days ago in view of his three million followers. "That was a lovely day,” he wrote, panning around the river with his trainer visible in the background. He continued to explain: “Three hour full upper body workout! I'm going to feel it tomorrow." Phillip also shared a selfie of himself and his hunky trainer with the cheeky caption: “My trainer... or the torturer.”
