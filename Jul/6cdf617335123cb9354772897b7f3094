Sharon Stone, 64, made a jaw-dropping appearance yesterday as she stepped out for the Dolce & Gabbana haute couture men's fashion show. The Basic Instinct star appeared in great spirits as she waved at fans while wearing the unique lemon jumpsuit, which featured a long train and a black belt that cinched her svelte waist. Sharon complemented the look with oversized drop earrings and a bold red lip, slicking her hair back to put the opulent jewellery on full display. She had left fans stunned once again hours before the outing, as she took to Instagram to share a video posing alongside Dame Helen Mirren, 76 - with the pair looking ageless in their elegant floor-length gowns.
