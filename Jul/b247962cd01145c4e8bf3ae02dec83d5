Christine McGuinness smiled as she posed for a photo in a stunning location today. The mum-of-three looked radiant in a pair of denim shorts, but behind her smile was a “heartbreaker” of a day. She posted a video of her flat tyre, claiming it “just sums up my life right now”. Posting another photo on a hilltop, she added: “Today was a heartbreaker though,” alongside a broken heart emoji. On the next slide, Christine wrote: “I actually love my car! Like, really love it, it’s my happy place, my freedom, my music…” She continued: “I already feel lost without it… miss you already”. Her posts come as she admitted she and Paddy had been through “difficult times” in their relationship, though she denied reports they had split.
