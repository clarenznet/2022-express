Boris Johnson’s premiership is in crisis after 31 ministers and other figures quit the Government in the space of just 24 hours. The deluge of resignations began on Tuesday with the departure of Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak. The Health Secretary and Chancellor claimed they no longer had confidence in the Prime Minister’s leadership. Their resignations, within minutes of one another, came after Mr Johnson admitted he had made a “bad mistake” in appointing former Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip. Sir Bernard hit out at the Prime Minister in February amid the so-called Partygate scandal over social gatherings held in Downing Street that broke England’s COVID-19 lockdown rules. Speaking about Mr Johnson to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, he said: “He has got to sort this out. “We are interested not in the optics, in some impression of a reset. “We are looking for a change in the capability and the character of the Government. “So that we can have confidence that nothing as clumsy or mortifying as this Partygate episode could ever happen again.” The MP vowed not to “pull any punches” after he was appointed chair of the committee in May 2020. Speaking to Politics Home at the time, he dismissed criticism from other MPs that he would fail to hold the Government to account in his new role. He said: “I think their concern about that is entirely understandable, but if the Prime Minister and the chief whip suggested me on that basis, they’ve decided to nominate the wrong man. “I’m answerable to the committee and the House. I’m not beholden to anyone else.” He said his appointment may have been because he is viewed “as a safe pair of hands” given his experience in chairing committees. He added: “If I didn’t feel I was independent and if I didn’t feel I was a capable committee chair, then I wouldn’t be doing it.”
