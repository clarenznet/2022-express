There has been just 0.6 inches of rain averaged across England, just 24 per cent of the amount expected in an average July, according to data. The Met Office said it would have expected three-quarters of the month’s average rain to have fallen by this point.  Across the UK it has been the driest July since 1984, with a rain average of 1.5 inches, and the eighth driest since 1836. Prof Liz Bentley of the Royal Meteorological Society said: “The report is clear – we are seeing a change in our climate.”
