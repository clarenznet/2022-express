Rod Stewart, 77, showed the world he's still got what it takes when he brought out all of his best moves while performing in Toronto last night. The husband of model Penny Lancaster stunned in a sparkling suit as he took the stage by storm. He combined his white shirt with a sparkly silver trouser suit and matching sequin trainers. The star is being accompanied on his North American tour by his wife Penny. The pair were seen out together enjoying a meal at luxury hotel The Ned NoMad in New York last week, along with two of Rod's sons and Penny's niece.
