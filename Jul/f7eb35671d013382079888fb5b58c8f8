  Michael, 46, took to Instagram to sing the praises of head chef Aktar Islam and quipped that he would be “dreaming about him” that night. The star told his fans: "Tonight in Birmingham, my friend Aktar closed down one of the great restaurants in the world, called Opheem, and he's closed it down just for me and my family, come and check this out. "Ten years ago, I came to his first restaurant and fell in love. “And here we are, years later and I'm in love again. Give me a kiss."
