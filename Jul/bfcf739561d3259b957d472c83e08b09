Jake Paul has claimed he tried to get in MMA stars as last-minute replacements for Tommy Fury. However, he claimed the proposed opponents were rejected by the New York State Athletic Commission. The American was forced to look for a new opponent due to the 2019 Love Island runner-up being unable to enter the US before the scheduled fight waa called off for a second time. The 26-year-old eventually came to an agreement to fight Hasim Rahman Jr, but not before several applications to fight MMA fighters were made. The commission began to fear for Paul's health and inexperience when his team presented the names of boxers. They eventually approved Rahman Jr after some persuasion from the YouTuber’s camp. "They [the NYSAC] drove it a lot," Paul told Morning Kombat. "There were certain names that they wouldn't approve, mostly MMA fighters. Then we were like 'alright we need a professional boxer'. But it sort of reversed because they were like 'we don't know if we're going to approve Jake for this'.

This is insane, this is psychotic, no boxer is taking chances like this as early on in their career." Rahman Jr will be the first boxer Paul will face inside the ring, after contesting his previous fights against a fellow Youtuber, a retired NBA star and two MMA veterans.   “It’s not anything that I don’t know as far as the situation. They called me originally for sparring. They tried to set me up with like, ‘Hey, what you doing? Where’s your weight?’ They tried hitting me with the okey-doke. “Then an hour it was like, ‘Oh, we want to fight. We’re not bringing you in for sparring, we want to fight you’. So it’s nothing that I didn’t see coming.” The pair will square off at Madison Square Garden on August 6.
