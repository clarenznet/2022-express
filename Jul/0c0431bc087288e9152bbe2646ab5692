Soloviev was queried on Italian live TV over why, if Moscow is interested in Donbas, the region made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, forces are attacking Kharkiv and going south to reach Odesa. He asks: "Where do you want to go? What is your goal?" The Kremlin propagandist replies: "To Transnistria, to be precise." Soloviev, a sanctioned oligarch, then tries to ramble on, but the host stops him, saying: "No, no, no, wait – this is interesting." He points at the several territories that have come under attack since February 24 until reaching Transnistria — an unofficial breakaway state internationally recognised as part of Moldova — and claims: "So, you want to take all this area of Ukraine to arrive here. Then, the Donbas has nothing to do with it. It is just an excuse." Soloviev remains quiet. In a challenging tone, the host adds: "You want half of Ukraine. You want to take the Black Sea from Ukraine. Do you think that Ukraine will allow this? Do you think that we — Italians, Europeans, NATO members — can allow such a situation? It is frankly impossible."
