Boris Becker faces automatic deportation from the United Kingdom once he has served his prison sentence for fraud, according to reports. The Wimbledon icon is serving two-and-a-half years in jail after being found guilty of concealing £2.5million worth of assets after declaring bankruptcy. The Home Office has confirmed that Becker is eligible to be deported from the UK as a foreign national who has served a prison sentence of more than 12 months behind bars. The three-times Wimbledon champion was initially detained at Wandsworth Prison in South London but was moved to HMP Huntercombe, Oxfordshire, in late May. Becker was handed a two-and-a-half year sentence in April after he was found guilty of concealing £2.5m in assets after declaring bankruptcy. A decade earlier, he had been handed a suspended setence of two years for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth £1.4m in Germany. John McEnroe and Sue Barker were both criticised for referencing former BBC pundit Becker during the broadcaster's coverage of Wimbledon this year. “Boris is a friend of mine. This is just horrible," McEnroe said. "I want to see him if I possibly can and if he’s willing to see people. I just feel terrible. He’s one of the greatest players that ever played the game. He’s been going through a lot for a long time. He kept telling me it’s going to be OK, it’s under control. That’s Boris.” McEnroe said during commentary of a match later in the tournament: “Boris, we love you. We miss you, man.” Barker, who ended her 30-year reign as the BBC's lead Wimbledon presenter, added: “We do indeed.” Becker's potential deportation means that he will not be involved in the coverage of Wimbledon again.
