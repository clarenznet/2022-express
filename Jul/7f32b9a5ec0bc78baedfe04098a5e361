The Normal People star, 24, who is from north London, portrays Catherine "Kya" Clark in the movie adaptation of the best-selling book of the same title. It tells the story of an abandoned girl who raises herself in a North Carolina marsh before falling in love with two men when she is brought into a town. Daisy says mastering the accent of the American South was helped by playing word games with her parents as a child. She explained: "I grew up with a lot of accents in the house. My mum is from the north of Ireland, my dad's Scottish, and then my Grandad and my cousin Jacklyn came to live with me when I was wee and they had a very, very strong accent too. "Then my mum will always put on wee characters and my dad will too, and we'll talk in accents with each other. Then I grew up in London so there was quite a north London accent which I'd sometimes pick up. It definitely was a real advantage to have grown up with accents."  Daisy worked with dialect coaches to perfect the tone, admitting "it certainly was" nerve-racking performing in front of the film's producer Reese Witherspoon, who is from Louisiana. She said: "I had been feeling quite confident and when she came I felt I have got to try and make sure I can stay in it. "It was so surreal for me as I grew up watching Reese. I have always been such a huge admirer of hers, especially with what she is doing, because she wants to put complicated women at the forefront of her stories."
