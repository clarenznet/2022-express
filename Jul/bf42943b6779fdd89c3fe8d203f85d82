Adele, 34, looked incredible as she performed at the BST Hyde Park Festival today. The singer bared her shoulders in a low-cut black velvet gown, as she put on the vocal performance of a lifetime. This comes as she was forced to cancel her Las Vegas residency back in January, infuriating some fans who had splashed out on flights and hotels. While the mum-of-one may not be ready for her Vegas shows yet, she took to the stage in London and delivered on her promise to “blow fans’ socks off”. “The line up for my Hyde Park shows next week is going to blow your socks off!!” she tweeted last week. "An all female bill, from new artists that I'm obsessed with to the heavenly @spaceykacey to one of my favourite artists of all time @gabrielleuk who I've loved since I was 4!! “It's going to be incredible, there's a whole host of us performing all day, I can't wait to share the main stage with you ladies.”
