Jumping to conclusions might come a little easier today. The eccentric Aquarius Moon squaring stubborn Uranus in Taurus could prompt increased impulsivity, which might lead to hasty moves and rapid mood swings. Paired with the Venus inconjunct Pluto, extra care should be taken while deciding your approach today. Express.co.uk reveals your horoscope, star sign reading, astrology and zodiac forecast for July 15. Uranus will be transiting in Taurus until April 2026 and during this cycle - which began in May 2018 - typically Taurian matters are vastly influenced. These include aspects such as money, beauty, sustainability, and values. When squared with the Moon - especially one transiting in Aquarius - patience is more likely to dwindle and anything requiring commitment or focus will be put on the backburner.

Cafe Astrology said: “We can be more invested in our friendships, connections, and happiness goals.” Although, the tone is due to turn slightly more stern as the day progresses when the Moon aligns with Saturn. Cafe Astrology said it will bring “a serious, responsible, ambitious tone to later today”. Situations that require us to keep a cool head work best under this influence since we’re not easily swept away by our feelings, thanks to the hard-headed Aquarius transit.
