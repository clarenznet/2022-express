The book begins with Anna and Fin on a gruesome holiday with their exes and children - the first of many hilarious set pieces. Unable to endure it, the pair vamoose, and start poking their noses into the disappearance of a young woman involved in the discovery of a long-lost ancient artefact - a sealed casket that may contain proof of Christ's resurrection. As Anna and Fin hare up and down Europe entangling themselves in conspiracies and coincidences, this romp unfolds as a glorious spoof of The Da Vinci Code.  But, although there's a laugh on nearly every page, it's not short on thrills - and it makes serious points about religious faith, and the current trade in artefacts that is seeing much of our common heritage disappear into the vaults of the super-rich.
