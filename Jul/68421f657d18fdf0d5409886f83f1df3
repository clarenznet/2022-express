Manchester United play again today with their penultimate pre-season friendly against Atletico Madrid. But as well as the action on the pitch, there's plenty going on with United off it as they continue to try and strengthen Erik ten Hag's first-team squad for the exhaustive World Cup-interrupted Premier League season ahead. Namely, the drawn-out pursuit of Ten Hag's No 1 summer target - Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong - continues. The basics of a deal are agreed between United and Barcelona for De Jong and the Dutchman would cost up to Â£71million including add-ons. But De Jong prefers to stay in Spain although Barca are eager for the player to take a pay cut to do so. Elsewhere, Red Bull Salzburg striker Benjamin Sesko has emerged as a target. The teenage forward scored in a friendly against Liverpool earlier this week and is one of the next major talents off of the long Salzburg production line, but will not come cheaply if Ten Hag is to add him to his team. Sesko is a target for United with Cristiano Ronaldo's future up in the air. The Portuguese superstar is eager to quit the Red Devils but United do not want to leave themselves with Anthony Martial as their only striker, with Marcus Rashford now very much a winger. Ronaldo has made it clear to United he wants out but there are few clubs who can afford a deal. Express Sport keeps you updated on all the latest goings on at Old Trafford below.
