Jane Seymour, 71, looked sensational as she flaunted her flexible figure during a Pilates class - and despite having entered her eighth decade of life, appeared incredibly youthful. The sparkly-eyed acting legend waved her legs in the air as she practised her fitness in an all-black yoga leggings and crop top ensemble. Her work-out location looked idyllic, with the Malibu sea reflecting onto the nearby window. Earlier this week, the Bond girl also shared a snap of herself frolicking in the water in a cobalt blue sarong and seemingly having the time of her life. The star shared with her followers that she could scarcely believe we were halfway through 2022.
