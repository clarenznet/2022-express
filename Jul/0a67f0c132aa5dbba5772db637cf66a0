Five fire crews are currently working to bring the blaze at the offices of Nottinghamshire County Council under control. Smoke can be seen coming from a first-floor window. A spokeswoman for Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said: "The time of the call was at 11.45am. "We have 12 pumps either in attendance or on their way." Fire engines from the London Road, West Bridgford, Stockhill, Edwinstowe, Mansfield, Carlton, Stapleford and Bingham stations are among those that were called out. The fire service said it expected to be at the scene for a "considerable length of time" as the first floor of the building was "very smoke logged". It is currently unclear what started the fire. The landmark headquarters are on Loughborough Road on the banks of the River Trent. They were built in the 1930s and opened in 1946, making them the oldest and biggest building the council owns. The site houses the council's chamber for meetings alongside services and support offices. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
