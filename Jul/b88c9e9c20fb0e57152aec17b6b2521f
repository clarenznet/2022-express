In a potentially devastating blow to the cold meat industry, experts are now calling for a crackdown on the use of the additives - and the eating of them. A review by Anses, France's national food safety body, established the link between chemical compounds and cancer risks. Anses said it "recommends reducing consumption by deliberately limiting exposure through food".
