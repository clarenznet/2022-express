Illegal levels of toxic air pollution have been recorded in outer London ahead of plans to expand the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ). Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, has asked Transport for London (TfL) to consult on proposals to push the current boundary further afield. If approved, it would see the ULEZ cover the entire Greater London area, going as far south as Kingston and Croydon, as far west as Hillingdon, as far north as Enfield, and as far east as Havering. The new air pollution findings could give weight to the eventual decision. Mr Khan and TfL are currently holding a public consultation to gauge opinion and appetite for it. If approved, it could come into effect as early as August 2023. The zone has only recently been expanded, pushed out to cover areas up to but not including the north and south circular roads last October. Estimates suggest that the move has taken an estimated 50,000 older polluting vehicles off the road every day. Those who wish to continue to use the roads with such cars must pay a daily charge of £12.50 to enter the zone — an incentive to either get people to use public transport or save money and switch to emission-friendly cars. JUST IN: Drivers to be charged £4,500 every year under Sadiq Khan's new plans While environmentalists hail the plans, others say they are discriminatory against those who may not be able to afford newer eco-friendly vehicles. Regardless, clean air activists say the ULEZ "must be expanded without delay” after illegal levels of Nitrogen Dioxide were found in parts of outer London, according to the Evening Standard.
