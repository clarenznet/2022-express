Raheem Sterling would have accepted a return to Liverpool this summer if Jurgen Klopp's side came calling, reports suggest. Sterling is set to join Chelsea for a fee in the region of £48million. Sterling caused uproar when he quit Anfield for City in 2015, becoming public enemy number one on Merseyside. However, he was reportedly ready to bury the hatchet and return to Liverpool this summer. The England international is believed to have decided earlier in the year that he would depart City this summer if a top offer came his way. And when he made that decision, he apparently had in mind that he would only leave for a top European club. According to The Athletic, that decision meant he would have turned down both Arsenal and Tottenham - but would have accepted a return to Liverpool. The Reds were expected to sign a new forward this summer due to uncertainty surrounding Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane - who signed a new contract and departed for Bayern Munich respectively. In the end, they opted to bring in Darwin Nunez, and were even claimed to have explored making a bid for Sterling. Instead, however, the England winger will join Chelsea after putting pen to paper on a five-year contract. Sterling confirmed early on Wednesday that he would be departing the Etihad, penning an emotional message to the club's fans. It's believed Sterling flew to America on Wednesday to join up with his new team-mates on their tour in Los Angeles. Sterling saw his chances in the City starting line-up limited last season, and the arrivals of Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez have pushed him further down the pecking order. Barcelona were said to be interested last summer, and Sterling was eager to move to the Nou Camp. However, they instead shifted focus to his younger team-mate Ferran Torres, who arrived for £50m and became Xavi's signature signing in January.
