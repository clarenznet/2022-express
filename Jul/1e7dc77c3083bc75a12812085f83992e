The unsuspecting victim, in his 70s, was targeted by two men who pretended to help him but instead reached inside his bag and took cash. Police in Smethwick, West Midlands, have now released images of two people they want to speak to in connection with the incident. The theft happened in the French Walls area of the town on June 7 at around 2.30pm. Sandwell Police, part of the West Midlands Constabulary, tweeted: "We want to speak to these two men after cash was stolen from a pensioner on Beech Way, Smethwick. The man in his 70s was approached by two men who offered to carry his bags, but one of the men reached inside and stole cash from him. "It happened at 2.30pm on June 7. Think you can help? Please get in touch with us via Live Chat on our website quoting crime number 20/483275/22." No further details have been disclosed by police at this stage, Birmingham Live reports.  Express.co.uk recently reported a rise in theft in person and online. One elderly victim, Sue Flood, told how she never thought she would fall victim to a scam but ended up losing nearly £250,000 in a sophisticated pension con. She wants to warn others so they don’t fall for the same tricks. She was approached online by a con artist. She said: "He recommended that we take our pensions as a tax free lump sum and invest the rest in an eight percent return investment. "We duly took the offer and did that." The couple took out £125,000 in cash and invested the other half - it was only when the paperwork didn't arrive that they became suspicious. "I had a breakdown," Sue added. "I felt like the whole thing had slipped away."
