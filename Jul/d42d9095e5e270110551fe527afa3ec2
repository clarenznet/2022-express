Keanu Reeves, 57, unveiled his ageless appearance as he stepped out in a grey monochrome outfit as he waved to fans outside his hotel on Saturday. The Hollywood actor teamed his suit with a pair of brown lace-up boots as he headed toward a black SUV. The Matrix star's girlfriend, Alexandra Grant, 49, also sported a casual look in a pair of jeans, white top and pale pink trainers. Alexandra led the way with the John Wick star trailing closely behind her.
