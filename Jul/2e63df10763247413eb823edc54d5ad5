Liz sparked a frenzy among her 2.4 million followers as she posed up a storm in the swimwear. Alongside the sultry snap, the model wrote: "Chez moi this afternoon #blissfullsummer," alongside two red hearts. In the pic, Liz donned a tiny white bikini as she stood in her luscious looking garden. Liz displayed her pert behind in the string bikini as well as her enviably toned legs and just a hint of side-boob. The mother-of-one looked happily over her shoulder with her brown tresses tumbling down her back as she smiled at the camera.
