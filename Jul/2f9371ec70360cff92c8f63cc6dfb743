It comes after a woman and two other men were bailed by detectives over the disappearance of Somaiya Begum, 20. The Leeds Beckett University undergraduate was last seen at her grandmother's house where she lived, along with an uncle, at 2pm on Saturday. Neighbours said she moved into the house in Bradford, West Yorks, after a row with her parents over an arranged marriage to a man from Pakistan. Forensic teams and sniffer dogs searched the grandmother's house and a home nearby in the city's Undercliffe area, where Somaiya's parents are said to live. A middle-aged couple at the house refused to speak yesterday. Officers were also searching shipping containers believed to belong to a relative on an industrial park nearby. West Yorkshire Police, appealed for information, including dashcam and CCTV footage. He said: "We are extremely concerned for Somaiya's welfare. Her disappearance is completely out of character." Slimly built Somaiya was last seen wearing black jeans, a black top and black headscarf.
