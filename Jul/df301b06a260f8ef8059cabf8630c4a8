  Following the tragic death of her son Jamal Edwards MBE earlier this year, Brenda Edwards was forced to clear up some rumours surrounding her son’s mural on social media today. The Loose Women presenter set the record straight, explaining that “no one set Jamal’s mural alight”.      Brenda, 53, took to Instagram this afternoon to share new information with her 113,000 followers. “Why must people speak on what they know NOTHING about?” she wrote. “Contrary to misinformed and unfactual social media posts, we would like to clarify that the simple explanation is… “No one set Jamal’s mural alight.”     She continued: “Some candles got out of hand and the black smoke reached the bottom of the mural. “It was cleaned the very next morning and is as good as new. “Thank you for the concern,” she concluded with a blue heart emoji. Jama, who was a British music entrepreneur, DJ and founder of online music platform SB.TV, died in February aged 31.    Jamal was also an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, a youth charity which helps young people set up their own businesses. In 2021, he set up Jamal Edwards Delve, a project aimed at refurbishing and reopening youth centres. Widely respected in the music industry, the young entrepreneur helped launch the careers of huge artists like Ed Sheeran, Jessie J, Stormzy and Emeli Sandé. He was awarded an MBE in the New Year's Honours list in 2014 for his services to music.  READ MORE...
