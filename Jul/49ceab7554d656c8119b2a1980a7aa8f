In a plea to the public, the socialite says that while she has “accepted she will never likely see her stolen belongings again”, she is offering a reward of up to 25 percent of the value of anything that is able to be recovered.She begged: “With the total value of the burglary being £26m, that’s a reward of up to £6m for anyone that can help me get back what is rightfully mine.”In November, three Italians - Jugoslav Jovanovic, Alessandro Maltese, and Alessandro Donati - were jailed for 28 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to burgle.A fourth suspect has been identified as Daniel Vukovic who is believed to be on the run in Serbia, according to the BBC.
