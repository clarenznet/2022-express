The Open returns to the home of golf at St Andrews this week for the 150th edition of the oldest major in golf with a host of players gunning to lift the Claret Jug on Sunday. Tiger Woods is back playing major championship golf after skipping the US Open to give his leg a break and being forced to withdraw from the PGA Championship. The 15-time major winner won two of his three Open Championships at St Andrews in 2000 and 2005. Zach Johnson is the last to win The Open at St Andrews back in 2015 but, after a reshuffle on the schedule, the major is back for the 150th edition of the famous event. Collin Morikawa won last year's Open Championship at Royal St George's and will be looking to join elite company in winning the Claret Jug in back-to-back years. Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Scottie Scheffler and Jon Rahm will also be among those hoping to make a deep run in time for Sunday. But Woods is likely to grab the attention of many with the golf icon admitting returning to St Andrews was his main target for 2022.
