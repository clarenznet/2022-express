She has the very narrowest of leads over the Labour leader, with 38 per cent of respondents saying they would prefer her to be PM, and 37 per cent backing Sir Keir. But any indication that under her leadership the Conservatives could pip his party to victory in a general election will fuel Tory hopes that Labour can be kept out of power. The Savanta ComRes polling signals that the Foreign Secretary has won the attention of the nation. In contrast, 40 per cent of people said they would rather have Sir Keir in No 10 than Chancellor Rishi Sunak. A country that is hungry for action to tackle the cost of living crisis may well warm to Ms Truss’s readiness to make radical changes to economic policy. Nearly half of respondents said the most important issue for the next PM should be managing the rising cost of living, and 45 per cent said cutting taxes should be among the top three issues. These are very early days in an election in which only Tory members have a vote but there is mounting evidence that Ms Truss is coming into her own. Sir Keir has been Leader of the Opposition since April 2020 but has not captured the imagination of the public. Ms Truss has the chance to convince the whole country she understands our hopes and fears and can provide the leadership the nation needs.  The start of the summer holidays has been ruined for many families because of France’s failure to put border control staff in place. It is intolerable that botched planning resulted in six hour queues leading up to the Port of Dover. People who have saved up in these tough economic times for a sorely needed break have had a wretched day. France is enriched by British tourism and we have no desire to see a pointless spat. French authorities must face up to their responsibilities, ensure there is no repeat of this fiasco, and maybe then the spirit of Entente Cordiale can be recovered.
