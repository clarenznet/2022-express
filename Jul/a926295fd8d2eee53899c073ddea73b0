High cholesterol contributes to the furring of the arteries, which can lead to several deadly conditions if left unmanaged. Because there are no clear warning signs, however, the condition often goes amiss. Occasionally, high cholesterol can trigger the growth of fatty nodules near the nose and inner eyelids. Because high cholesterol is not clinically linked with any symptoms, a blood test is the best way to detect if you have it. One of the most reliable warning signs of high cholesterol is xanthomas, which are flat yellow growths that develop on the eyelids. The condition can occur in both sexes but females tend to be more frequently affected than males. The most common locations for the fatty growths are one or both upper eyelids, especially near the nose, or one on or both eyelids.
