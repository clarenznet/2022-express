Stephen Fry, 64, smiled for the cameras this afternoon as he headed to his seat to watch the action on day eight of the famous tournament. Actor and comic Stephen had dressed for the occasion, wearing a beige suit with a bright blue shirt beneath it. The former star of double act Fry and Laurie also sported a peacock feather patterned tie to watch Nick Kyrgios and Brandon Nakashima battle it out. It has recently been announced that he will be appearing in Channel 5's new series Dinosaur With Stephen Fry, which will recreate a prehistoric environment. However for now, Stephen has just been soaking up the sunshine and enjoying the tennis.
