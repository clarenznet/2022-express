Rail services have ground to a halt across the UK today as workers fighting for better conditions walk out with support from the RMT union. Union chiefs announced the action last weekend as pay and conditions negotiations with Network Rail failed to bear fruit. The countrywide strikes have had a varying regional impact, in some places completely suspending rail services. Although the RMT is negotiating primarily with Network Rail, today's strikes will impact 15 lines. Some have experienced more disruption than others, and have opted to run on reduced services due to their lack of staff. Both local and national rail services will experience some disruption, with four of five currently cancelled, and Express.co.uk has compiled a status list for would-be travellers. Two planned strikes will hobble Avanti West Coast services, as the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) joined the RMT on the line today. Officials have decided to run one train per hour from Euston to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Preston. They have also ordered a limited service to Glasgow, and each running train will only operate between 8am and "mid-afternoon". C2c has opted to cut services to a third of what they are usually, with trains running on a reduced schedule. Services will only operate in an 11-hour window from 7.30am to 6.30pm at a rate of two trains per hour from most stations aside from those running the Ockendon or Chafford Hundred routes.
