Columnist Daniela Elser claimed the Firm may be starting to "panic" over what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will do next after the pair sparked speculation of a second Oprah Winfrey interview when they were seen visiting the US talk show host recently. Ms Elser highlighted how a senior royal source was quoted as gushing over Prince Charles's recent meeting with Lilibet. Meanwhile, another source praised Harry and Meghan for becoming financially independent in the wake of Megxit during a briefing on Clarence House's annual review. Writing for news.com.au, Ms Elser said: "Still, it’s hard not to wonder if this damage control is too little too late. Feelings would seem to have been hurt badly, Harry has books to sell and the duo has a streaming giant bleeding hundreds of billions to keep sweet. "For now, it’s a watching brief but with all of the opportunities in the near future for the Duke and Duchess to indulge in the penchant for truth-telling and journey-sharing, are a few warm words here and there really going to be enough to prevent them from coming for another prime time pasting?"
