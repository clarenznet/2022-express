The future king, 73, and his wife Camilla, 75, were greeted in Portsmouth by officers aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth yesterday.  The 1982 conflict in the South Atlantic - which lasted 74 days and led to 907 deaths - is being remembered throughout the year. Wearing his military medals, Charles looked in good spirits as he chatted to naval ratings and veterans alike during a reception on the Royal Navy aircraft carrier. Meanwhile, the Charity Commission's probe ended, after it confirmed money was handed to Charles by an ex-Qatari prime minister, in three tranches each of â‚¬1million, from 2011 to 2015 - including cash in a suitcase. Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim gave the donations to Charles for his Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund. The commission said it had got sufficient assurances from charity trustees that they did due diligence on the cash's origin. Noting the Prince would not repeat his actions, a royal source said: "That was then, this is now." The Metropolitan Police are still investigating The Prince's Foundation, another of Charles' charities, over claims his aide offered UK citizenship and an honour to Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, a Saudi donor.
