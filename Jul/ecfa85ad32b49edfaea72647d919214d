Women, dressed to the nines, arrived in towering heels and flamboyant frocks as they watched some of the jockeys ride to victory. The famous racing event in Chichester, West Sussex, attracts guests from up and down the country and is considered one of the more relaxed meetings when it comes to dress code. But that didn’t stop ladies from pulling out all the sartorial stops. One lady certainly stood out from the crowd by wearing an extravagant multi-coloured pom-pom hat, which she paired with a flouncy floral pink dress. She finished the summery look with a forest green clutch bag and matching heels. And keeping on the floral theme, a second stunned in a white mesh dress, embellished with dozens of flowers. Many started their weekend celebrations early Thursday and this group of women were snapped posing in their vibrant dresses and showstopping hats as they enjoyed a girls’ day out. The five-day event is in full swing after a successful couple of days. On Thursday, victory went to Ashleigh Wicheard riding Dark Shot, who won the annual charity race. The mum-of-one blew a kiss to the camera after her winning ride and said: “I love the adrenaline rush you get and almost feeling out of control." “Working with horses is like solving a puzzle, and if you complete it you get the best out of them, so I like the problem-solving part too.” After a year out in 2020 due to the Covid lockdown, the Goodwood Festival returned in 2021 to welcome racegoers back to the circuit. This year, a number of famous faces have been spotted, including football star Harry Redknapp, 75, former Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell, 53, Liz Hurley, 57, Nigel Havers, 70, and politicians Priti Patel, 50, and Ben Wallace, 52. The Qatar Goodwood Festival 2022 runs from July 26 to July 30 at Goodwood Racecourse.
