Rebecca de Mornay, 63, attracted attention all over the world when she took up her breakthrough movie role alongside a young Tom Cruise. The pair had a passionate relationship in the 1983 film Risky Business, when she played a call girl keen to seduce a high school student. Rebecca and Tom's chemistry then spilled over into their real lives, with their subsequent romance lasting two years. The stunning starlet's showbiz career first began behind the scenes, and included writing a theme tune for the 1975 kung fu movie Goodbye Bruce Lee: His Last Game Of Death. These days, Rebecca might look totally different, but she is every bit as glamorous - and very much present on the acting scene. Fans can expect to see her soon in the forthcoming Kevin Spacey thriller Peter Five Eight, which wrapped up production this spring.
