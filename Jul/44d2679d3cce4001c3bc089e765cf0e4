Mikel Arteta has reportedly turned his attentions to Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko as his next transfer target. The Gunners are thought to be in the market for a new left-back this summer, but Zinchenko could prove to be smart acquisition. Arteta's pursuit of Zinchenko would prove to be a smart piece of business for the Gunners. According to the Athletic, Arsenal have begun talks with Man City over a deal for the Ukrainian, who has mostly played second fiddle to Joao Cancelo over the last couple of seasons. Arteta knows Zinchenko well from his time at the Etihad Stadium, and Zinchenko has more than proved his worth over the last six years on the blue side of Manchester. Despite rarely been first choice, the 25-year-old has racked up 128 appearances in all competitions. But it's not just his good attitude and cheeky personality that have made him he is a firm favourite with Pep Guardiola. Zinchenko possesses that much sought after quality - versatility. JUST IN: Arsenal have Zinchenko alternative if Man City deal cannot be struck Yes he's a left-back by trade, but Zinchenko is no stranger to finding himself all over the pitch. Most commonly, he has filled in in central-midfield, and regularly plays in the more advanced role for Ukraine. But he can also play in left-midfield or even on the right in midfield or defence. With Arteta often teetering between a three-back with wing-backs or regular full-backs, Zinchenko should slot right in. Kieran Tierney has ably filled the left-side of a three centre-back system, which would prop up a role for Zinchenko there, with Nuno Tavares and Cedric not really doing the business. But midfield is an area Arteta has also focussed on in the transfer market, and snapping up Zinchenko could save the club millions on signing another player in that position.
