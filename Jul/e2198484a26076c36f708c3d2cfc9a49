England will look to claim their first ever major trophy in football with a win in the women's Euros over the course of July. Coming up against some of the world's toughest teams, including Spain, France and the Netherlands, the Lionesses will have their work cut out over the coming weeks. However, with a home crowd to roar them on and with the knowledge that the final will be held at Wembley should they make it that far, England are billed as one of the favourites to win the competition. With Germany having won all but one of the Euros since 1993 - their only ignominy coming in the 2017 tournament - there is nothing that Sarina Weigman's side will want more than to snatch the trophy on home soil against their bitter rivals. Express Sport takes a look at the whole fixture list, alongside where to watch the matches and match times for the Lionesses.
