England are based in a luxury hotel in west London with a chill-out room, basketball hoop, TV room and tennis courts, while the players have the freedom to walk round nearby Teddington. But there is a competitive edge instilled in the squad to ensure that, even after the 8-0 thrashing of Norway, they were back down to business ahead of tomorrow's final Group A match against Northern Ireland. Lionesses boss Wiegman is likely to make changes for the game with top spot and a quarter-final place already confirmed but there is no letting up with the players. England winger Chloe Kelly, who played in both wins over Austria and Norway, is hoping to start at a sold out St Mary's but knows the competition is making it tough. Kelly said: "We're all fighting for a place, we all have to train well. On the training pitch, the quality is brilliant and the players who haven't had a chance bring quality as well, so we all have to be ready. "It's very competitive, which is bringing out the best in every individual. We'll trust all the players on the pitch, really backing them, and help them beat their best.  "The training is tough in this heat but it is about recovering well, getting our sleep in and being ready when we next have training." Kelly also revealed no one was allowed to get carried away after the Norway game. Wiegman emphasised that message to the squad and she is now determined to make sure that even if she makes changes for Northern Ireland, they will not lose any momentum. They cannot afford to drop levels as they prepare to face either Spain or Denmark in next Wednesday's quarter-final. Wiegman said: "It's about staying grounded and not getting too carried away with an 8-0 win. "There's quality all over the shop in this competition so it doesn't matter who we face, we have to work out how we beat them."
