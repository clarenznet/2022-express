Charles Leclerc managed to chip away at Max Verstappen's advantage in the Drivers' Championship standings by winning the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon. The Ferrari driver was simply too quick than his Dutch rival for the vast majority of the race, with the Italian outfit playing their cards right in terms of strategy to secure a welcome haul of points at the Red Bull Ring. Ferrari could have secured an impressive one-two finish on another day but were ultimately forced to lose Carlos Sainz to an engine failure during the closing stages of the 71-lap contest. The Spaniard's power unit gave up on him as he battled Verstappen for position before his car went up in flames in another cruel stroke of luck for the 27-year-old. Leclerc almost surrendered his lead towards the end of the race due to a problem with his throttle pedal but managed to hang on to claim a hugely impressive victory at the expense of Verstappen, who was ultimately forced to settle for second place. Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, was able to climb up the order from eighth on the grid to secure a stunning podium finish for the second time in as many weeks. ReliveÂ Express Sport's live updates below.
