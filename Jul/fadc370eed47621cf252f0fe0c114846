Ben Affleck has been pictured sobbing while on his honeymoon with new wife Jennifer Lopez. It’s unclear why the actor was feeling so emotional as the couple celebrated their marriage in Paris. Jennifer also recently marked her birthday, turning 53 while on holiday with Ben, 49. The Hollywood couple have been joined by Ben's two children, Violet, 16, and Seraphina, 13, as well as Jennifer's child Emme, 14. The couple got engaged three months ago for the second time, with the actor getting down on one knee for the first time 20 years prior. They finally exchanged vows in a “super small” wedding in Las Vegas, Nevada, earlier this month.
