Manchester United's summer-long pursuit of Frenkie de Jong is still going on, though the club are set to meet the midfielder for talks in a last bid to persuade him to join once Barcelona's US tour is over. The Red Devils are also on the lookout for a striker and a right-back and have been offered someone in the latter department in Benjamin Pavard, who is also being targeted by Chelsea. However, as things stand, United are reportedly not keen on a deal. Newcastle, meanwhile, are in negotiations with Chelsea to sign Timo Werner on loan. His former club RB Leipzig are also keen, but the striker is said to be 'desperate' to prove himself in England, giving the Magpies an advantage. A number of other big Premier League clubs are set to be active over the coming weeks of the transfer market, with Tottenham linked with Nicolo Zaniolo and Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta confirming that he is still working on deals to bring fresh faces to the club. The likes of Liverpool, Everton and West Ham may also be busy while there is expected to be plenty of movement across Europe as we head into the last month of the window.
