London Mayor Sadiq Khan posed for photos with a reveller dressed as the Queen. And ITV This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Alison Hammond joined Olympic gold medallist Dame Kelly Holmes at the event which marked the 50th anniversary of the first march. The streets were awash with rainbow-coloured flags celebrating the LGBT+ community. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying "I was there in 1972".
