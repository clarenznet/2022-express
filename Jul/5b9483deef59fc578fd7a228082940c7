Lines of cars have been spotted outside discount retail park Trago Mills in Newton Abbot in Devon. Unleaded petrol is currently being sold for 164.9p a litre - compared to the national average of 190.65p. While diesel is selling for 179.9p - compared to a national average of 198.42p. The petrol station has the cheapest fuel in the UK, according to the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) fuel watch. It was so busy today that an attendant was put in place to guide the cars in and out.  Their price for unleaded petrol has still seen an increase - having been 153.9 in April 2022 - but is still the cheapest in the UK. The RAC said: "We monitor both wholesale and retail fuel prices daily, including those at the UK's supermarkets and urge retailers to pass on cost savings to motorists when they can be made." Luke Bodset, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said some forecourts have "seized the competitive advantage" of lowering their prices. He said: "Prior to the pandemic, the ‘cost-cutter’ supermarkets would race to announce pump price reductions in line with falls of the wholesale cost. That just doesn’t happen now. "However, there are some independent fuel stations that are charging lower prices that are not only awesome, but where the rest of the fuel trade should be heading." A 5p per litre reduction in fuel duty in March failed to stop pump prices soaring. Rishi Sunak was under growing pressure to implement a further cut before he resigned from his position as Chancellor.  It comes as the owners of a petrol station in Manchester slashed their prices in a bid to become the cheapest petrol station in the UK. Situated on Manchester Road, in Walkden, Greater Manchester, the Limes Service Station significantly dropped its prices for petrol and diesel. Yesterday, the business was selling unleaded at 169.9p, while diesel was available for 185.9p - a drop from the previous 187.9p for unleaded and 194.9p for diesel.
