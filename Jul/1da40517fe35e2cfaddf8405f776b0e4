This country has huge supplies of coal and oil and fracking should be restarted. Are the greens trying to freeze the less well off to death? Angela Merkel gave in to Green pressure in Germany and the country’s politics were in disarray, with a failing economy. She will go down in history as a failed Chancellor and a friend of Vladimir Putin. We have a government so it should govern, do what’s right in the current crisis and ignore green measures. Thomas Sayers, Saltburn, N Yorks ---------------- Suspend overseas aid to help with current crisis The Government sends billions of pounds a year in overseas aid to other countries, including India and China. Why can’t it suspend these payments and help ease the energy crisis in this country? MPs and charities need to focus on the hardships people in this country are going through. David Warner, Derby ---------------- Abolish standing charges to bring down the bills The capped standing charge for electricity is 45p per day and it’s 27p per day for gas. This works out at around £260 a year if you have both and is payable whether you use them or not. They should be abolished during the current situation to further help families to manage better. Anne Jones, Stalybridge, Cheshire ---------------- Sunak and Truss should make a shale gas pledge With the ongoing energy problems, why aren’t Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss promising to give the immediate go-ahead for fracking if they become the next PM?
