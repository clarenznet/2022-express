Kevin Spacey has pleaded not guilty to all five charges of sexual assault after arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court this morning to enter his plea. The Hollywood actor, 62, donned a light blue suit which he paired with a white shirt, polka dot tie and glasses for his court appearance. The House of Cards star is facing charges of four counts of sexual assault against three men, and with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The charges came after a review by the Crown Prosecution Service of the evidence gathered in an investigation by the Met Police. It includes two counts of sexual assault on a man who is now in his 40s in March 2005 in London. A charge of sexual assault on a man who is in his 30s in August 2008 and another count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without concent on the same man. Spacey has also been charged with sexual assault on a man, now in his 30s, in April 2013 in Gloucestershire. Addressing the announcement from the CPS, Spacey said in a statement released to Good Morning America: “While I am disappointed with their decision to move forward, I will voluntarily appear in the UK as soon as can be arranged and defend myself against these charges, which I am confident will prove my innocence.”
