The Syrian leader of the Islamic State, Maher al-Agal was killed in an airstrike. In a statement, U.S Central Command (CENTCOMM) said al-Agal had been killed in the drone strike in northwest Syria. A close associate of his was also seriously injured in the blast. The statement added: "Extensive planning went into this operation to ensure its successful execution. "An initial review indicates there were no civilian casualties." It said al-Agal was responsible for developing ISIS networks outside of Iraq and Syria. He was the leader of the Islamic State in Syria and one of the top five ISIS leaders overall. His death should prove a major blow to the efforts of ISIS to reorganise as a guerrilla force after losing much of their territory.    CENTCOMM spokesperson Col. Joe Buccino said: "This strike reaffirms CENTCOM's steadfast commitment to the region and the enduring defeat of ISIS. "The removal of these ISIS leaders will disrupt the terrorist organization's ability to further plot and carry out global attacks. "ISIS continues to represent a threat to the US and partners in the region. "CENTCOM maintains a sufficient and sustainable presence in the region and will continue to counter threats against regional security." READ MORE:Â Currency of the weak!
