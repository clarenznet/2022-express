The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will strike this week as rail industry workers continue negotiations with Network Rail. Their action on July 27 will impact most overground lines and the London Underground as people modify their commutes. While the union has scheduled only one day of action, it could bleed into the following days this week. Network rail and the 14 other companies impacted by the action will stick to a limited schedule on Wednesday, running fewer services for a shorter time. Most trains will only run between 7.30am and 6.30pm due to a lack of staff, and the overriding advice is that people stay at home if they can. As 40,000 workers plan to join walkouts altogether, the affected companies will need time to adjust for the following day.
