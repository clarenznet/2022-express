Essex Fire Service was at the scene at Botney Hill Road in Billericay. The Service expected to be there for some time and the road is currently closed. The fire was said to be "under control" but three engines remained at the scene.    Botney Hill Road runs through farmland, near a riding school and a golf course. However, the fire was contained to the haystack which could remain burning throughout the evening. Following an unprecedented heatwave, there have been several reports of small fires in recent days in the fields around Billericay. The cause of this fire has not yet been reported. Last Tuesday, July 19, Essex Fire Service reported that its crews were working hard to tackle blazes around the county.

Essex Fire Service was called out to at least 11 field and shrub fires that day. If temperatures soar again this year, the lack of rain coupled with the heat could create the perfect conditions for more fires across the country.
