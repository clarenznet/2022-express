Mr Barclay had been the Prime Minister's fixer in the Cabinet Office and is seen as a trusted pair of hands. The new Health Secretary made his name as his name as Brexit Secretary when he came in late in the Theresa May government to try to rescue the Brexit negotiations with the EU. While he was unable to make a deal he was praised for bringing some toughness to the talks after replacing Dominic Raab who had quit in frustration. A source close to the Government told Express.co.uk: "Barclay is a safe pair of hands. He is exactly the sort of person the Prime Minister needs to stabilise the situation." The appointment is also an indication that Mr Johnson will not quit as Prime Minister but instead plans to fight against rebels.  Earlier, the Prime Minister apologised for appointing Chris Pincher as Deputy Chief Whip who has since been forced to resign over a number of allegations regarding alleged sexual assaults. Loyalist MPs have told Express.co.uk that they have lost confidence in Mr Johnson and appear to be ready to vote for a rebel attempt to oust him.
