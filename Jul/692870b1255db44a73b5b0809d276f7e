The fire started last night (July 4) and crews remain there today (July 5). Surrey Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they have managed to contain the fire with vehicles around the perimeter to protect homes and the roads, reports Surrey Live. The statement said: "The incident is located in Bisley Ranges on MOD land, there are no road closures in place at this time. "Crews are still in attendance with four fire engines and additional specialist vehicles including UniMogs and water carriers. "The fire is contained, with vehicles around the perimeter to protect homes and the roads. "There will still be a large amount of smoke, so it is very important that residents continue to keep doors and windows shut and avoid the area. "At this time the cause of the fire remains unknown." Surrey Fire & Rescue Service (SFRS) received "multiple calls" alerting it to the incident. The exact location of the fire was initially unclear, with some calls to the fire service suggesting it was at Stickleton Ranges, with others suggesting it was around Bisley Ranges. SFRS tweeted at 12.19am: "Firefighters are currently dealing with a large wildfire at Bisley Ranges. "Six fire engines are at the incident and are expected to be there throughout the night. "Please keep windows and doors shut if you are nearby." Residents in both Guildford and Woking reported a smell of smoke in the air when they woke up this morning. This morning, Surrey Wildlife Trust tweeted: "The Trust is liaising with the fire service and MoD in response to a fire on the Range Danger Area of Pirbright Ranges. "Due to restricted access, the fire is being monitored by the fire service and we ask that the public stay away from the area, including nearby Brentmoor Heath."
