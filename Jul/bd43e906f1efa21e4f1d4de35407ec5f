Amanda Holden, 51, showed age is just a number in yet another striking fashion video. The Britain's Got Talent judge posted the video of herself in her silk dressing gown getting ready. Her straight blonde tresses were clipped back, before the star put her hands on her face. Amanda's 1.8 million Instagram followers were left in shock when the video cut to the presenter glammed up in an elegant gown. The off-the-shoulder black gown extenuated Amanda's ample assets. She then applied red lipstick, adding a sultry element to the simple yet elegant gown.
