Graziano Di Prima, 28, and his wife Giada Lini, 32, marked a big milestone surrounded by their Strictly Come Dancing co-stars, family and friends. The professional dancers exchanged vows at his old local church, Basilica della Madonna della Catena, in Sicily. The couple - who fell in love while partnered on a TV show in 2014 - shared their wedding with OK!, with them exclusively opening up about the emotional ceremony to the outlet. But Graziano has since revealed his pal and original best man Johannes Radebe was forced to miss the occasion due to having visa issues. He told the publication: "He called me crying on the day. “In the morning he told me, ‘I know I’m not there but I’ve been crying all night and my heart will be beside you.’ He also said he had dressed up as though he was at the wedding, but he was at his apartment at home."
