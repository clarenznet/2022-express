Frankie Bridge, 33, stunned as she showed up at London's plush Sanderson Hotel in a strapless, black bandage dress which scarcely covered her voluptuous bosom. The Loose Women star had been attending ITV's annual summer party when she almost incurred a wardrobe malfunction. Though the Solace London branded dress skimmed her ankles, it also featured a revealing slit at the back of the skirt section. The backless style showcased her slender waist and shoulders, while the peekaboo feature left little to the imagination around her chest. Frankie shunned jewellery and kept her look simple, pairing the figure-flattering frock with a plain black pair of strappy heels to match.
