Janette Manrara, 38, has revealed she worries about teenage girls and the effect Instagram filters are having on their self-esteem. The Strictly star admitted to Express.co.uk that she is concerned for the younger generation, who feel they have to look a certain way because of what they see on social media. It Takes Two host Janette was speaking at the launch of New Nordic’s new Collagen Shot, exploring the rise of beauty from within and the practice of taking collagen to improve how you look and feel from the inside out. “I've always been an advocate to try and be as natural and as organic as possible with my beauty regime,” she said. “I don't know if you guys have any teenage daughters or friends that have teenage daughters, but when I see what's happening online nowadays when you see girls putting filters on their face, changing the shape of their eyes or changing the shape of their nose. “That really worries me.” She continued: “These simple little things are kind of advocating the importance of just taking Collagen Shots, drinking lots of water, getting good sleep, and eating healthy. “Combining the beauty and the wellness aspect and showcasing that more and more to our generation. So that there's less artificial fixing.” Janette, who is married to fellow Strictly star Aljaž Škorjanec, also opened up on her fears she would burn out while undertaking her gruelling schedule on the BBC dance show. She departed to become the new It Takes Two host in 2021. Discussing how she had heard of people totally burning out and collapsing due to the stress of work, she said: “It wasn't until the pandemic happened and I was forced to kind of slow down, that I realised just how close I could have been to something like that happening to me. “And I think that's the same for a lot of people these days, we all learned and  reflected a lot in lockdown in some shape, or form. “I fell in love with meditation and yoga, and wellbeing has always been a subject that I'm interested in because it encompasses all of those things in one.” She continued: “So I took a course online and then another course online and I'm not an expert, but I would say I am a fan, I am a wellness warrior.

"I really think it's important to be authentic and work with brands that you genuinely, use, genuinely like and really support. “So I don't work with many brands, I only have a select few and New Nordic is by far, when it comes to looking after my beauty, one of my favourites. "So I'm really excited to be here and champion them and champion the product.”
