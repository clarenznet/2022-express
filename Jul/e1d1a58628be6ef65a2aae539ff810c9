Romeo Beckham's girlfriend Mia Regan, 19, brought a flash of high fashion to Wimbledon in her white skirt and black crop top, both by pricey designer Miu Miu. She paired the two-piece outfit with a baby blue cropped cardigan and let her blonde tresses loose, as she posed for photos in the VIP Suite for sponsor Evian. However, rather than just wearing the colour, she seemed to be feeling blue without her boyfriend in tow. On occasion she looked a little bored in the audience while watching the centre court action take place. Romeo, the son of fashion designer Victoria Beckham and ex-footballer David, has been in a relationship with the beautiful model for three years, but he was not present at the tournament today.
