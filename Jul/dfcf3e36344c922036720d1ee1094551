Sebastian Stan, 39, looked unrecognisable as he got into character on the set of his upcoming movie, A Different Man. The Hollywood star looked completely different after undergoing a transformation for his latest role, a man who suffers from neurofibromatosis. Sebastian could be seen walking around New York City during filming, wearing a green jacket and khaki trousers - paired with matching black trainers and a crossbody bag.
