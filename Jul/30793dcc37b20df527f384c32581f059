Ukrainian Security Service reported the Russians had bombed a battalion of their proxies from the Donetsk Oblast who had been fighting on their side in the region. The troops had been attempting to retreat from the front line. The Security Service found out about the embarrassing mistake after intercepting Russian phone calls. Meanwhile, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said more than 20 people could be trapped in the rubble of the five-storey building in the town of Chasiv Yar after Russian forces shelled it. At least 19 people have been killed in the strike. The Ukrainian Government has urged people in Russian-occupied areas of the country to evacuate “by all possible means” ahead of a Ukrainian military offensive as Moscow’s forces were described as creating a “true hell” in the eastern industrial heartland.
