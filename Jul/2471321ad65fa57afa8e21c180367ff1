David Beckham, 47, and ex-Spice Girl wife Victoria, 48, are renowned for their mischievous videos detailing life as one of the UK's most famous couples. However this time David posted a close-up of his wife's toes, making a comparison to percebes, or goose barnacles as they are known in Britain. Percebes might have a reputation as the most expensive seafood in the world, but it's not known for its beauty, as David's Instagram photo demonstrates. The fashion entrepreneur has admitted in the past to having trouble with her feet due to years of squeezing them into uncompromisingly high six-inch stilettos. Victoria may not have appreciated the reference, delivered to David's 74.7 million followers, but she has form for embarrassing the family on social media too. Hours earlier, she had posted video footage of her husband doing the "worm" in his pyjamas outside, prompting their teenage son Romeo to groan and demand that she changed her caption.
