Gaming fans are counting down to the start of the 2022 NACON Connect event. The upcoming live stream takes place at 6pm BST UK time on July 7. As part of the event, the French gaming company has promised to showcase 17 titles, not to mention a whole host of video game-related accessories, including the Daija arcade stick. The live event - which you can watch below - will be followed by a deep-dive into some of the games on show. "In total, 17 games will be shown, including the highly anticipated Steelrising, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, not to mention new products from the gaming accessories range," NACON explains. "Our hosts will return after the show to discuss the news just shared with the community." Confirmed games include Lord of the Rings Gollum, Robocop Rogue City, SteelRising, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, Blood Bowl 3, WRC Generations and Ad Infinitum. That's on top of Clash Artifacts of Chaos, Hell is Us, War Hospital, Chef Life and Session Skate Sim. According to NACON, an additional five video games will be exclusively revealed during the course of the event. The Lord of the Rings Gollum is undoubtedly one of the most hotly anticipated games at the event. The upcoming adventure game was one of the first titles to be officially announced for the PS5. It's also coming to Xbox Series X, as well as PS4 and Xbox One. "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure," reads the official description. "Take on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to him. Gollum is skilful and cunning, but also torn by his split personality. One mind, two egos – you decide!" Judging by previous gameplay footage, Gollum will spend most of the game running and sneaking around, avoiding enemies and running away from monsters.
