Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer welcomed Channel 4 viewers to their weekly staple, Sunday Brunch. One of the many guests on the show were the filmmakers of the thrilling BBC series, Prehistoric Planet, narrated by David Attenborough. However, rather than being left mesmerised by the computerised footage of what scientists believe to be an accurate insight into the early creatures, many viewers slammed the show for the interview, arguing dinosaur information is "guesswork". Tim and Simon spoke animatedly to the producers of the documentary. Explaining the science behind the series, filmmaker Tim Walker stated: "We do an amazing thing, this is a science bit for you, we do phylogenetic bracketing where we look at dinosaurs on the evolutionary tree. "And look at the living animals that sit by the side of them on that evolutionary tree "So if you take something like the T-Rex, we know that next to it on the evolutionary tree are birds and crocodilians.

So, using phylogenetic bracketing you can look at the behaviours of those living animals and infer that the extinct animals would have done very similar stuff." He did acknowledge how scientists can't be certain about their theories about the dinosaurs though. He continued: "You know, a lot of scientific research goes into it. "But we'll never know... we'll never know 100 per cent for certain what the dinosaurs and the other prehistoric animals did, because they're fossils, we can't go back in time." "But the T-rex is a really good example," Simon pointed out. "Because the T-rex was my favourite dinosaur as a child because it's like the big, angry one that kills things. "And you've got it swimming! And it's just ruined the T-Rex's rep as being big and tough, because you've got this beast swimming and it suddenly seems quite gentle and calm." Taking to social media, some viewers questioned the documentary. DON'T MISS...

That's better I got that off my chest #sundaybrunch." Others complained about the Sunday Brunch and its reference to the dinosaur programme. @norfldn2 posted: "This f***ing show is proper amateurish #SundayBrunch." @MadKDog shared: "The show has matured to an obvious point in human nature, where boring people become annoying.  #sundaybrunch." "F*** me ....no wonder dinosaurs became extinct #SundayBrunch," @Laurie_Lingo quipped. However, the series has received plenty of praise from fans of Attenborough's previous work. The latest episode of Sunday Brunch also received backlash for its choice of line-up, with fans claiming they did not know any of the guests. The hosts spoke to Adrian Lester, Hugo Chegwin, Gareth Malone, Nina Toussaint-White and Mabel. Sunday Brunch airs weekly from 9.30am on Channel 4.
