Minnie Driver, 52, kept it casual as the actress sported a light blue button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up during an outing on Tuesday. The British-American actress teamed the top with a pair of navy blue and white striped trousers and topped the look with glamorous sunglasses. The Good Will Hunting star accompanied her attire with a pair of flat slip-on shoes with a western-influenced design. The actress previously opened up about her Hollywood lifestyle and admitted she is glad she didn't succumb to "tons of plastic surgery". The on-screen star said: “So, it is weird, like, I definitely left myself behind on a lot of levels, and I paid for that. I definitely paid for that.” “That was a bar tab I ran that would eventually have gotten paid, and I was lucky to, I think, come out the other side of it - not addicted to drugs or having five husbands, or tons of plastic surgery. “Like, I actually feel like I survived giving up myself, being terrible, remembering it and coming out the other end of the tunnel.”
