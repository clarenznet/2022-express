Eva Longoria, 47, looked fabulous yesterday as she soaked up the sun in Marbella during a family holiday. The actress commanded attention in a white swimsuit that flashed her side-boob, while rocking a matching hat. Eva accessorised the chic look with dainty gold jewellery and dark sunglasses. The Desperate Housewives star could be seen strolling on the beach and splashing in the sea as she enjoyed her day out with her son Santiago, four, who she shares with her husband, José Bastón.
