Amanda Holden stunned in a skimpy, green bikini as she kicked back and relaxed in Sicily, Italy. The star, 51, is in the Mediterranean country to film upcoming BBC show The Italian Job with funnyman Alan Carr. But it seems Amanda has found a way to top up her already perfect tan in between takes. Lying back on a boat, the star soaked up the sun in the luminous swimwear, while just placing the triangle shapes over her breasts to prevent tan lines. The Heart FM host donned a stylish pair of sunglasses and a headscarf to keep her blonde tresses out of her face. She captioned the snap: "Veni vidi amavi," alongside a green heart.
