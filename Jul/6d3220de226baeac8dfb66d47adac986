David de Gea made a dig about three of his Manchester United team-mates over their Wimbledon predictions ahead of Sunday's final between Nick Kyrgios and Novak Djokovic - with the Spaniard claiming that those who gave their answers had 'never seen a tennis match in their lives'. Tom Heaton, Victor Lindelof and James Garner all lined up on United's Twitter page to give their thoughts and punditry on the final at SW19. With Djokovic the heavy favourite, many have backed the Serbian to win, although Kyrgios is bound to pack a surprise in what is one of the most hotly-contested finals in a long time. Fans across the world are gearing up to watch the final on Centre Court, sparking interest between sportsmen and fans alike. But De Gea has argued that the trio don't know anything about tennis in a hilarious tweet. "They’ve never seen a tennis match in their life," De Gea said, followed by two joking emojis. Fellow shot-stopper Heaton gave his verdict on how the well-awaited final would pan out. "Kyrgios has been brilliant, he's brought a bit of entertainment! But for me, It'll be Djokovic," Heaton said. "He's been outstanding for a number of years, I feel like it's his time again." Meanwhile, Swedish star Lindelof backed the English goalkeeper's verdict. "I think it's going to be a good final, but in the end I think that Djokovic is going to win," the former Benfica star claimed. However, recently returned Garner, who enjoyed a superb spell at Nottingham Forest last season, backed the Aussie to weave his magic. He added: "I think it will be a good game, I think Kyrgios will win! I think his serve is too good." Lindelof chimed in with a "no way" remark, though Garner had already made his mind up. Kyrgios has earned attention for some of the right and some of the wrong reasons as a result of his controversies on the court throughout his career. The Australian estimated that he has earned around £400,000 in fines throughout his professional career.
