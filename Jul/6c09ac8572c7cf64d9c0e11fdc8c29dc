Manchester United's deal to sign Tyrell Malacia has hit a potential snag surrounding his representation for the imminent transfer, according to reports. The Red Devils have already struck an agreement worth £12million to sign the Dutchman from Feyenoord but there is still work for United to do in order to get the signing over the line.  Dynamic defender Malacia initially seemed set to join French side Lyon, who agreed a £12m package with the Eredivisie club before United swooped in to hijack the agreement. But according to The Athletic, Erik ten Hag's side are now encountering complications in their move to sign the full-back as their exhausting quest for summer recruits threatens to rumble on. That's because there is seemingly an issue with Malacia's representation and the intermediary used to broker the transfer. It's claimed the individual has not been authorised to conduct the move, meaning Malacia will have to resolve the issue by changing reps in order to push the transfer through.

The decision is unlikely to affect United's pursuit of De Jong which is now close to nearing a positive conclusion. An agreement is believed to be in place with Barcelona over a fee, although there is still some elements of the transfer to resolve before he is a United player. Lyon are now resigned to losing Malacia to Ten Hag's side and have already begun exploring replacements. Watford's Hassane Kamara is one of the names on their radar, though they are yet to move for the Ivorian.
