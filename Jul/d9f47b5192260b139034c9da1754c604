Owner Chloe Brown, 24, said: "I got Motley when he was 21 weeks old and started training him to free fly." "We started off with a harness and an elastic line which got longer each time." "We progressed to free flying so now when I take him out he explores the skies but he always comes back to me." Chloe, a zoo biology student, says Motley and his chums Echo and Rosie, particularly enjoy flying in the Peak District which is only a 45-minute drive from her home in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Notts. She said: "His absolute favourite place is Curbar Edge. The thermals come straight up the cliff." Chloe has posted pictures and videos of Motley's escapades on social media. She said: "The response has been amazing. He's got 4,000 or so followers on TikTok and a few thousand on Instagram and Facebook." She is using Motley's profile to campaign against clipping birds' wings or keeping them in cages. He will feature on an episode of The Antiques Roadshow later this year.
