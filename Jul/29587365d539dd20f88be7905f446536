In a statement made on Saturday, the White House physician, Dr Kevin O'Connor, said that Mr Biden has experienced "no reemergence of symptoms, and continues to feel quite well" and will, as a result, not resume treatment, the White House said. Mr O'Connor said the President tested negative on Tuesday evening, Wednesday morning, Thursday morning and Friday morning before testing positive on Saturday morning. Mr O'Connor added: "However, given his positive antigen test, he will reinitiate strict isolation procedures." The White House physician added: "However, given his positive antigen test, he will reinitiate strict isolation procedures." CNN journalist DJ Judd tweeted: "President Joe Biden has tested positive again for Covid-19, per a letter from Dr. Kevin O'Connor, in what the doctor says is likely a "rebound" Covid positivity 'observed in a small percentage of patients treated with Paxlovid'".  Mr Biden's positive test is believed to be a "rebound" positivity experienced by some coronavirus patients who take the anti-viral drug Paxlovid. Paxlovid is an antiviral medication produced by Pfizer. The drug is used to treat high-risk patients, such as older patients. A small but significant percentage of people who take Paxlovid will suffer a rebound.
