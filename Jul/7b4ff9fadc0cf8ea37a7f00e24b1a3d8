We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised." Then they called it off altogether and Jennifer had twins with pal Marc Anthony, although she later described their relationship as "a Band Aid on the cut".Meanwhile Ben married Jennifer Garner in 2005, going on to have three children with her.However Jennifer was in high spirits in her newsletter as it all came full circle and the bride with the ageless complexion finally found herself back in Ben's arms."We read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we'll wear for the rest of our lives," she explained."In the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined."
