A convoy of police vehicles have descended upon Lodmoor Country Park in Weymouth to deal with the incident. They have lined up in a nearby car park. There are also officers patrolling the area and liaising with those at the encampment. It is not yet known how many caravans are at the park, however pictures suggest there are at least two large living units at the site. Police are currently at the scene to monitor the site and prepare to carry out any relevant risk assessments to determine if any support is needed for the group,Â reports Dorset Live. There have been a spate of traveller encampments, also involving large numbers of caravans, at various sites across the south of the country recently.  The latest incident comes as a children's paddling pool was forced to close following a contamination incident after an unauthorised encampment near the site. The pool at Fleming Park in Eastleigh, Hampshire, closed on July 12, as it was "contaminated with human waste", claimed councillor Alex Bourne. The incident took place after police were made aware of an unauthorised encampment at nearby Places Leisure on Passfield Avenue at around 7pm on Monday, July 11. Roughly 35 caravans and 40 vehicles arrived on the field behind the car park at the leisure centre. Meanwhile, a school in Buckinghamshire was forced to close its doors last week after a group of travellers arrived on the premises. Students at Oakgrove School in Milton Keynes had to study remotely as a result of the travellers being on the school's land. In addition to this, travellers also forced the closure of a cafe and play area in Cornwall. After being made to leave the area, the travellers then angered residents by moving just a few miles away in the same town.
