Madonna, 63, looked fabulous last night as she slipped into a low-cut lace corset in a series of new pictures. The Material Girl singer posed up a storm as she penned a cryptic message to fans on her Instagram. The snaps saw Madonna seduce the camera while striking a series of poses and drinking from her Versace cup. Along with each picture, she wrote a word, eventually spelling out: “Remove separation between soul and body.”
