The 150th Open Championships are now underway at St Andrews with Tiger Woods back at the home of golf and the scene of his two victories back in 2000 and 2005. The 15-time major winner had made St Andrews his main personal goal for this year making his comeback after the near-fatal car crash in February 2021. He shocked many by lining up for both The Masters and the PGA Championship - both of which were difficult walks for Woods and his damaged leg. St Andrews won't offer the same difficulties as the links course isn't as hilly as the other majors. And Woods certainly knows his way around St Andrews having won twice at the Old Course. The likes of Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm Xander Schauffele will all be hoping to stop Woods from winning a 16th major. Schauffele arguably comes into The Open in the best form having won at both the Travelers Championship and Scottish Open. There will also be plenty of attention on the likes of Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau, all of whom who have defected to LIV Golf in recent months. Express Sport provides live updates throughout the weekend as Sunday approaches and a new 'Champion Golfer of the Year' will be crowned.
