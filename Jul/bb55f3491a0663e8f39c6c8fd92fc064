Rob Stirk had just started his shift as a home shopping driver for Asda's Skelmersdale store in Lancashire when he noticed the women at the side of the road. However, the 59-year-old was shocked to find them in the same spot two hours later, despite it being one of the hottest days of the year. Stopping his van, Rob approached the group with bottles of cold water, reports The Liverpool Echo. The women explained how they were returning from a hen party in Liverpool when their coach got a puncture. One of the passengers, named Helen, tweeted to thank Rob for his help She posted: "Wanted to thank this Asda delivery driver for stopping on the side of the road and giving us cold water for free, absolutely outstanding service! "This guy saved us from dehydration, been out in Liverpool for a hen and the coach tyre has blown and we've been stranded for two hours with hangovers. So thank you for his kindness and many other people too." Rob said: "I drove past them earlier on my shift and two hours later they were still there, sprawled on the grass verge. It was one of the hottest days of the year so I got some ice-cold bottles of water out of the van and handed them out. They were so grateful. "I just thought it was the right thing to do. It was just so hot." Lisa Dean, the store's home shopping manager, said: "It was such a kind thing for Rob to do. He obviously saw that they were in trouble in this heat and went to help. He's a very helpful driver."
