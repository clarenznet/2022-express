In his 1960 book The Desert Generals he lambasted Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and his 1942 battle at El Alamein in Egypt, which many saw as a decisive rout of Rommel's forces. Barnett argued the battle could have been avoided and said Montgomery was a poor strategist and was as lost as a "dray horse on a polo field". Instead he heaped praise on General Claude Auchinleck who had won the first battle of Alamein. Veterans of the Eighth Army were furious with Barnett's interpretations, but many historians sided with him after examining his carefully thoughtout arguments. As well as scrutinising how Britain fared in wars, he explored the country's role in the world and how opportunities were missed. Post-war governments habitually failed to invest properly in industry and training, which meant the country moved forward more slowly than it should have done. Margaret Thatcher was a keen admirer of many of his views, but he never showed any affiliation to any political party. Born in Croydon, Barnett excelled at school, and studied modern history at Oxford.  As a consultant for the BBC's 1960s series The Great War, he won the Screenwriters Guild award. He worked closely with the BBC on other projects, including the 1970s series The Commanders. He published many more books, was appointed fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, and went on to work as keeper of the Churchill Archives Centre. Appointed CBE in 1997, he is survived by two daughters from his marriage to the late Ruth Murby. Correlli Barnett, born June 28, 1927â€“ died July 10, 2022, aged 95
