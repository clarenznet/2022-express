Kevin and Nicola Gomersall live in Whinmoor, West Yorkshire with their five kids aged three, 10, 13, 15 and 17. They were spotted by Leeds Live selling their possessions at Wetherby Car Boot Sale. The father, 40, who is a construction worker, spoke out about the difficulties he and his wife are facing in order to get by. He told Leeds Live: “It’s a bit of a nightmare. We don’t even get to go out anymore. We basically have to sit in because we have no more money to pay. "When you’re living underneath each other, it causes a lot of arguments. We get angry. We need our space.” Energy bills for the couple, who have to provide computers and access to the internet for their kids, have risen by £75, which the mum says is a “big jump”. The 39-year-old Nicola, who works as a cleaner, said that the family is being forced to make impossible decisions regarding their everyday life.

The Government don’t give a damn. “Our kids don’t eat as healthy anymore because it costs too much for food. We’re giving them ready meals, something quick and simple.” The pair say the real kicker is the rise in fuel costs, it costs £50 a week just to take their 15-year-old son to school. Nicola said: "I’m having to go there and back every day – it costs me about £50 a week now to get my kid to school.” DON'T MISS: Simon Calder warns holidaymakers flying THIS weekend 'Good luck!'Sturgeon skewered over Queen meeting as she refuses to curtsyMet Police officers 'who called Meghan a golliwog' sacked
