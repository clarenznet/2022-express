Families being suffocated by the mounting cost-of-living crisis are plotting non-violent strikes to bring suppliers to their knees. Gas and electricity bills are set to surge to £3,420 in October before jumping to £3,850 in January - enormous sums for many during the coldest months. Finance guru Martin Lewis said: "The price cap is due to rise 77 per cent whatever your bills. The situation is hysterical. There are huge mental and physical health risks to millions from unaffordable energy and food price rises."  Suppliers are raking in vast sums as households suffer, with British Gas owner Centrica's operating profits increasing five-fold to £1.34billion. Now, much like the PollTax outcry of the 1990s, a movement is growing which is pushing for people to submit meter readings but cancel their direct debits. Households are told to "let energy firms fail and demand the Government provides cheap, subsidised energy". Mr Lewis added that "a strike on energy bills and getting rid of the legitimacy of paying [them] could soon make not paying bills "socially acceptable". Under huge pressure, the Government last night promised households would receive non-repayable £400 discounts on winter bills. They will be given by suppliers and paid over six months, with payments starting from October. Households will be able to get a £66 discount in October and November, rising to £67 each month from December through to March next year.
