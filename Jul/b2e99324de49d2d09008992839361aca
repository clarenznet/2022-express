Why is it called the Super Buck Moon? Full Moons are given names from a Native American calendar system that uses different Full Moons as a calendar to keep track of the seasons. Each Full Moon is named after an event or occurrence that happens during that time of year. This supermoon in July will be named the Super Buck Moon, as male deer shed and grow their antlers around this time of year. Last month in June, the supermoon was called the Super Strawberry Moon as wild strawberries begin to ripen in the early summer.    Unfortunately, the Super Buck Moon on July 13 will be the last supermoon of 2022. Supermoons only occur two or three times a year and last month we had the Super Strawberry Moon on June 14. The next supermoon will take place next year in 2023 and will both be in August: one on August 1, 2023 and the next on Thursday, August 31.
