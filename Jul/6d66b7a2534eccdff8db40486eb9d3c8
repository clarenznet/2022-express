Dr Claire Shortt, a scientist at Food Marble, explained which foods would work best to help long Covid sufferers. She told Express.co.uk: “The food we eat is very important. It’s best to avoid processed foods and focus on eating as many whole foods as possible. “There is some research supporting the use of the Mediterranean diet, which eliminates processed food from the diet. “Eating can be challenging when you aren’t feeling the best or tired. “However, your body and gut need a balanced and wide variety of foods with a mix of macro and micro-nutrients. “Anything you can do to boost your immune system and help mitigate fatigue is important.”  READ MORE: 'Get the vaccine!'

Think of it as eating the rainbow, lots of different coloured plant foods.” These include fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, beans and pulses and foods made using wholegrains. “A trick is to eat mixed nuts, seeds and pulses,” she said. “These often come in a mixed variety and can quite quickly boost the diversity of your diet.” Certain micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) can also help boost our immune response.   She commented: “Taking a multivitamin is convenient but if you can obtain these through diet, it is much more beneficial.” Dr Shortt recommended: Red meat and poultry - for zinc, iron, selenium and B vitamins. Seafood - for selenium, iron, zinc and calcium.
