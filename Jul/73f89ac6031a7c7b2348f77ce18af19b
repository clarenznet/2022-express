Former Strictly Come Dancing star Ola Jordan, 39, expressed her frustrations saying the couple's bodies have changed shape since quitting the BBC series. Much to her dismay, the professional dancer was shocked to see she and her other half had "mum and dad bods". Her admission comes after she shared a photo of herself poolside wearing a pink bikini as she put her physique on full display. James, 44, was also in the photo as the happy couple beamed at the camera for the candid. Ola captioned the post: "Hi guys. I wasn’t going to post this picture but I’ve decided to because I’m horrified and so disappointed with myself and by posting it I’m hoping it will help motivate me to do something about it. "Our friend took this snap of us yesterday trying to stay cool by the pool but OMG... it was a total shock to say the least! When did we get ‘mum and dad bods’ ????" "We know we’re not in our best Strictly shape but hey that’s what happens when you stop dancing for hours every day and have a baby (I just want to know James’ excuse). Stay cool everyone. I think I need to avoid the ice cream for a while!!!" She finished: "Couples That Eat Together Stay Together. @jamesjordan1978." James cheekily replied: "Saw this ages ago but my message didn’t go up - have you been drinking? "We just look different babe - but OMG I look old."
