But is there a way to increase one’s chance of winning a top prize? More than 400 Britons have become millionaires since NS&I launched Premium Bonds in 1957. In June 2022, the savings provider celebrated it's 65th anniversary - with 4,823,067 prizes paid out to date.

Another 39 people were celebrating after winning £25,000, while 99 people won £10,000 and 196 were £5,000 richer.
