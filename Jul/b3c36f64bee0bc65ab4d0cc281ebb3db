The offenders removed from the UK on Wednesday had received combined prison sentences of more than 188 years and were convicted of crimes including rape, sexual assault and kidnap. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “These criminals are responsible for appalling offences including rape, sexual assault and kidnap, which destroy lives, families and communities.   “They have violated our laws and our values, leaving their victims living with the scars of their crimes. “The British public should be in no doubt of my determination to remove them by all available means to make our streets safer. “Our new Nationality and Borders Act will help end the cycle of last-minute claims and appeals that can delay removals. “We are continuing to remove foreign criminals and those with no right to be here, as the public rightly expects.”  The removal flight was conducted in cooperation with the Romanian government and formed part of a regular schedule of returns to several countries to remove offenders with no right to remain in the UK. In June 2022, 240 foreign national offenders were removed from the UK on both charter and scheduled flights. Since January 2019 the UK has removed 10,741 foreign national offenders.
