He may not be perfect (who is?) but he has worked hard for us. Idiots got rid of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher and modern-day idiots have now done the same.  The Conservative Party will now lose the next election. Can they quickly back-track and get Boris back in time to save the day? It would be a first but I would not be surprised. Some people think Liz Truss now has it in the bag, as Rishi Sunak is being blamed for the demise of Boris rather than Boris being blamed for the demise of Boris, says Diane Silva from Bournemouth, Dorset. But she is totally not what the people voted for in 2019, a Remainer who in no way would have led the Tories to such an emphatic victory. No wonder some disgruntled Tories even want Boris back. In his closing speech he did say: "Hasta la vista." I wonder if behind closed doors he is also be saying: "I'll be back." I still want Boris but cannot have him. Since the leadership contest began Liz Truss has been my choice because of her admirable Brexit deal-making as International Trade Secretary, says Steve Hancock from Northampton. She has also shone as Foreign Secretary. So come on Liz, consign your opponent to the bin.

Well, I coined the phrase "Vote Rishi, Get Starmer" while there were five candidates in the race. I see no reason to change that sentiment, now there are just two. Fergus Kelly points out that the BBC is using its coverage of women's football to say that there is a lack of diversity in the game, as there are no black players in the England team, says Alex Owen from Coventry. But if there is a problem, then how come EE is using an advert based on the same team to accuse men of being sexist?
