ULEZ adjustments over the last few years have seen Sadiq Khan crack down on London's pollution, one of the Labour Mayor's key campaign pledges. The low emission zones have helped reduce health inequalities and improve Londoners' overall health over the last few years. Mr Khan has resolved to extend them further by 2023, and TFL may soon require cars to pay if they don't meet its standards. The ULEZ currently covers inner-city London, residing inside the North and South Circulars. Approximately one million vehicles travel within this area every day, most of which comply with the zone's standards. Mr Khan has proposed that the zone expand to cover Greater London by August 29, 2023.

Inner London boroughs currently within the ULEZ include: While not a borough, the City of London is also included in the ULEZ. The ULEZ combats pollution by requiring people to ensure their vehicles comply with lower emissions standards. They vary with each vehicle type included within the ULEZ definition, such as cars, motorcycles, lorries and larger vehicles, vans and minibuses. Those that don't meet these standards must pay a daily charge, currently £12.50, or risk a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). The emissions standards for each vehicle type are: Cars, vans and minibuses Petrol: Euro 4 Diesel: Euro 6 Motorbikes Euro 3 NOx standards Lorries, coaches and larger vehicles over 3.5 tonnes or buses, minibuses and coaches over five are exempt from daily ULEZ charges. They will need to pay the LEZ charge if they don't meet those requirements, and people can check those on the TFL website.
