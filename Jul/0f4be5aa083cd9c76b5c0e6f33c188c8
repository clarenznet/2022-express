Manchester United's transfer window has fired into life after Erik ten Hag learned that Cristiano Ronaldo wishes to leave the club this summer. The Portuguese talisman is not satisfied with being out of the Champions League in the twilight of his career, and has asked for all offers to be considered.

Bayern Munich, who currently oversee the rapidly expiring contract of Gnabry, have even been linked for a shock play for Ronaldo himself. Elsewhere in the Premier League Chelsea are still eyeing a statement signing, with talks still progressing for Man City's Raheem Sterling. One whisper which refuses to go away is the linking of Brazil icon Neymar with Stamford Bridge, after the superstar was reportedly told by PSG that he can seek a move away from France this summer.
