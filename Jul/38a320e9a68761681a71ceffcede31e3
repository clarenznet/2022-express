A significant stretch of the A31 remained closed both ways today as police investigate the smash, believed to have happened at around 1.15am near Farnham, Surrey. The 21-year-old driver of one of the cars has died and the 22-year-old passenger of the same vehicle has also lost his life. The driver of the other car, a 32-year-old man, remains in a critical condition in hospital, Surrey Live reports. A spokesperson for Surrey Constabulary said: "We are appealing for witnesses following a two-vehicle collision on the A31 Farnham bypass in the early hours of today (July 6). The collision, involving a Polo and a Mercedes, took place between the Coxbridge roundabout and the Weydon Lane junction at around 1am. "Sadly the driver of one of the vehicles involved, a 21-year-old man, and the passenger a 22-year-old man, were pronounced dead at the scene and their next of kin have been made aware. Their families are currently being supported by specialist officers. The driver of the other car, a 32-year-old man, has been taken to hospital in critical condition." Due to the road closure, motorists expected today a further 40 minutes onto their journey times in both directions.  Drivers were being diverted through Farnham itself, which has caused traffic congestion in the centre of the market town. Some motorists, particularly those heading east towards Guildford, Surrey, used the A325 south and then local roads through the Shortheath and Compton neighbourhoods. It is unclear at this stage what caused the accident. It comes after the M25 through Surrey was congested recently after another horrific car crash, which happened near junction 8 for Reigate. The accident happened anti-clockwise on the big orbital motorway.
