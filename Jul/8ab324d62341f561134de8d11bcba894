Musician, singer, and songwriter John Lennon had a net worth of $200million (£165.7million) dollars at the time of his unfortunate death in 1980, according to Celebrity Net Worth.com. Today, the singer would be worth $620million (£513.7million) after adjusting for inflation. John’s wife Yoko Ono is believed to have a net worth of $700million (£579.9million). John was one of the most-renowned musicians of our time and was celebrated for his incredible lyrics. It’s not surprising then that the talented musician owned a plethora of homes when he was alive.

The stunning home is set on 1.3 acres of land and included 14,000-square-foot Spanish-style main house, a three-car garage, two swimming pools, and a beachfront cabana.
