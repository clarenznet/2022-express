Sir Tom Jones, 82, took to the stage and wowed a near sell-out crowd at the Open Air Theatre with some of his greatest hits. The legendary performer belted out tunes including Delilah and What's New Pussycat to Sexbomb and You Can Leave Your Hat On. The singer remained seated throughout his set as his walking stick could be seen behind him. It's not the first time the Welsh star has relied on a walking stick, having undergone hip replacement surgery back in 2017. Taking to social media today, Tom thanked fans writing: "It was a joy to play for you Scarborough!" Fans flocked to comment on the post, as they praised the singer after sharing their concerns. Cazzy field wrote: "You were amazing Sir Tom You beat all my expectations. Sending love and healing for your hip."

To listen to your songs is a real pleasure!"
