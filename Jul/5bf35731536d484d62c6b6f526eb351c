Manchester United managed to secure a comfortable win over Liverpool in front of a capacity crowd at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok on Monday. Erik ten Hag named a strong side to face United's greatest rivals and his determination to trouble the Reds was duly rewarded, with his players racing into a three-goal lead before the half-time whistle. Jadon Sancho opened the scoring for United after just 12 minutes, with the England ace firing home from close range after finding the ball at his feet in space. Fred went on to put the Red Devils two up with a delightful chip from the edge of the box that sailed over the head of Alisson Becker and into the back of the net. Anthony Martial struck again for United just moments later with a deft flick that bounced over the line as he raced through on goal, before Facundo Pellistri got in on the act to finish off a sweeping counter-attack in the closing stages of the match. The result marked a huge win for Ten Hag in his first outing as United's new manager, but it remains to be seen whether their stunning performance against Liverpool will become a regular occurrence during the Dutchman's time at Old Trafford.
