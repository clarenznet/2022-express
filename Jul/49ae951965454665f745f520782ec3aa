Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt is leading the way in the latest Conservative Home survey of the Next Tory Leader, with Kemi Badenoch close behind her. Ms Mordaunt has 20 percent, Ms Badenoch 19 percent, Rishi Sunak 12 percent, Suella Braverman ten percent and Liz Truss ten percent as well. The leadership candidates must achieve at least 20 nominations from other Tory MPs by 6pm tonight to progress to the vote. Among MPs, Mr Sunak is currently running first in declarations with 42 votes. But the Conservative Home poll suggests if his name was put to a vote of party members, he would fall behind Ms Mordaunt and Ms Badenoch. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
