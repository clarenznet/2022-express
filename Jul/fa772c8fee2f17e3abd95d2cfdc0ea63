Fortnite fans can download a brand new update for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and Android. The surprise new download is actually the second update of the week, following the release of version 21.20 on July 6. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a brief explanation about what to expect and when the download is coming to Nintendo Switch. As you can see from the tweet below, update 3.63 doesn't make any significant changes to the gameplay, but it should make the experience a little more stable. "We've released a maintenance patch for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Android devices to address stability issues," reads an Epic tweet. "Players will need to close their game to grab the update. We'll provide an update when this is available on Nintendo Switch." While it's not the most exciting update, the good news is that it doesn't require any server downtime. This means you can jump back into your game once the download is installed. The Nintendo Switch patch will most likely follow within the next 24-hours, so stay tuned for more updates. The latest download releases just days after the launch of update 3.63, which made sweeping changes across the board. The recent update makes changes to the Temple, which is now called Shuffled Shrines. It also added the Charge SMG, as well as a variety of new loading screens, new cosmetics and more. The introduction of Shuffled Shrines coincides with the release of the Indiana Jones skins and accompanying challenges. "Just in time for Indyâ€™s entrance, the Shuffled Shrines temple has been discovered on the Island! Explore this POI just west of The Joneses for an ancient architecture adventure.
