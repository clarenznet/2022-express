More than 2,000 Tory members have written to the Conservative Party chairman over the last 24 hours, demanding that Boris Johnson be included as an option on the leadership ballot. In 2019, the Prime Minister was by far the most popular choice to lead the party, with Tory MPs and members overwhelmingly backing him ahead of Jeremy Hunt. Mr Johnson is set to give his last performance at Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons today, marking an end to the Johnson era of British politics. But the campaign to put Boris on the ballot is growing, and members wrote to express their support for a petition organised by Lord Cruddas, a Tory donor, and former Conservative MEP David Campbell-Bannerman. Infighting in the Conservative Party was one of the main reasons why Mr Johnson announced his intention to step down. Over a period of six months, the Tories became embroiled in never-ending scandals, with tensions erupting when senior Government members resigned en masse earlier this month. However, the Prime Minister’s experience in Government, as well as his ability to win support around the UK, could see him win the Tory leadership contest - if he is allowed to take part. So, should Boris Johnson be given the chance to run to be prime minister again? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
