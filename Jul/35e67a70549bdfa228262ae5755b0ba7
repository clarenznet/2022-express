British holidaymakers travelling to Spain will soon fall into the same category as other non-EU visitors and may be asked to show proof of accommodation and a return ticket under incoming new rules. But as Britons reel at the news, one European commentator has urged the UK to “stop complaining” over Brexit changes. French political commentator Julian Hoez said on Twitter: “Brexit means Brexit, stop complaining to Europeans and start complaining to your MPs and local representatives.” His tweet comes as British travellers will need to prove they can spend at least £85 a day to enter Spain, one of Europe’s most popular holiday destinations. Additionally, under new rules expected to launch at the start of 2023, any non-EU tourists must apply for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) visa before travelling. The new document is expected to cost about €7 (£6) and will apply to anyone aged 18 to 70. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
