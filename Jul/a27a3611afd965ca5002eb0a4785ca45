Jennifer Garner, 50, looked amazing in casual wear as she was pictured on the film set for The Last Thing He Told Me. The Hollywood star will play Hannah Hall, a woman who forms an unexpected relationship with her stepdaughter, as she searches for her husband who disappeared. She looked effortlessly radiant in green jeans and a white low-cut t-shirt. This comes a week after her ex-husband Ben tied the knot with Jennifer Lopez. The pair previously dated two decades ago and were even engaged in 2002 before they abruptly called off the wedding. His first wife, who is also called Jennifer, shares three children with Ben including Seraphina, 16, Violet, 13, and Samuel, ten. They announced their split in 2015 after ten years of marriage.
