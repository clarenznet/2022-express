Nuno Tavares looks set to become the first of many departures at Arsenal ahead of the new season as Atalanta close in on a loan deal for the full-back. The Portuguese defender only joined the Gunners from Benfica last year but his chances of playing regularly have diminished following the arrival of Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. Tavares enjoyed a run of games in the final stretches of the season but it's clear he will be one of the names in reserve if he stays in north London next season. Atalanta are now looking to finalise a deal for the 22-year-old after moving ahead of Brighton, Marseille and Real Sociedad in the race for his services. Arsenal are yet to decide if they will include an option to buy within the agreement as they still consider Tavares a player for the future. The player's exit - whether temporary or potentially permanent - is set to be the first of many departures in north London this summer.
