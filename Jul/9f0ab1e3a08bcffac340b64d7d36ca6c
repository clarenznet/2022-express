Chelsea are reportedly 'very close' to signing Sevilla defender Jules Kounde to get revenge over Barcelona. Barca have beaten Chelsea to the signing of Raphinha but the Blues look set to win the race for Kounde. Thomas Tuchel is still in the market for defenders following the arrival of Kalidou Koulibaly. Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen both left Stamford Bridge on free transfers at the end of their contracts. Cesar Azpilicueta could also be on his way before the window shuts. Chelsea are in talks over signing Paris Saint-Germain star Presnel Kimpbembe. But it appears they are still keen on signing his France team-mate Kounde. Spanish football journalist Manu Sainz says Chelsea are hopeful of completing a deal for the 23-year-old next week. Barca are also interested in Kounde but Chelsea look set to get their man. Sainz tweeted on Sunday: "Kounde is very close to being transferred to Chelsea.

Xavi spoke with the player and convinced him to go to Barca, but Chelsea bets more strongly." Barca signed Raphinha from Leeds last week despite Chelsea agreeing a fee with their Premier League rivals earlier in the window for the Brazil winger. But Chelsea are set to get their own back by securing Kounde. Kounde has been linked with a move to west London for the last three transfer windows. A deal was on the cards last summer but Chelsea were not willing to match Sevilla's asking price for the player. However, with just two years remaining on his contract at the La Liga club, he could well be on his way this summer. Chelsea only completed a deal for Koulibaly on Friday.
