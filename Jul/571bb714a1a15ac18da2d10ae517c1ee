The Russian President unleashed a furious tirade at much of the rest of the world, claiming the "collaborative West is the direct instigator and perpetrator of what is happening today". In televised remarks to parliamentary leaders, Vladimir Putin said: "Today we hear that we have started the war in the Donbas, Ukraine. No, it was unleashed by the collective West, which organised and supported the unconstitutional armed coup in Ukraine in 2014, and then encouraged and justified the genocide against people in Donbas. "The collaborative West is the direct instigator and perpetrator of what is happening today. "If the West wanted to provoke a conflict in order to move onto a new stage of fighting with Russia, to a new stage of containing our country, then we can say it has succeeded. "The war has been unleashed. Sanctions have been imposed." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
