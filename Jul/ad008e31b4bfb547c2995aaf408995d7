Sir Cliff Richard returned to Wimbledon today in an eye-catching snakeskin blazer. The 81-year-old looked stylish in the grey jacket, which he paired with a matching pinstripe shirt and tie. Cliff looked much younger than his years as he smiled for the cameras upon arriving on day eight of the tennis tournament. He laughed off the recent cruel backlash to his acapella rendition of Summer Holiday, which he performed on the stands last week. @fpl_pie had tweeted: "This centre court nonsense on BBC1 might be the most nauseating thing I've ever seen, and I've had it on mute since Cliff Richard started singing #Wimbledon." UKtraveljourno added: "Please, god, don't say Cliff Richard is about to sing #wimbledon #centrecourt #100years."
