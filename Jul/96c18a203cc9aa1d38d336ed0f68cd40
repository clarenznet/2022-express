British number one Cameron Norrie thrashed Steve Johnson in straight sets on Centre Court to advance to the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in his career. Norrie's American opponent put up a sturdy fight in the first set before capitulating in the final two, allowing the Brit to close the show in style. There was no sign of nerves despite what was at stake for Norrie, given his poor record in the third round of major tournaments. Johnson held his own in the first set before being broken at the final hurdle, allowing his 26-year-old to take it 6-4. Johnson only won a single game from that moment on, losing the final nine on the spin as Norrie notched a bagel to close out the match. By that point, the American was desperate to get back to the dressing room, with microphones picking up the phrase, 'Of all the days...'. Norrie is the first male Brit to make it to the fourth round at Wimbledon in five years, and will now gear up to face another American in Tommy Paul - ranked 32nd in the world. "It feels really good, especially here at Wimbledon, at home," said Norrie. "First time in the second week of a Grand Slam and I couldn't be happier, especially with all my friends and family watching me. It's good timing that they're here! I enjoyed that match today and it was a bit less stressful than the last round for my squad. "I'm enjoying playing at this level, the process and enjoying improving with my coach and my team. We all have the same goals and we're all pushing each other - it's been a lot of fun and I want to keep going and keep ticking all boxes. I'm as ready as I can be - I'm training as hard as I can and it's been a tricky grass season and I've peaked at the right time. I'm feeling good and moving well on the court so I'm as ready as I can be." FOLLOW THE MATCH AS IT HAPPENED BELOW...
