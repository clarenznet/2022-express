Lando Norris has been forced out of practice just hours before qualifying at the Austrian Grand Prix as his car caught fire. Norris came to a rest just before turn six, complaining his car was alight over the team radio. The McLaren driver said his car was in limp mode during the opening part of the session, suggesting there was an error. Usually, his engineers would be keen for Norris to get the car back to the garage but the Briton made it clear wanted to stop urgently after claiming his seat was “smoking”. He explained: “I'm on fire, I need to stop. Race engineer Will Joseph added: “If you’re on fire and need to stop do it." Norris responded: “It's smoking from underneath my seat mate so I'd rather get out alright."

The team could have still returned to the track in FP1 if they were able to recover their car and fix the damage but the Briton did not return to action. Norris was only able to complete 14 laps, half the number of his Alpha Tauri rival Yuki Tsunoda as the battle for fourth in the constructors' standings heats up. Usually, the team would have an extra session this afternoon to dial in their car ahead of qualifying tomorrow. But, McLaren will not have that luxury with Austria’s Sprint weekend format meaning qualifying will take place in just a few hours. McLaren engineers were also seen frantically working on the back of Daniel Ricciardo’s car in what appeared to be a nightmare session.
