Ann Marie Cash was given 18 points, fines totalling £25,646 and was also disqualified from driving for 18 months after being found guilty of 33 separate speeding offences across south Wales. Between August and October 2021, a Nissan X Trail owned by Cash and bearing Irish plates committed 33 speeding offences in the South Wales Police area. According to WalesOnline, these offences included 30 on Newport Road, Rumney Hill and one each on Greenway Road, North Road and Newport Road junction with Rover Way, all in Cardiff. An investigation was started by GoSafe, the Welsh Road Casualty reduction partnership, and officers were alerted to the car being stopped for displaying false plates. It had then been seized as it had no insurance and the driver had no license. All 33 notices of intended prosecution letters were sent to Cash after GoSafe established the correct registration and address for the car. After receiving no response to the letters, all offences were referred to Cardiff Magistrates Court. Cash, of Lynmouth Crescent, Llanrumney, later contacted the court and pleaded guilty to the offences. Despite being invited to attend due to the possibility of disqualification, Cash did not do so and the case was heard in her absence at Cardiff Magistrates Court on Monday, May 23, this year. All 33 offences were proven with each one carrying a fine of £660 with court costs and victim surcharges. The offences were not consolidated and the court ordered each offence to be paid, meaning the total costs were a £21,780 fine, £3,610 costs and a £256 victim surcharge. Cash also received 18 points and an 18-month disqualification from driving.
