A head-to-head debate between the two, who are both hoping to become the country's next Prime Minister following the stepping down of Boris Johnson, will air on Tuesday. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss will join The Sun's political editor Harry Cole from TalkTV, the home of Piers Morgan's show, Uncensored, from 6pm.
