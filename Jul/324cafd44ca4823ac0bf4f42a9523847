However, the pre-tax loss for the three months to the end of June, including a £36million blow due to adverse currency movements, was an improvement on the £318million loss the airline posted for the same period last year. Revenues for the three months to the end of June rocketed from £213million to £1.8billion. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said that despite the chaos at airports in the UK and Europe, it flew 22 million passengers over the third quarter, seven times more than it did last year, hitting 92 per cent capacity on its flights. The low-cost airline managed to fly 95 per cent of its planned schedule this quarter, although staff shortages combined with the "unprecedented ramp up" in demand post-Covid. EasyJet was forced to cut thousands of flights to stabilise its operations, though Lundgren said that the problems of earlier this summer were a "one-off". He added: "We've taken action to build the additional resilience needed this summer and the operation has now normalised."
