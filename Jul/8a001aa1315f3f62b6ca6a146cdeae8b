The Red Arrows aerobatic team will debut at the Farnborough Airshow in a stunning flypast this morning. The team - which has become a staple for most British celebrations - have had a busy month, with their first displays commencing from July 2. Their latest carries them between their Fairford and Scampton bases, and past crowds at the Farnborough show. They set off in just a few short hours, following a path that brings them in a wide arc over the southwest. The teams have a packed schedule that starts in just over an hour, lifting off from RAF Fairford at 10.16am. For just over half an hour they will embark on a route over the area, bringing them to Farnborough by 10.30am. The planes will exit the show over locations such as Swindon, Reading and Winslow before landing again at RAF Scampton before 11am.

Pilots have a couple of days off before they get started on their final few displays of the month. They next lift off after a short break on July 20 for a dual display. From then to July 28, aerobatics fans can catch them another five times. The final Red Arrows displays of July include: Red Arrow crews conduct three types of display during their flypasts, starting with today's "full" routine that carries them on a loop only practicable when cloud is above 5,500ft. They carry out the second "rolling" type when the cloud base is lower than 5,500ft but above 2,500, forcing them to roll instead of loop. The flat display takes the teams on a series of flypasts and more daring turns when cloud cover is below 2,500ft.
