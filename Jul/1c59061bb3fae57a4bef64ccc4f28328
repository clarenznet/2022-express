Martin Lewis, 50, was joined by his wife Lara Lewington, 43, as he collected his CBE (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire). He looked very dapper in a blue suit as he posed with Lara who stunned in a plunging red dress. She matched her mini red dress with a matching red fascinator, as she accessorised with a gold clutch. Lara shared snaps from the memorable occasion to her 53,900 Twitter followers. She captioned the post: "Congratulations @MartinSLewis CBE. Couldnâ€™t be prouder." Also posting photos from the day, Martin penned on Instagram: "And what a delight to share the day with my wondeful [sic] wife @laralewlew (especially as I still can't smile properly after my dental surgery, and she can do it beautifully for me). "Just a shame mini MSE was too young to be allowed to join."
