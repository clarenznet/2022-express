Alex Jones and Jermaine Jenas welcomed two Hollywood stars onto Monday’s The One Show as David Harbour and Bill Pullman discussed starring in Theresa Rebeck’s Mad House. However, BBC viewers took to Twitter to complain the show had not allocated enough time to the interview. Stranger Things actor David and Bill joined Alex and Jermaine in the studio from the beginning of the instalment. However, it wasn’t until later on in the programme that the presenters quizzed the actors on their new West End show. @JoannePape tweeted: “#TheOneShow spent way too much time on the boring Commonwealth Games than the amazing guests they had in the studio. What a wasted opportunity.” @chrisb99_uk questioned: “What’s the point of having guests on but not even talking to them?  20 mins in #theoneshow.” Read more: William Shatner distracts The One Show fans with 'ageless' appearance    “Where the hell is David Harbour!? Give that sexy beast some b****y airtime, I need more than 5 mins #TheOneShow,” @loopy_ju added. “Two ‘A’ Listers sitting 20 minutes in the studio listening and watching this and being interviewed by JJ. Soooo embarrassing. #theoneshow,” @paboy113 remarked. @theproperKP tweeted: “#theoneshow have 2 massive A list stars on and have spent about 52 seconds talking to them.” (sic) One viewer replied to another who was disappointed to have missed the Stranger Things actor.    @Claire_250 quipped: “@BBCOne Well, it was kind of blink and you'll miss him. Ridiculously short amount of time given over  to #DavidHarbour and #BillPullman. #TheOneShow.” During the interview, Jermaine joked that the viewers “would kill him” if he didn’t ask David about Strangers Things. “Did you expect it to be such a huge success?” The One Show presenter asked. “Not at all,” the Hollywood star candidly admitted.

David explained: “We play father and son, he’s a horrible person and I’m a very sympathetic character. The Stranger Things star described Bill’s character as a “patriarch” and “horrible man”. “He’s divvying up at the end of his life this money that he thinks he has and I’m the son who’s a bit unstable that’s always taken care of him and the other family members descend onto the house and it becomes this family comedy/drama.” The One Show airs on BBC One on weekdays at 7pm.
