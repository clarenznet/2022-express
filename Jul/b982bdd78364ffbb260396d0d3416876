She was best known to millions as grandmother Blossom Jackson, who dispensed sage advice as matriarch of the Jackson family in long-running soap EastEnders. She left after three years in 1997 because of the hectic filming schedule but returned briefly in 2010 for the funeral of her on-screen great-grandson Billie. In 1972 Hammond played Lady Macbeth in Peter Coe's groundbreaking production of the Shakespeare play, with an all-black cast, set in Africa. She co-founded the Talawa Theatre Company in 1986 to provide more stage opportunities for black artists and appeared in its first production, a retelling of The Black Jacobins, by CLR James, about the Haitian revolution. Hammond was born Mavis Chin in Jamaica, to a Chinese father and Jamaican mother, and moved to London on a scholarship in 1959. She worked for an architect's firm by day and studied at the City Literary Institute at night, securing a scholarship to Rada. After graduating in 1964 she changed her name to Mona Hammond to avoid being stereotyped and spent two years at the Royal National Theatre. Her television roles included The Sweeney, Desmond's, Holby City, Death In Paradise and DoctorWho. She also played MabelThompson in The Archers on Radio 4. Hammond was awarded an OBE in 2015 and in 2018 received the Women of the World lifetime achievement award for her theatre career and for championing black British actors. The following year she was given an honorary Rada fellowship. Hammond is survived by son Matthew by her former husband Michael Saunders.
