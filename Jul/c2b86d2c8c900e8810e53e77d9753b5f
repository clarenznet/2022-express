Lewis Hamilton, 37, put his eccentric sense of fashion on display as he stepped out in a pink ensemble yesterday. The Formula 1 driver commanded attention as he made an appearance at the French Grand Prix in Le Castellet. He donned a two-tone pink and red Burberry shirt with the words 'Universal Passport' written across it, along with some matching red trousers. He also donned a pair of black shoes that featured a white print and some round sunglasses, as well as a black baseball cap. Lewis could be seen strolling the paddocks ahead of the race this weekend.
