A committee investigating the riot was told the outgoing president refused to criticise the mob protesting Joe Biden’s election in January 2021, despite his children’s pleas. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-chief of staff Mark Meadows tried to persuade him to speak out. His son Donald Jr said: “He has got to condemn this s*** ASAP.”  But Trump, 76, ignored them as he sat at his “usual spot” viewing Fox News coverage of the clash, which left six people dead. He also posted tweets which could have inflamed the violence, the probe heard. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of a committee, said it was a “supreme violation of his oath” that left “a stain on our history”.
