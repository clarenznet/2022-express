Countdown legend Carol Vorderman, 61, has put on another incredibly ageless display in a series of stunning Instagram snaps, before embarking on an active day out in Wales.  The star showed that her regular workouts and love of walking around the picturesque beaches in her hometown have been paying off, as she donned a skintight ensemble.  Carol grinned for the camera as she posed for a selection of cheeky selfies before going on a “big hike” in aid of cancer charity, Prostate Cymru.  The maths expert posed with her biceps flexed while showing off her gym-honed pert derriere in fitted black leggings, complete with white “go faster stripes”.  Carol captioned the sexy pics: “Wearing my @stronger go faster stripes for our @pcbigwalk for @ProstateCymru this morning.  “50 of us off on a big hike....ending up at a rugby club!!! Where else. More news and views as we go. Ambassador for @ProstateCymru #savethemalesinwales.”  Sandbuff1234 was one of many fans who gushed over Carol’s age-defying appearance, as she commented: “Looking fantastic Carol….. life begins at 60 # thenewforty…..”  prd502021 enthused: “Stunning figure Carol.”
