Young Princes Charlotte appeared in a short video with dad Prince William today wishing the Lionesses luck ahead of the UEFA Women's EURO England 2022 final. Princess Charlotte looked lovely in a navy short sleeved t-shirt. This was decorated with small white polkadots. It also had a scooped neck. Despite the royals having access to a global wardrobe, the little Princess' t-shirt was only €14.95 (around £12.50). READ MORE: What kind of royal will Prince Louis be according to astrology? This was from Losan Happy Fashion. The young Princess wore her long hair down over her shoulders. She matched her dad who opted for a casual royal blue shirt which had the top few buttons undone. The little Princess channelled Kate Middleton who is no stranger to a navy and white polka dot dress. At the Wimbledon final, fashionable royal mum Kate stunned in a navy peplum dress. This was covered in white polka dots, just like Charlotte's. The Duchess' number was by one of her favourite designers, Alessandra Rich. It had ruched sleeves and a bow on the bodice.
