Officers had been desperately searching for Hina Bashir, 21, who vanished last week from her home in Ilford, east London. While formal identification is yet to take place, a body was discovered in nearby Havering yesterday morning and police have since arrested a 36-year-old man in connection with the death. The suspect has been questioned on suspicion of murder, Essex Live reports. Hina's family, from Ilford, are being supported by specialist officers. Metropolitan Police said it was "confident" the man and Hina knew each other. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, from the Metropolitan Police’s Specialist Crime Command, said: "My thoughts are with Hina’s family who have suffered a terrible loss. We will provide them with whatever support we can. "This has been a fast-moving investigation and a man is in custody. We are confident that this man and Hina were known to each other. "As our investigation progresses we will be working to develop our understanding of what happened to Hina, not just in recent days but in the weeks prior to this terrible incident. I would urge anyone who believes they have information which could assist us to come forward."  The force has not yet confirmed where exactly the body was found.
