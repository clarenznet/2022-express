  Alessandra, 41, stunned in a colourful beach coverup, which featured a pink and yellow striped design. The garment’s plunging neckline allowed the model’s cleavage-bearing bandeau bikini to be visible underneath. Alessandra included another picture which showed her wearing the olive green swimwear close up, as she shielded her eyes with some stylish sunglasses. She accessorised with a beaded necklace and a few loose bracelets, while she alternated between a loose bun and natural windswept look for her hair throughout the day.
