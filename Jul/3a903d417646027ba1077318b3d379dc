Russian-born tennis star Elena Rybakina became Wimbledon champion on Saturday after she beat third seed Ons Jabeur in three sets. The 23-year-old, who now represents Kazakhstan, clinched her first Grand Slam title in just under two hours, coming through an entertaining clash on Centre Court. Wimbledon took action earlier this year in response to Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine by banning Russian and Belarusian players from competing at the All England Club in 2022. Rybakina's run to the Wimbledon trophy was therefore tinged with controversy, given that she switched her international allegiance just a few years ago. "I donâ€™t mean to get into politics here but she is Russian, right?" said John McEnroe before the match. "It is sort of strange because of this whole ordeal of not allowing the Russians to play." It was Jabeur who made the early running, breaking Rybakina's monstrous serve twice to take the first set 6-3. But the 6ft Kazakh was superb after gaining a foothold in the match, storming to the final two sets to get her hands on a Grand Slam trophy for the first time. Naturally, Jabeur was devastated after losing her first major final, while Rybakina's reaction was subdued considering the magnitude of the occasion. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES AS THEY HAPPENED BELOW...
