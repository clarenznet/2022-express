Daniela Elser pointed to changes in the Kensington Palace staff, including the Cambridges’ communications secretary, which indicates “one conclusion”. She wrote: “Right now there are changes going on behind the scenes personnel-wise at the Kensington Palace office of William and wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge which point to one conclusion: They are preparing, quietly, for the fight of their lives.” The Duke and Duchess hired ex-NBC VP of global communications, Lee Thompson, earlier this year. Ms Elser then referenced the Duke of Sussex’s upcoming memoirs, due to be released in the coming months. The “royal tell-all to end all tell-all” does not yet have a fixed publication date, but will have “loins back in London [...] girding right about now”. She added that “a p***ed off prince who seems to enjoy score-settling” is likely to be weighing on the minds of William and Kate as they await the “wholly truthful” account from Prince Harry.
