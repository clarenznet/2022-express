After all, every spill, splatter, and accident that happens while cooking using the oven stays inside this kitchen appliance - and especially on the glass door - until it is cleaned up. But as the inside of an oven cannot be cleaned whilst it is still hot, by the time the oven cools down, those messes are out of mind so debris, grime, and grease can really build up. Thankfully, cleaning a glass oven door isn't impossible as cleaning experts have suggested a “natural” yet “effective” way to clean oven door glass with white vinegar. The cleaning experts at Ovenu said: “Oven door glass is built to withstand high temperatures and allows us to easily take a peek to see how our food is coming along. “Unfortunately, over time this window can collect grime and grease stains, which can render it all but useless. “Whilst it might be tempting to work around a small stain, this can get baked onto the glass after each use, making it more difficult to clean in the long run.” To combat this, the experts have noted that the “best way” is to use white vinegar with a dash of baking soda.
