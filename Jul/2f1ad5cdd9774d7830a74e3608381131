Joe Biden, whose family heritage is Irish, made the comments while on his first trip to the Middle East since taking office in 2021. He said: “The background of my family is Irish American. And we have a long history not fundamentally unlike the Palestinian people, with Great Britain and their attitude toward Irish Catholics over the years for 400 years.” Previously, the US President has commented on the UK’s Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland with the EU, where he ruled out a US-UK trade deal if the Good Friday agreement was threatened. He wrote on Twitter that any US-UK trade deal “must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.” However, Mr Biden’s latest anti-British comments have led to fierce backlash from social media users. Nile Gardiner, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, called out Mr Biden over the comments and questioned his views on the special relationship enjoyed between the UK and US. Mr Gardiner said: “Disgraceful anti British comments from Joe Biden. A reminder why this clueless US President is no friend of Great Britain.” Mr Biden’s views are a stark contrast to former president Donald Trump, who spoke of his love for the UK and claimed to have predicted Brexit before it happened. So, should Britain trust Joe Biden after his latest statement? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
