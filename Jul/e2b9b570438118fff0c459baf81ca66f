RAF pilot Sergeant Bruce Smeaton was on a training exercise above Cutsyke, Castleford in West Yorkshire on May 9-10 1941 when his Bristol Blenheim suffered an engine failure. As the aircraft was going down close to housing and a school, it is believed that Sergeant Smeaton chose to manually crash it in a nearby field, ultimately leading to his death. Sgt Smeaton's heroic actions saved the lives of hundreds of people, reports Yorkshire Live. His base was in Church Fenton, a village in North Yorkshire and he was only 22 when he died. Since then, Castleford has done a lot to remember him, including the naming of a street, Bruce Smeaton Way, after the hero.  Originally from Surrey, Sgt Smeaton is now remembered for his heroic actions in Castleford, with a statue now being unveiled. The statue was unveiled by members of Bruce Smeaton’s family on Bruce Smeaton Way in Cutsyke, Castleford. Along with the statue there is a seating area and a board explaining what happened on the night he died. Altofts and Whitworth ward councillor, Coun Jacquie Speight, said: "Sgt Smeaton was an incredibly brave man who made the ultimate sacrifice to save others. "We are all incredibly proud of his actions and it is wonderful to have a statue and memorial board to educate future generations about his actions." Wakefield Council provided £6,000 of funding for the statue from Local Capital Grants and was supported by all the councillors for the Altofts and Whitworth ward, Coun Jacquie Speight, Coun Jo Hepworth and Coun Josie Farrar alongside the Bruce Smeaton Memorial Group. The memorial group were the ones who first applied for the funding. Taylor Wimpey developers also donated the land and £500.
