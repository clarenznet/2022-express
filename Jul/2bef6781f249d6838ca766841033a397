The Good Morning Britain star, 55, was appearing at the Tric Awards in London when she opened up about his condition today. Derek contracted coronavirus in March 2020 and spent more than a year in hospital. In April last year, the dad-of-two returned to the couple's family home to be with Kate and their children Darcey, 16, and son Billy, 12. His health woes were documented in two candid ITV films, including Finding Derek and the emotional follow-up Caring For Derek. Kate has since addressed her husband's health and explained he is back in the hospital. She told The Sun: "He's OK, he's back in hospital actually, so that's a development. There we are."
