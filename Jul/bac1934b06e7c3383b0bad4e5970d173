England booked their place in the semi-finals of Euro 2022 on Wednesday night as they defeated Spain 2-1 following an emphatic comeback at the Amex Community Stadium in Brighton. Georgia Stanway proved to be the matchwinner as she scored a screamer in extra-time which ultimately proved to be the difference. Spain dominated the early stages of the match on the south coast as they caused England all sorts of problems. And they eventually went ahead in the 54th minute as Esther Gonzalez struck after good work from substitute Athenea del Castillo. But England refused to buckle and continued to push forward in search of an equaliser. And it came with six minutes of normal time remaining as Ella Toone volleyed in Alessia Russo's knock down. The Lionesses then took full advantage of their home advantage as Stanway raced forward with the ball and unleashed a thumping effort into the roof of the net. Sarina Wiegman's Lionesses were superb form in the group stages, beating Austria 1-0, Norway 8-0 and Northern Ireland 5-0. And they are now favourites to lift the trophy for the first time in their history ahead of their semi-final against either Sweden or Belgium, which is due to take place next Tuesday at Bramall Lane.
