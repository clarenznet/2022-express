TikTok star Ed Matthews has called out YouTuber AnEsonGib after stopping fellow influencer Simple Simon in the main event of Saturday’s Kingpyn boxing event. Matthews, 19, knocked out Simon, 52, at the O2 Indigo in London after just 48 seconds of action. The far younger man landed a right-hand early doors that stunned his opponent. But despite clearly being hurt Simon poured on the pressure as he walked on to multiple shots before eventually being sent to the canvas by a left hook from Matthews. Simon was unable to meet the count and the contest was called off in the first round of their grudge match as the crowd was sent into an absolute frenzy. Talking after the fight, a clearly excited Matthews told SecondsOut that he breaks more of a sweat ‘breaking girls' backs’ and called for a fight with AnEsonGib next. He said: “It was easy I’m not going to lie I wanted it to go on longer. 30 seconds? Come on at least two minutes. I’m annoyed I was loving every second of that. Bruv I’ll break more of a sweat doing one of them tings tonight, do you know what I mean? “Bruv I break more a sweat breaking girls backs. F***ing loved every second of it, that was mad I’m just waiting for the next fight now let’s f***ing have it now geez.” Matthews’ friend HSTIKKYTOKKY then said: “AnEsonGib bruv, stop hiding from him." Before Matthews added: “You don’t want smoke, you don’t want smoke.” MORE BOXING NEWS...
