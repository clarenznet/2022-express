Bosses had refused to promote Rachel Sunderland because they thought she was “too old to quit” and would stay “no matter how she was treated.” She was deemed a low “flight risk” by managers, it was said. Rachel, said to be in her early 50s, was repeatedly passed over for promotion in favour of colleagues with less experience until she felt forced to resign, a tribunal in Bristol heard. She has now won claims of unfair dismissal and age discrimination.
