As part of a plan to transform Border Force, the Home Office is planning to introduce a Permission to Travel scheme from next year. Anyone who wants to visit the UK will need permission before they set off. British and Irish passport holders will not need to do anything, but everyone else will need to apply for a visa or Electronic Travel Authorisation. The Home Secretary said: "As Home Secretary I have been focused on taking back control of our immigration system through my New Plan for Immigration. This includes ensuring we have a border that is fit for the 21st century which allows travellers to get a visa and pass through the border easily, while maintaining national security."
