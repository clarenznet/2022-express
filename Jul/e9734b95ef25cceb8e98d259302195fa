In the stunning black and white snap, a topless Cara can be seen covering her assests with her hands while shooting a sultry stare at the camera. Speaking about celebrating London pride, Cara said: "Trans rights, women’s rights, they’re all human rights. "This isn’t about, ‘Oh, it’s not my job because I’m not part of the community.’ It’s all of our jobs to stand up for each other." The star's hair had been styled into a wet look which was partially covering her face as she wore a silver contraption around her lower half.
