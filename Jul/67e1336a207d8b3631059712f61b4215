Liam Addison, 30, suffered fatal chest injuries after the crash on the A16 in the Lincolnshire Wolds in June 2020. Mr Addison, from Grainthorpe, Lincs, was on a ride with fellow biker Adam Clover, 31. Lincoln Crown Court heard that Mr Addison's 1000cc Yamaha was travelling at 140mph some 250 yards before he hit the ambulance. Clover played no part in causing his friend's death, but he was jailed for 10 months for dangerous driving.
