The Brexit Opportunities Minister said he will instead back "the most viable candidate who can unite the Right of the party". He said: "I am not standing. I want to unite rather than further fracture the Right." Previous reports stated that he was considering running as a "continuity" candidate to defend Boris Johnson's legacy. Mr Rees-Mogg was understood to have contacted a number of Tory MPs yesterday for advice. Steve Baker MP, campaign manager for Suella Braverman, said that he warned the Cabinet minister against standing as he would not win a general election. He told BBC Radio 4, before Mr Rees-Mogg announced his decision, that too many similar applicants also pose a "danger of fragmentation". "We'll see whether he actually does [run]," Mr Baker said. "I love Jacob like a brother but he wouldn't win a general election, I'm quite sure, so I hope to dissuade himâ€¦It's a nonsense to have candidates standing all over the place."  At the weekend, Mr Rees-Mogg had won the unexpected support of former Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten. Mr Rotten, 66 - real name John Lydon - backed him for Tory leader, telling Talk TV: "I love that World-War-Two-respect, put-Britain-first attitude he has. "In every interview I've ever seen him do, he has been on the floor with his humour.And I think he's just genuinely a nice person." The MP for North East Somerset said he was "honoured" to have the punk rocker's endorsement.
