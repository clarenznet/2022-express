Kevin Bacon, 64, and his wife of more than 30 years looked smitten as they posed together for the cameras on the red carpet. The couple attended on Sunday night the premiere of Kevin’s new Peacock film, They/Them at the closing night of the 2022 Outfest LA LGBTQ+ Film Festival. Kyra looked fabulous in a lavender long-sleeved midi dress that cinched in at the waist and the actress paired with some brown heeled sandals. Kevin also looked elegant in a grey plaid suit and black shoes, which he complemented with some tinted glasses.
