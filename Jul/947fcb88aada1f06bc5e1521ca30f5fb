A combination of Covid absences among staff, the hot weather and ongoing delays in handing over patients to A&E has left the 10 trusts struggling to cope. The West Midlands trust said it had been on the highest level, known as REAP 4, for a few months. The South Central trust said: "We continue to prioritise our response to those patients with life-threatening and serious emergencies. "There will be delays in responding to other patients." Martin Flaherty, of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said: "The sector is under intense pressure. "The highest level is normally reserved for only major incidents or short periods of unusual demand."
