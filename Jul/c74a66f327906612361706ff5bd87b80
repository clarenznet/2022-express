Reese Witherspoon, 46, looked phenomenal as she stepped out looking just like her character, Elle Woods, from the cult 2000s film Legally Blonde. The actress donned a show-stopping hot pink gown as she made an appearance at the New York City premiere of Where the Crawdads Sing. Reese, who produced the on-screen adaptation of the best-selling novel, paired the A-line midi dress with some barely-there gold strappy heels. She exuded radiance as she smiled for the cameras in a minimal makeup look featuring a bold hot pink lip and wearing her wavy blonde tresses down.
