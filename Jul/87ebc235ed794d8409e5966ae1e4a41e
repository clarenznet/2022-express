Penny Lancaster, 51, looked amazing in floral as she put on a cosy display with her husband Rod Stewart, 77. Rod could be seen leaning on his wife as she posed for a picture during their USA family trip. The Loose Women panellist showed off her ample assets in a floral mini dress, while Rod sported a blue and white unbuttoned shirt. He matched the shirt with tight white jeans and a white shell necklace. Penny captioned the loving snap in view of her 158,000 Instagram followers: "@salondeningmanila on a very hot, sultry night in New York."
