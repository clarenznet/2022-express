Liz Hurley, 57, stunned in the plunging floral dress as she arrived at Goodwood Festival with her friend, Henry Birtles. The floral print, along with the plunging neckline, accentuated the model's ample assets. The mid-length dress also drew in at the waist, further highlighting the model's svelte figure. She accompanied her gorgeous attire with a gold clutch bag, strappy heels and a pink floral fascinator hat. Liz also wore large square statement glasses to shield herself from the sunny weather. Meanwhile, author Henry looked dapper for the event in a navy suit and blue tie.
