The heir to the throne said: "I used to come with my grandmother every year. She would be so pleased it keeps going." Charles, who took up regular visits to the event after the Queen Mum died in 2002, looked thrilled to be back among the flowers as the show reopened on the Queen's Norfolk estate for the first time since the Covid pandemic. And the Royal Couple were a big hit with the crowds as they went walkabout, shaking hands with veterans and members of the public. Camilla looked impressed with a crocheted crown while Charles even remembered to stop and smell the roses.
