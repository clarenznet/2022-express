Chloe Madeley, 35, shared the picture on Instagram, leaving her 252,000 followers stunned as she could be seen looking out to the distance on the balcony with her body turned to the side. She put her baby bump on full display, with her long blonde tresses covering her cleavage. She captioned the post: "I was asked on IG this morning if I’m excited to get back in shape post-pregnancy. I nearly skipped over the question so I didn’t have to answer it and undoubtedly have my answer be misconstrued and misjudged. "Because the answer is yes. I am extremely excited to rehab my body postnatally; my core, my pelvic floor, my glutes, everything that has had to shift, make way and change for my little potato will need to be rehabbed and nursed back to health. I am excited to PATIENTLY watch my physique change again, too. "That doesn’t mean I don’t LOVE my pregnant body…clearly I do. "I work in the body. I have done it for a decade. I’ve been passionate about it for longer than that. It was that passion that saw me change my career, lifestyle, body and mental health.I love a performance goal. I love a physique goal. I love what I do." She continued: "Today, this love is CONSTANTLY and CONSISTENTLY deemed as hatred for your female form. Deemed as insecurity born of the patriarchy and or the media. It is SO frowned upon for women to have body goals." The presenter then explained how the body "grows and changes" as well as explaining how "scared" she was to post the revealing snap. She concluded: "Funny that, isn’t it? The fear of sharing a positive relationship with your body is matched on either side of present day love and acceptance, or later date goals to evolve, because so many will project onto it their negative opinions. So screw it, celebrate your body, even if it doesn’t fit the trend right now."
