Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria showed off her enviable figure in bikini photos posted to her Instagram account. The 47-year-old looked impossibly toned and trim as she posed up a storm on a boat in the ocean. Eva has been island hopping around Italy, donning various swimsuits in different colours as she soaks up the sun. She was joined by her family, which includes husband José Bastón and son Santiago, four. Eva is also stepmum to José’s three other children from a previous relationship. Little Santiago could be seen having a lot of fun as he helped to steer the boat. As Eva almost spilled out of her bikini top, it became evident how she stays so in shape - the actress posted a video of herself working out with a personal trainer, even while on holiday in the sun.
