Jeremy Clarkson, 62, and his girlfriend Lisa Hogan, 49, put on a loved up display during their romantic getaway to the South of France. The Clarkson’s Farm presenter looked joyous yesterday as he shared a hug with his model partner. The pair put on a cosy display as they shared a kiss as the pair took a stroll across the beach pier towards celebrity hotspot, Club 55. Lisa could be seen in pictures of their outing placing an arm around Jeremy to share an embrace, while in turn, he put an arm around her while walking on the pier.
