Almost half of those who are supporting family members financially will struggle to continue offering support over the next year, while even more are concerned about how soaring inflation will affect them, research from Canada Life shows. Technical director Andrew Tully said the Bank of Mum and Dad has played a significant role in helping loved ones but the trend could now go into reverse: "As inflation continues to soar, families are being forced to make tough financial decisions." He said people should think carefully before helping out younger family members if it puts their own retirement at risk. "You need to keep money for care fees and other costs in later life." The squeeze makes it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder, with the average home now costing around Â£277,000, Land Registry figures show. Full-time workers can now expect to spend an incredible 9.1 times their annual earnings on a home and Sophia Guy-White, co-founder of specialist mortgage lender Generation Home, said: "With so many factors stacked against first-time buyers, it is easy to think the doors of the property market are completely slammed shut." Yet buying a home remains the number one reason for helping out children, favoured by almost half, far ahead of higher education, a wedding or a car. Many parents and grandparents would prefer to offer financial help in the shape of a formal loan, rather than a gift, Guy-White added.
