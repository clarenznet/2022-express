Fifty-two people from 18 countries died and hundreds more were injured in the simultaneous suicide attacks on three Tube trains and a London bus at the height of the morning rush hour. The bombings were carried out by four British supporters of al-Qaeda. 75 years ago (1947), a United States Army Air Forces weather balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. This led conspiracy theorists to claim the “flying disc” was actually a UFO, whose extraterrestrial occupants had been recovered by the US military, who then covered it up. 11 years ago (2011), the Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its 33rd and final mission, bringing Nasa’s fourth human spaceflight programme to an end after 20 years. During its time, Atlantis had orbited the earth 4,848 times and travelled nearly 126,000,000 miles. Nasa estimated between 750,000 and one million people turned out to watch it.
