Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, showed off her flawless looks back in the early 1990s when she was an aspiring actress ready to embark on a Hollywood career. The Darling Buds of May star looked gorgeous as she posed in a photo shoot as she modelled various lingerie outfits over three decades ago, and the beauty has barely changed. Taking in 1991, the then 21-year-old smouldered in the glamourous shots as she sported bold makeup. In one photo, Catherine showedÂ her bare shoulders while wrapped in a blue gown, another picture saw the actress pose in a bodice as she leaned against a wall. A third snap showed the Legend of Zorro actress sitting on a leather chair as she put her long legs on display while wearing a pair of tights. More photos were released during the early half of the 90s with the actress unveiling her age-defying beauty.
