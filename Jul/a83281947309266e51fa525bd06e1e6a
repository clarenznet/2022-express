Leicester fan Katie Boulter was outfoxed by the French star who shocked Serena Williams in a painful Wimbledon defeat. The British wildcard had talked about causing a sensation like the 2016 Premier League winners after beating last year’s runner-up Karolina Pliskova in the second round.  But world No.118 Boulter failed to bring her big game to Court 2 yesterday against world No.115 Harmony Tan. The Frenchwoman won her first ever Wimbledon match in three hours against American legend Williams under the Centre Court roof late on Tuesday night. But starting at 11am today, Tan needed only 51 to beat the British No.3 6-1 6-1. Using a variety of slices, looped forehands and flat shots in a tricky wind, Boutler simply not no answers to the wily French star. At one point in the second set. BBC commentator John Lloyd said: “She just looks lost. She needs a sat-nav”.   Perhaps it was the early start or the emotion of reaching the third round following the death of her grandmother Hill, but this was not the Boulter of her first two matches. She was broken five times and did not even have a break point. Tan even won a crazy point to go 4-1 up in the second set after a tweener followed by a backhand pass. Boulter sent down a double fault on match point. Liam Broady, who plays No.19 seed Alex De Minaur, is now the only British player left in the singles. With Heather Watson and Cam Norrie already through to the fourth round, victory for Broady will see three British players through to the last 16 for the first time since 1997 when Virginia Wade, Mark Cox and Debbie Jevans won through.  After knocking out the home favourite, Tan said: "Yeah I think I like grass. I didn’t play on that court but I really like to play with some slice, volley, everything with my game so I’m really happy. "It was really emotional for the first round against Serena and after it was, you know, just play match by match and today was really good tennis. I don’t know why but it depends the day, you know?"
