Controversial tennis star Nick Kyrgios is in Wimbledon action again on Wednesday as he takes on Chilean Cristian Garin in a quarter-final clash on Court One. The 27-year-old beat American Brandon Nakashima in the last-16 earlier this week and will look to continue his quest for a first-ever grand slam title. And if he wins he could set up a mouthwatering semi-final with Spanish legend Rafael Nadal, who faces Taylor Fritz on Centre Court this afternoon. Kyrgios is a character who has always divided figures within the tennis world, but speaking ahead of their clash his opponent Garin insisted that he is good for the sport. "I think Nick is very good player. For me, maybe the best serve on tour," he said. "Yeah, I'm in quarter-finals, you know you will play the best players in the world. He is for me one of the guys that I like to watch. He's very good for tennis. "I think Nick has to be seeded because he for me is one of the best players on the tour and on grass obviously.Â I mean, the opportunities you have to build. If we are in this round, we both beat good players. "I don't see like an opportunity. I just want to enjoy, play my best, and fight every point as I always do." FOLLOW GARIN VS KYRGIOS LIVE BELOW
