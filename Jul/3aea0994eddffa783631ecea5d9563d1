Anne Hegerty stunned as she attended the National Reality TV Awards last night while posing for snaps with one hand on her hip. The Chase star, 64, dazzled as she donned a pretty floral number for the event at Porchester Hall. Anne, who's known as The Governess on the hit ITV show, looked glamorous in the pastel pink wrap dress which featured yellow and purple flowers. The star wore a full face of glam make-up which included a sultry, smokey eye. Anne accessorised with a pair of large gold earrings and a shimmering metallic clutch bag.
