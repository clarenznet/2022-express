It is the act of reading which, say researchers from Yale University, could help someone live longer. In a study published in the journal of Social Science and Medicine, they found readers lived longer than non-readers. Those who read for over three and a half hours a week lived around 23 months (just under two years) longer than people who didn’t read. Authors said the extended lifespan was regardless of “gender, wealth, education, or health [factors]”.

The reason for this was because previous studies hadn’t compared different types of reading material.  According to the researchers, book reading was more efficacious than general reading e.g., newspapers. The authors said this was because reading a book involves more cognitive faculties and provides “a survival advantage due to the immersive nature that helps maintain cognitive status”. There is no definitive conclusion on this at the moment. One theory is the mind is like a muscle, one that needs exercising and stretching in order to remain at its healthiest. Since reading exercises this muscle, it keeps it strong over a longer period of time. The stronger and healthier the brain is, the lower the risk of conditions such as dementia, one of the biggest killers in the UK. Around 67,000 people die every year from dementia, enough to fill a large football stadium. There is currently no cure for dementia, but scientists are working hard to change this.
