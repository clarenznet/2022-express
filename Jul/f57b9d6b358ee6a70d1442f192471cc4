Police rushed to reports of a man in significant pain at an address in Wandsworth, southwest London, at around 1.15am. Paramedics desperately tried to save his life but the man, who was in his 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene. An air ambulance was sent to the scene. Children at an adjacent nursery could this morning be heard singing as part of their graduation day. One woman, who is in her 50s, said: "It’s a weird house, I’ve never seen anyone coming in or out of there. You never get stuff like this around here, definitely not since I’ve been living here. Lots of families here as it’s a bit more out of the city. The police told me when I passed that we had nothing to worry about, so I don’t know what it’s about. I have no clue who lives there as it always looked quite empty." Metropolitan Police are trying to trace the man's next of kin, reports My London. Another resident said: "It’s a house of renters as far as I’m aware, people come and go. I’ve no idea who was there now, I think people rent rooms and then the kitchen etc are a communal facility. That’s not definite of course, just what I’ve heard. I didn’t hear anything last night, just came across the scene this morning whilst walking the dog." Officers arrested a man and a woman at the scene on suspicion of murder and they both remain in custody. A crime scene remains in place and anyone with information that may assist the investigation has been urged to call 101 or tweet @MetCC and quote CAD reference 349/27Jul. The investigation centres around a residential road in the Tooting Bec area of Wandsworth, just a few minutes from a London Underground station and the famous Tooting Bec Lido.
