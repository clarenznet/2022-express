Nick Kyrgios berated the chair umpire in his Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic, demanding a "drunk" woman to be kicked out for speaking during one of his service games. Tensions were always going to be high in Kyrgios' first ever Grand Slam final, but he got off to the better start by taking the opening set.  Djokovic soon found his rhythm in the match though to tie the scores with little separating the two in the third. Kyrgios appeared to be growing irate with his box during the set, shouting and calling them out. But it was one particular fan midway through the set that appeared to set Kyrgios off. While serving at 2-2 in the third, Kyrgios was clearly agitated and soon got a code violation from umpire Renaud Lichtenstein. That only annoyed Kyrgios further, who's frustration appeared to stem from a member of the crowd inside Centre Court. Kyrgios managed to hold serve in the end, but marched over to the chair umpire to moan about the woman in the crowd. “It shouldn’t be coming down to your opinion, it’s distracting me when I am serving in a Wimbledon final," he said. “There’s no other bigger occasion, you didn’t believe me and she did it again and it nearly cost me the game. “Why is she still here?! She is drunk out of her mind in the first row speaking to me in the middle of the game. What is acceptable? Keep her out. I know exactly which one it is, it’s the one who looks like she has had about 700 drinks bro.”  Kyrgios' fury continued at Lichtenstein as the Aussie approached the chair between each break of play. And former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli called for the umpire to punish the 27-year-old further. "This just has to stop. Kyrgios can't keep doing this - this is the final of Wimbledon," she said on BBC. "The umpire has to step and do something."
