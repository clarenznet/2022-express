The official news came this morning from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) who measured the core consumer prices index at 9.4 percent last month, up from May's rate of 9.1 percent. It's been largely driven by rising fuel prices, energy bills, food and mortgage costs Soaring inflation and rising prices are putting a real strain on household budgets, with pensioners one of the groups worst hit by the cost of living. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said: “Countries around the world are battling higher prices and I know how difficult that is for people right here in the UK, so we are working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation. “We’ve introduced £37billion worth of help for households, including at least £1,200 for eight million of the most vulnerable families and lifting over two million more of the lowest paid out of paying personal tax.”  While retirees tend to rely on a lower income or just the state pension to get by, even pensioners with savings will be struggling.

"This will be particularly key for those relying on cash savings, like retirees, as they will be seeing those savings lose real term value as inflation increases."

He said: “Another month and another rise in inflation as the relentless pressure on consumers continues." "This time the UK consumer prices index came in at 9.4 percent, a touch higher than forecasted as continued high energy and petrol prices take effect. "The Bank of England is expecting the peak around 11 percent, so there is some way yet to go and explains why a 50 basis points rise in interested rates is now firmly on the table at the Bank of England."

"Recession fears are growing by the day and if more extreme interest rate rises are required, this could easily tip the economy into contraction. "The financial pressure on consumers is only going to get more intense over the coming months and especially when we get the latest energy price cap later this year. "However, the BoE has to balance that with the need to get inflation down and given its persistence it may feel it has no choice but to act strongly now.” Further price rises could be on the cards as small businesses look likely to increase their prices this year. Alan Thomas, UK CEO at Simply Business said: “Half of all small business owners plan to increase their prices this year, while 48 percent are halting new hires and two in five are putting expansion plans on hold. "Yet it’s encouraging to see that SME confidence is improving as we emerge from the pandemic. "Indeed, the majority of owners are both confident and optimistic for the future of their business."
