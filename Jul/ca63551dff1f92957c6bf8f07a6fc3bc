Sharon Stone, 64, put her toned physique on display yesterday during a luxurious yacht trip in Sicily, Italy. The Basic Instinct actress slipped into a leopard print bikini and patterned blue and white trousers to soak up the sun during her outing on the ocean. In new pictures, she could be seen eating what appeared to be chips from a bowl as she took in the views onboard. She completed her chic look with some dark sunglasses and a pearl necklace, while keeping her stylishly cropped hair swept away from her face.
