Ms Rayner said Labour would table a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson's Government in the House of Commons "as early as next week" if the Tories do not remove him from Number 10 immediately. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, she said Mr Johnson “can’t stay another minute in Downing Street” and the Conservative Party should choose a successor “pretty quickly or get some interim leader in.” She added: "If they don’t do that we are very clear that we will put a motion of no confidence forward before the summer recess [July 21] to ensure that that exchange happens." Pushed on when a vote of no confidence could be held, Ms Rayner replied: “It could be as early as next week, yeah, because we haven’t got long left before the summer recess.” The Tory leadership contest could take months, which means Mr Johnson could stay in power until September or October.
