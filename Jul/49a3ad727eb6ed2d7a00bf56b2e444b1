The National Insurance starting threshold will rise from today, meaning many workers will start seeing more in their pay packets each month. Nearly 30 million working people will benefit from the tax reduction, with a typical employee saving hundreds of pounds this year with the change. The starting threshold from when you need to pay National Insurance will rise from £9,880 to £12,570 beginning on Wednesday. The change is temporary and was brought in as part of the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s cost of living measures as announced in the Spring Statement. It means employees and self-employed people will pay National Insurance contributions on less of their income or profits.

If you earn more than this, you will still feel the benefit and pay less national insurance overall due to the higher threshold. According to the Government, the average worker will save around £330 per year. The Government has said seven out of 10 workers who pay National Insurance will pay less than they did previously, even in spite of the 1.25 percentage point increase to NI made earlier this month. Analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown found someone earning £20,000 per year would currently have £104 of NI removed from their paycheck - but this will become £82 from July 6. A person paid £30,000 this year would have paid around £204 per month before April, then rising to £222 with the social care levy. But this will now fall to around £192 each month - a saving of £30.

But their payments will also fall by £30 to £303, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. But those on higher incomes will see their NI contributions increase. Those on £50,000 per year will see their payments rise from £4,851 to £4,959 each year, and those on £60,000 will see their payments increase by more than £200 a year, up to £5,311 from £5,078. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: “Any tax cut is welcome right now, especially one that eases the pain for lower earners. “They've faced the brunt of the rising cost of essentials because it makes up a bigger proportion of their spending, so they need all the help they can get. “However, we're not talking about vast sums of cash. £330 spread over 12 months is £27.50 a month. “It's a drop in the ocean compared to rising costs. So while it will help ease the pain slightly, those on lower incomes will still have a huge headache in making ends meet.”
