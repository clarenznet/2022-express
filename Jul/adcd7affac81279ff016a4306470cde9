The Department for Transport said 28 percent of male fatalities were unsecured, compared with 16 percent of females. Among those aged 17 to 29 the figure was as high as 32 percent.  Those killed between 8pm and 6am were more likely to be without a seat belt (39 percent). The RAC’s Rod Dennis called it“worrying”. He suggested a campaign to push seat belt use and questioned whether the £500 fines for not buckling up were a sufficient deterrent.
