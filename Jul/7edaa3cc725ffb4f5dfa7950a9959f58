David Beckham, 47, made an appearance at Wimbledon with his mum Sandra today - but no Victoria. The former footballer sat in the Royal Box as he watched the action at centre court. Photos showed his surprising new tattoo on his hand, which he has never shown fans before. It appears to be of a smiling stick person, holding something in their hand. The childlike nature of the drawing led some to speculate that it might have been created by one of his children. David looked dapper in a brown blazer with a white and blue striped shirt as he joined the Queen's grandson, Peter Phillips, and his new girlfriend, Lindsay Wallace.
