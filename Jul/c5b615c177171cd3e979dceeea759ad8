Yesterday’s vote saw Kemi Badenoch knocked out of the running to lead the Conservatives, and now only Mr Sunak, Ms Truss and Penny Mordaunt remain. Ms Mordaunt gained 10 votes to bring her total to 92, while Ms Truss gained 15 to boost her total to 86. Mr Sunak is still out in front with 118 votes. Even if Ms Mordaunt remains in second place, Ms Badenoch’s exit from the contest is excellent news for the Foreign Secretary as it could help her overtake Ms Mordaunt to go head-to-head with Mr Sunak for the premiership. As Ms Truss sits to the right of the party like the eliminated Ms Badenoch, she is in a stronger position to sweep up votes from her supporters, leaving Ms Mordaunt to fall behind. Tory MPs will vote later today for the final time. Results will be announced at 4pm. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
