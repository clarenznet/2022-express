Cat Deeley, 45, enjoyed some time to herself as she returned to LA recently to film So You Think You Can Dance? The presenter took to Instagram to share a string of sunkissed snaps as she posed in the tiny pink bikini. Cat showed off her gym-honed figure, as she posed looking longingly at the idyllic setting. She styled her blonde tresses in a light wave and covered her eyes with large black shades. Cat captioned the post in view of her 301,000 followers: "New York is always fun, but it’s lovely to be back, poolside, in sunny LA…. California vibes with @e11even_fragrance xxxx."
