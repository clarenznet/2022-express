Whether it is London, Birmingham, Manchester or, increasingly, market towns, this disease has spread exponentially. Understandably we mourn these losses but it is time to make it clear to the Government that empty promises are unacceptable. Until we have 24/7 local policing on our streets nothing will change. It worked in the distant past when the nation's crime figures were just a fraction of what they are today. It must return. So Frederick Forsyth writes the Covid-19 pandemic has been exaggerated, says Martin Game from Ipswich, Suffolk. The Chief Medical Officer for England stood at the Downing Street lectern and told us all that this virus was very dangerous. Why, in the face of worldwide evidence from China to Australia to America to Europe, does Mr Forsyth disagree?  It was so touching to see the response Sue Barker got from the crowd at Wimbledon at what is going to be her final year presenting the Championships, says Diane Silva from Bournemouth, Dorset. Sue, one of our finest players during the golden age of tennis in the 70s and early 80s, has always been charming, professional and much respected by peers and tennis fans alike. We shall really miss her. In James Whale's lead article about climate change he mentions Greta Thunberg and says that nobody voted for her, says Dave Lewis from Brotton, North Yorkshire. Yet on the same page he waxes lyrical about the monarchy while being very insulting about republicans. Well James, let me remind you nobody voted for the Royal Family either but you are quite happy to champion their cause. Lewis Hamilton's remarks after the Just Stop Oil protest at the British Grand Prix beggar belief, says John Howard from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He said: "I love that people are fighting for the planet and we need more people like them," while driving high octane fuelled cars and flying to destinations in a private jet.
