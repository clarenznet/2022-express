It is highly unlikely, given the nambypamby judicial system, that the evil trio will remain behind bars for life. The mother and father have a good chance of being released by parole board panels after just 30-odd years and the stepbrother after 15 years or less. It will cost taxpayers around Â£50,000 a year to keep each of the evil trio in prison - in better conditions than those experienced by hundreds of thousands of senior citizens and lower income families. While not wishing to detract from the wonderful work that Dame Deborah James has done, I must mention that seven years ago my wife was diagnosed with bowel cancer and she had taken the "poo" test which proved negative, says John Brown from Aughton, Lancashire. I am saying this because the test is only looking for blood, but my wife had a 2.5-inch tumour with no sign of blood. Fortunately she survived to tell the tale. Halifax bank needs to be reminded that this country is a democracy, and bowing to the will of the woke minority is wrong, says Bill Biggins from Cawood, North Yorkshire. If the non-woke customers of the Halifax all did as suggested and closed their accounts down, I have no doubt the company would be in serious financial trouble. Once Tesco have taken delivery of the goods why should Heinz feel they can dictate the price at which they should be sold? asks Jean Harker from Sidcup, Kent. If Tesco want to help in this financial climate, that is great. Otherwise, Heinz may find its fans are unable to stay loyal to their brand.  With the Rwanda flights on the back-burner we need another way to prevent illegal migrants crossing the Channel, says Dick Bedford from Cullompton, Devon. We have given the French millions to stop the crossings but they do not want these people draining their economy. I suggest that for every migrant that arrives on our shores from France we remove the licence for a French boat to fish in our waters.
