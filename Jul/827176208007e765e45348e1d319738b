The famous photograph of Kim Phuc Phan Thi running in agony, severely burned and naked, from US incendiary bombs was used on newspaper front pages all over the world. The Pulitzer Prize-winning picture by photographer Nick Ut overnight became a defining image of the Vietnam war. Kim, 59, said: "I'm no longer a victim of war... I'm a friend, I'm a helper. I'm a grandmother and now I'm a survivor calling out for peace."  Her final operation was done without charge by Miami doctor Jill Waibel, and Kim - who moved to Canada 30 years ago - said she does not need more treatment. Nick, 71, saved her life in 1972 near her home in Trang Bang by insisting medics treat her when they said she would die. They remain friends.
