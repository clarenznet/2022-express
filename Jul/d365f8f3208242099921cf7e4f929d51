The "risk" of President Alexander Lukashenko, a long-time Kremlin ally, getting formally involved in the military conflict will "grow in proportion" to Putin's successes in Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba said. According to Amnesty International, which exposed and condemned the jailing of people in Belarus who spoke out against Moscow's war, "the Belarusian authorities are increasingly clamping down on all dissent and continuing to support Russia in its aggression against Ukraine". However, although "Russia is already using Belarusian territory", a full-scale attack is not imminent, Mr Kuleba thinks. He said: "As long as the Belarusian army clearly understands that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are capable of seriously slamming them, they will postpone their action in every possible way. As of now, they are clearly aware of this." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE WAR IN UKRAINE
