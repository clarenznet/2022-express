David Hasselhoff marked his 70th birthday surrounded by his Baywatch co-stars at a big party on Sunday. Kelly Packard, David Chokachi, Jeremy Jackson and Parker Stevenson all joined David to ring in his big day. The gang haven’t changed a day from their 1990s heyday. Kelly, 47, looked stunning in a khaki jumpsuit and penned in her Instagram caption: “Happy birthday to the man, the myth, the legend! “One of my hero’s turned 70 today! You will never meet a more generous, kind, talented man! I am so happy we could celebrate with you!! And as always good to see all my cast mates and friends.”
