 Video footage shared online has captured the moment two boats came into contact close to the Erasmus Bridge.  The smallest of these, reportedly a water taxi, is understood to have capsized.  The other – what appears to be a tour boat – appeared to remain largely undamaged.  There are as yet no reports on casualties.  More to follow.
