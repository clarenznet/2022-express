Britney Spears, 40, was overjoyed at the weekend when she met Kingsman star, Taron Egerton. Despite being one of the biggest stars in pop music, Britney could not help but gush over the actor being the “coolest guy ever”. She took to Instagram to share a series of posts alongside Taron, who could be seen wearing a stylish beige and white outfit as he wrapped an arm around the singer. Britney donned a matching beige blazer and aviator sunglasses as she captioned one of the shots: “Coolest guy ever !!! Such a freaking fan … I was so s****d !!!”(sic)
