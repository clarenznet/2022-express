A Met Police spokesperson said: "Police were called at 11.31pm on Wednesday, July 13 to concerns for the welfare of a woman at a hotel in Addington Street, SE1. "Officers attended along with the London Ambulance Service and the woman, aged in her 40s, was seen to fall from a window. “She died at the scene. "Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by officers."

Addington Street, near to the Southbank, where the incident took place, was closed at around 12pm last night. Addington Street in Central London sits just back from the River Thames, between Westminster Bridge and the Southbank and Waterloo Station. TfL traffic camera footage at the scene showed the short road was cordoned off at each end. At 7.22am the street was reopened after officers lifted their cordon.
