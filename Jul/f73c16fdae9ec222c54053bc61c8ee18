Carol Vorderman, 61, put her chic sense of style on display today as she made an appearance at the 2022 Air Tattoo. During her visit to the military air show, the former Countdown star met General Charlie Duke, the youngest human to walk on the Moon. In pictures shared with Carol’s 231,000 Instagram followers, the TV star could be seen wearing a puff-sleeved orange maxi dress. Carol accessorised the gown with a brown belt worn accentuating her slim waistline and a pair of matching lace-up heeled boots.
