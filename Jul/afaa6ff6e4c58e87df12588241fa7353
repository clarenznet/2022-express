Gary Oldman and his wife looked more in love than ever as they attended the Giffoni Film Festival in Italy. The Harry Potter actor, 64, couldn't keep his hands off wife Gisele Schmidt, 60, as he pulled her in for an embrace on the red carpet. Gisele and Gary were all smiles as they posed for snaps while going in for a kiss. The Sirius Black actor opted for a smart casual look in beige linen trousers and a relaxed white shirt which he paired with matching Converse. Meanwhile, Giselle stunned in an elegant, v-neck black dress and wore her tresses up in a bun away from her face.
