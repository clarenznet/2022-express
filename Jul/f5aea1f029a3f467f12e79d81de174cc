David Beckham, 47, looked dapper in a brown suit jacket today as he attended Wimbledon Day 10 with his mother Sandra. He sported white chino trousers, a white handkerchief, and a coordinating tie. However, the former professional footballer looked slightly distracted, as he watched the match looking deep in thought with a gloomy expression. It comes as Manchester United legend David has just celebrated his 23rd wedding anniversary with his beloved wife Victoria. The couple took to their Instagram accounts to share their love for each other while marking the milestone earlier this week.
