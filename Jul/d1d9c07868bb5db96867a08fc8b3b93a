The European Research Group (ERG) is reportedly applying pressure for Liz Truss to join forces with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch's campaigns. The reports come amid swelling concern that the three Brexiteers are splitting support on the right, giving former Chancellor Mr Sunak and Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt a clear path to the final two. Telegraph Associate Editor Christopher Hope said: "Wow! I am picking up pressure tonight from ERG sources for Suella Braverman, Liz Truss and Kemi Badenoch to merge campaigns and blow Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt out of the water." Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawi crashed out of the contest on Wednesday, leaving six candidates in the race to become the next Prime Minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, commanded the support of the most Tory MPs, receiving 88 votes, with Penny Mordaunt - who earlier polling showed has become a favourite among grassroots activists - taking second place on 67. Also still in the race is Ms Truss, Ms Braverman, Ms Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
