Brad Pitt, 58, looked like he was having fun last night as he attended the Paris premiere for his film Bullet Train. The actor could be seen in red carpet pictures kicking his leg up in the air and getting close to the cameras. He looked youthful in an oversized grey suit, which he paired with a V-neck light blue t-shirt. The Fight Club star completed the casual look with some dark sunglasses and white trainers.
