Scotland's First Minister wondered if this could be one of Boris Johnson's "last acts as PM". Ms Sturgeon claimed that the referendum will go forward regardless the UK Government's stance against it. She also repeated the projected date that the referendum could take place - October 19, 2023. And Ms Sturgeon claimed that Scotland will not be a "prisoner" of the PM. In a post on Twitter, she said: "Just received this from Johnson (one of his last acts as PM?). To be clear, Scotland will have the opportunity to choose independence - I hope in a referendum on 19 October 2023 but, if not, through a general election. Scottish democracy will not be a prisoner of this or any PM."    More to follow...
