Oliver Mailey, 26, appeared at Blackburn Magistrates Court over the murder of Abel-Jax Mailey. On November 28 last year, officers from Lancashire Constabulary were called to an address in Burnley at around 12.10pm by the ambulance service who first arrived at the scene.  Abel-Jax was found unresponsive at the scene. He was taken to hospital before being transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital for further treatment but tragically died two days later on November 30. A post-mortem organised by the Home Office concluded he had died of a head injury. A man and woman were both initially arrested on suspicion of murder but the woman was later released with no charges.
