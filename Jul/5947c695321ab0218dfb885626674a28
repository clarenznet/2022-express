The composer, lyricist and singer was a West End musicals veteran when he was asked to score Dr No in 1962. Bond producer Cubby Broccoli, who had acquired the rights to Ian Fleming's books with Harry Saltzman, had liked Norman's music in the show Belle or the Ballad of Dr Crippen and convinced him to take on the job. He resurrected old song, Bad Sign, Good Sign, from a disused stage production of V.S. Naipaul's A House For Mr Biswas and switched the sitar riff to an electric guitar to drop the "Indian feel". Instantly, he had a hit. "His sexiness, his mystery, his ruthlessness - it's all there in a few notes," he said. He also wrote Dr No's Underneath The Mango Tree, sung by his then wife Diana Coupland. He was born Monty Noserovitch in Stepney, east London, to Latvianborn cabinetmaker Abraham Noserovitch and his wife, Annie (née Berlin), a seamstress. Evacuated during the Second World War, he returned during the Blitz.  His mother bought him a guitar when he was 16 and he took lessons with guitar virtuoso Bert Weedon. After completing his national service in the RAF, he sung in London variety shows with Benny Hill, Tommy Cooper and Tony Hancock before he moved into songwriting. Irma La Douce and Expresso Bongo, his first two musicals, were triumphs. He also wrote music for The Two Faces Of Dr Jekyll, Call Me Bwana and Dickens Of London in the 1960s. He died after a short illness. Monty Norman, born April 4, 1928 – died July 11, 2022, aged 94
