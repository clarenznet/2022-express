The lucky winner would instantly become richer than singers Harry Styles, who is worth an estimated £100million, and Adele, worth around £150million.  Andy Carter, of the National Lottery, said: “These jackpots not only transform the lives of the winners, but also enable them to support friends, family and communities.” Joe and Jess Thwaite, from Gloucester, scooped a £184million EuroMillions jackpot less than two months ago.
