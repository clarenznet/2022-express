David Beckham, 47, has issued a touching message to the England Women’s football team after their incredible victory last night. He thanked the Lionesses for “inspiring” his daughter Harper, 11. While Harper’s father might be one of the most celebrated footballers in the country, it’s the Lionesses who are her true inspiration, David revealed. He thanked the players for lifting the spirits of the country ahead of their 4-0 victory over Sweden, which landed them a place in the final of the Women’s Euros. Taking to Instagram in view of his 74.8million followers, David wished the team good luck. “Hey, Lionesses, it’s David here. I just wanted to send you a message, firstly to say congratulations on an incredible tournament so far,” he said.
