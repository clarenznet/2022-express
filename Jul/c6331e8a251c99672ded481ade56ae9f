Ferguson, also known as “Fergie”, published her first young adult novel last month. But in the past, one of the former Princess’ main escapes from life wasn’t writing – it was binge eating. During the pandemic, Fergie shared how she found “consolation” from family issues in sausages and egg mayonnaise sandwiches. “After my parents divorced when I was 12, I blamed myself, thinking I was somehow responsible,” penned Ferguson in The Sun. “I started comfort eating at boarding school and I’d pile on the pounds, only to take great pains to lose them — then I would put them on again. “It was a pattern that continued into my adult life.” Although she said she has “never been better” in terms of binge eating, in more recent media appearances, the star has admitted to having to work hard on her mental health.

Because of her experience, Fergie has since weighed in on the high levels of obesity in the country and backed the Government’s obesity strategy back in 2020. “Personal responsibility for excess weight is often cited as the answer,” she said. “However, obesity levels in the UK will not reduce without us addressing a range of factors which contribute to the unhealthy society in which we live.”
