  Katie was caught smiling and laughing during a video call on the streets of Soho, New York City. The star looked casual but chic in some baggy, mint coloured denim overalls. She completed the look with some tan sandals and a white tote bag with a red strap. Katie and Bobby first made their first appearance as a couple in April 2022.
