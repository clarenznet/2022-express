  Speaking on her Instagram story, Gemma gushed: “Shoot day! We’re at a gorgeous house shooting the swimwear for In The Style. Hope you guys like it!” The radio presenter then posed in a number of flattering bikinis, including one with a sporty black cut, which she paired with a monochrome set. She also modelled a plunging orange triangle bikini, as well as a stunning mint green number. Gemma’s favourite outfit of the day was a black one piece with a white trim and flattering scoop neckline, which she paired with a monochrome sarong tied loosely around her waist.
