The Competition and Markets Authority said it would take action if the firms were found to have made misleading claims. Officials said they would look into ­ Asos’s Responsible Edit range, Boohoo’s Ready for the Future items and the George for Good collection. The CMA’s move comes after allegations that some retailers are “greenwashing” – ­making themselves appear to be interested in ­protecting the environment when they are not. It could result in them being taken to court if it emerges their claims do not “stack up.” Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s interim chief executive, said: “People who want to buy green should be able to do so confident that they aren’t being misled." “Eco-friendly and sustainable products ­­can play a role in tackling climate change, but only if they are genuine." “We’ll be scrutinising green claims from Asos, Boohoo and George at Asda to see if they stack up. Should we find these companies are using misleading eco claims, we won’t ­hesitate to take enforcement action – through the courts if necessary.” Asos and Boohoo said yesterday that ­they would co-operate with the CMA’s investigation. Asda said in a statement: “We are ready and willing to answer any questions the CMA ­have about our George for Good range and welcome further work by the CMA to ensure the sustainability claims made by the fashion industry as a whole are robust and clear.” This is “just the start” of the CMA’s work ­in this sector, Ms Cardell said, adding that fashion companies should make sure they comply with the law.
