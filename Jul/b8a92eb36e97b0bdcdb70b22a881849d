Victoria Beckham's daughter Harper, 11, seemed keen to prove that she matched her fashion entrepreneur mum in the style stakes when she donned exactly the same outfit for a series of mirror selfies. "I donâ€™t know where she gets it from!" Mum-of-four Victoria jokingly exclaimed of her only daughter as she shared a snap of herself in the same clothing. The item that had been captivating both Spice Girl turned high fashion icon Victoria and her youngest child Harper was a black Versace outfit featuring a gold rococo style print all over it. Harper let her long blonde tresses cascade loosely around her as she held her phone up in the mirror to capture her latest dress-up session. Meanwhile fans answered Victoria's rhetorical question by assuring her: "She got it from her mama!"
