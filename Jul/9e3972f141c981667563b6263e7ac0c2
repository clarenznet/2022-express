Robbie Williams, 48, made a stellar appearance last night during Paris Fashion Week as he made a bold fashion statement. The Angels singer was joined by his wife Ayda Field, who he shared a kiss with as they walked the red carpet. Robbie opted for a floor-length black cloak that covered his body almost entirely, only showing small parts of the white t-shirt he wore underneath. Ayda looked fabulous in an elegant off-the-shoulder corset top and wide leg matching trousers, which were accessorised with a black ribbon cinching her waist.
