Phillip Schofield, 60, has had an ongoing battle with "eye floaters", first opening up about the debilitating condition last October. The This Morning host took to Instagram and Twitter today to share pictures after having surgery performed to “suck the jelly out” of his eye. Despite the hot weather, Phillip has not let his health woes get in the way of his sunbathing time as he posted an update on Instagram. He was glowing as he added a parrot and pirate emoji to the picture in view of his three million followers. The ITV star captioned the snap: "Factor 50 on half of my face or the patch mark will last for days."
