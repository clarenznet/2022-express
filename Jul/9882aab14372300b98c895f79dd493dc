Louise Redknapp, 47, showed off her sunkissed tan as she holidayed in Mykonos. The star stripped off to a black bandeau bikini and soaked up the glorious sunshine. Going makeup-free, Louise shared snaps of her sunbathing on a beach before enjoying a boozy lunch. The star shared a glimpse of her stunning resort, with mountain views near an outdoor pool. Louise was joined by her two sons, Charley, 17, and 13-year-old Beau, who she shares with ex-husband Jamie Redknapp. They looked in high spirits as they played football on the beach and tucked into platters of food. Alongside the holiday snaps, Louise wrote: "Had the best time with my boys and our friends on our summer holiday… until next time Mykonos."
