The Labour leader, who campaigned for a second referendum, gave a major speech insisting he wants to "make Brexit work". But he faced an immediate backlash from his own MPs, while Brexiteers said they did not trust his "conversion".  Conservative Brexiteer Peter Bone said: "Why has he completely changed his position on Brexit? And most of his party are Remainers. "This is a cynical attempt to win votes." In a speech at the Irish Embassy, Sir Keir said Labour is "claiming the centre ground of British politics once again".   He went on: "We cannot afford to look back over our shoulder, because all the time we are doing that we are missing what is ahead of us. "So let me be very clear. Under Labour, Britain will not go back into the EU. We will not be joining the single market. We will not be joining a customs union." Labour's Rosie Duffield said: "If an MP was elected with an anti-Brexit mandate, they should continue to speak up against it."
