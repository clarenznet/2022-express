She has not made a film since 2014, when she played Miss Hannigan in Annie alongside Jamie Foxx. But the There's Something About Mary actress will be alongside Jamie again for the new comedy from Netflix. Foxx announced the news on Twitter after sharing a recording of a phone between the pair. In it, he loops Cameron in with American football star Tom Brady, who gave her tips on "un-retiring" after he briefly quit. Cameron, 49, said: "I feel excited." In 2021, she revealed she was stepping back from her film career as it prevented her from "managing other parts of her life." She said: "When you're the person on the screen, all parts of you that isn't that have to be handed off to other people."
