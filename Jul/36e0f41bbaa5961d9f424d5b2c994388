Ashes weighing 17.5 tons were uncovered near the Soldau concentration camp in what is now north-east Poland. Tomasz Jankowski, at Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, said the victims were mostly Polish elites who "were probably assassinated around 1939" before burial. In 1944 the Nazis ordered Jewish prisoners to exhume remains and burn them to hide the crime, said the INR. Archaeologists found remnants of clothing but nothing of value, which suggests the bodies were robbed before being set alight. Samples are to be DNA tested to identify some victims. Philip Blood, a war historian, said efforts to keep killings secret "were extensive and inept", adding: "Eight thousand is large but sadly not the largest."
