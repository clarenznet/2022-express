Christy Turlington, 53, found fame as a Calvin Klein model and has proved that she still has her supermodel shape. The flexible star was seen performing a difficult yoga move while flashing her incredibly toned stomach. In another snap, she wore a black tank top, displaying her sculpted arms and slim waist. The wife of filmmaker Ed Burns looked radiant in the photo shoot as she modeled exercise clothing. Christy was advertising a new campaign on Instagram with Athleta as she posed with members of her family including her mother.
