    Geri seemed to be having a fabulous time in her garden, as she could be seen selecting some bright yellow flowers to create a colourful, decorative basket. The singer wore a tan colour matching co-ord with an intricate woven design. The garment featured a high neckline, short skirt and left the star’s midriff exposed. ‘Ginger Spice’ wore a floppy straw hat atop her red locks and finished the look with some pale blue trainers. Some fans noticed Geri wasn’t wearing white - a colour she often champions for her outfits. Chantell wrote: “I was so surprised! You’re not wearing white! Hehehe my husband and I follow F1 and we always see you in white.” (sic) Kevin added: “You’re not wearing white? Enjoy the day!”
