But what captures my imagination is not the crises themselves, but the way that our country - under the right leader - faces them down and ultimately becomes stronger. When we have a leader who puts the British values first, who believes that the state should be a servant, who wants to keep taxes low and spend responsibly, who is a conviction politician who is not guided by the media but instead by the national interest, then I believe that there is no challenge we cannot overcome.Having watched her both in government and in this leadership race, I have no hesitation in saying that Penny Mordaunt is that leader. As a former Defence Secretary and a serving member of our Armed Forces, Penny lives and breathes public service in a way that the British people are frankly crying out for. Not only that, but her ability to go into battle on behalf of our values and ideals as a Party are second-to-none. Labour and the Liberal Democrats fear her so much because she embodies the things they pretend or aspire to be: devoted, principled and patriotic.But it is not just values that Penny won me over with, it is her specific plans for our country. I have said for some time that we need to target tax cuts where they will have the most impact for the greatest number of people and not forget the squeezed middle. So when Penny announced that she would cut fuel duty by 50 per cent and increase income tax thresholds for basic and middle income earners in line with inflation, I knew she shared my vision for growth and low tax policies. As a former education minister who attended cabinet for ten months, I recognise the value that education and skills opportunities have for communities and the economy. One thing that our next leader must do is embrace the power of education as an engine of social mobility in the same way Margaret Thatcher did.
