I also grew up with the understanding that nothing was impossible. Under Margaret Thatcher, the Britain I knew was full of boundless optimism and opportunity. That has been lost and a change is needed. My aim is a simple one: to provide the opportunities that were afforded to my generation to all Britons. Thanks to Brexit, we are now a free nation. Let’s not just talk about the opportunities that follow, let’s take them. If a young boy, who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next prime minister, anything is possible. I will be putting forward to my colleagues and our members a new vision for our party and our country with the following pledges: 1. The burden of tax is simply too high. As an entrepreneur and businessman, I know that lower taxes are how we create a thriving and dynamic economy. 2. Having been born in Iraq and fled the dangers of Saddam, I know security, safety and freedom are things we can never take for granted. That’s why defence spending needs to rise in response to the barbarism of Putin’s war in Ukraine. 3. I will continue my education reforms that are improving schools across the country. I will also continue to focus on letting children be children, protecting them from damaging and inappropriate nonsense being forced on them by radical activists. Combined, this will begin the journey towards hope. A more prosperous nation, one which can provide the best opportunities to its next generation. A nation where your only ceiling is yourself. The only thing that can hold you back is the limits of your imagination.
