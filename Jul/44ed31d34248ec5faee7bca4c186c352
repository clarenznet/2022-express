Former Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke showcased her elegant sense of style as she smiled brightly on stage at the opening of The Seagull at The Playhouse Theatre in London on Thursday. The actress, 35, wore a sand-hued knitted co-ord, consisting of an oversized crop top and a high-waisted skirt. Her sleeveless top put her slender arms on show as she confidently posed with her hand on her hip. Emilia looked very toned as she wore a pair of pointed white high-heeled shoes which added a few inches to her stature. The star, who plays the role of Nina in the production, wore her hair pinned back with strands styled into loose waves at the front, and she opted for lashings of make-up to highlight her pretty features. She was joined at the photocall by fellow cast member Daniel Monks, who plays Konstantin in Anton Chekhov's play.
