  “Phone memories,” Gorka captioned the cute Instagram snaps with two heart eyes emojis. The dancer’s throwback pics showed Gemma posing in the sea with wet hair and wearing a black bikini top with tropical-print bottoms, while carrying a snorkelling mask. Another snap showed the former Emmerdale star holding their toddler Mia, who wore a cute red striped dress with a light pink cardigan. Gorka could be seen posing with a skateboard with his hand in another photo, flexing a bicep as he posed in shades and a white T-shirt.
