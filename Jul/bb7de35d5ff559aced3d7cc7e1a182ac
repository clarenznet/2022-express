The Competition and Markets Authority said it has launched an investigation into what it believes is the "anti-competitive" actions of the broadcasters, as well as sports agency IMG's Premier League Productions business. It produces content for TV groups that show topflight English football. The watchdog is investigating the four under section 25 of the Competition Act 1998, which allows it to look into potential cartels. The CMA said: "At this stage we believe we have reasonable grounds to suspect one or more breaches of competition law." Sky and IMG said there were co-operating with the probe, while BT said: "We note today's statement from the CMA and are reviewing the details while cooperating fully with their team." An ITV spokesman said: "ITV is committed to complying with competition law and is cooperating with the CMA's inquiries. ITV does not propose to comment further at this stage."
