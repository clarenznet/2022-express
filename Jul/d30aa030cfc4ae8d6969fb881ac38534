Manchester United are in talks to sign Leandro Paredes from Paris Saint-Germain in a shock transfer swoop for the midfielder, according to reports. The Argentina international is expected to depart the Parc des Princes this summer following the departure of Mauricio Pochettino and initially, a return to Italy looked to be on the cards. However, it now seems like United are keen on exploring a move for the 28-year-old, who has been capped 44 times by his country. Paredes is expected to make Argentina's World Cup squad but a new challenge in the Premier League could now await him before Qatar. According to Sky Italia journalist Angelo Mangiante, talks are 'ongoing' between United and PSG over a deal as Erik ten Hag looks to up the ante in pursuit of new additions. Mangiante tweeted: "Manchester United are interested in Leo Paredes. Talks ongoing."

Talks remain ongoing for Frenkie de Jong but Barcelona are continuing to hold firm and they are expected to keep the Dutchman barring any dramatic changes. Paredes is seemingly one of the alternative names under consideration and he could fit into one of Ten Hag's box-to-box roles. United need to add at least two new central midfielders after already losing Nemanja Matic (Roma) and Paul Pogba (Juventus) on free transfers. Scott McTominay will be staying put while Fred will also be looking to provide further competition in the engine room. James Garner could also stay at Old Trafford as he gets the chance to impress his new manager in pre-season following his excellent stint with Nottingham Forest.
