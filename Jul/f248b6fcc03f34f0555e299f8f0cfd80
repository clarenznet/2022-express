  Kimberley Walsh, 40, has opened up about her friendship with Pasha Kovalev, 42, following their former partnership on BBC One’s Strictly Come Dancing in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. The Girls Aloud star spoke about her relationship with Pasha and his wife Rachel Riley, 36, as she detailed her team up with household name Wickes, which is launching an exciting programme that will see one lucky community win a prize of £10,000.      Kimberely and Pasha competed together in the tenth series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012. The Morning Live star became joint runner-up in the final alongside Denise van Outen and lost out to Louis Smith. Asked who she still keeps in touch with from the show, Kimberley immediately confirmed that her friendship with Pasha is still strong. “I do keep in touch with Pasha,” she said. “Obviously, he was my partner and we got on really well.     “He's such a lovely guy. I tend to try and go and watch him in the theatre, actually, when I can wherever he's touring and stuff.” Quizzed on whether she has also made friends with Pasha’s wife Rachel, who presents Channel 4’s Countdown, Kimberely provided some further insight. “I've met Rachel a few times with him but mainly, obviously it tends to be that I'll go and support him at a show that he's doing or he'll come and watch me in something that I'm doing,” she explained. “We keep saying that we'll get all the kids together, but it's not really happened yet. Life is so busy.       “We haven’t managed it yet and also his kids are quite young and I’ve just had a baby as well. “So, life does get in the way a bit doesn't it? But no, he's a lovely guy,” she concluded. Kimberely shares three young sons with her husband Justin Scott, 38. The couple welcomed baby Nate last year, while his older brothers’ names are Bobby, seven, and Cole, five. READ MORE...

Kimberely also talked about how she feels about Strictly, ten years on from competing on the show. “Even though I was part of the show and a runner up, I actually still feel like a fan,” she reflected.     “I still feel like I've just gone back to being a general punter that just loves watching the show, and I've managed to get the kids into it now so they like watching it with me too!” Apart from reminiscing about her time on Strictly, Kimberley was also keen to speak about the Wickes Community Programme, which she believes will help transform a community in need. The DIY enthusiast has teamed up with home improvement retailer Wickes to launch the competition, which gives one community organisation the chance to win £10,000. Wickes have launched the initiative after research has revealed half of Brits claim a renewed Community Space would improve their mental health and wellbeing.
