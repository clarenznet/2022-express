Morrison was born in Florida in 1943. As his father served in the Navy and would go on to become an admiral, his childhood saw him move around America. Jim was a voracious reader and studied at UCLA, making several short films while living in LA's Venice Beach after graduating.  In 1965 he and Ray Manzarek, a fellow UCLA student, formed The Doors, named after Aldous Huxley's book The Doors Of Perception on his psychedelic experiences with mescaline. They were later joined by guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. The following year they were performing in the famous Whisky a Go Go venue and recorded Break On Through (To the Other Side). In 1967 they signed with Elektra and hit the big time. Light My Fire spent three weeks at number one and they were one of the most popular bands in the country. But Morrison's behaviour began to deteriorate. He was showing up for recording sessions and gigs either drunk or on drugs. He also got in trouble for shouting obscenities at the audience. In March 1971, after recording LA Woman, he decided to spend time in Paris with his bandmates' blessing. Within months he was dead. French law did not require an autopsy but there are rumours he died of a heroin overdose. He is one of a number of singers - including Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix - who died aged 27. Another, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, died at the same age two years earlier to the day as Morrison. The Doors icon is buried at Paris's famous Père Lachaise Cemetery, where fans still leave tributes to him to this day.  1890: Idaho becomes the 43rd US state. 1927: Film director Ken Russell is born. 1996: John Major announces that the Stone of Scone will be returned to Scotland.
