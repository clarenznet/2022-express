Britons have been left queuing for hours after a "critical incident" was declared at the Port of Dover. The port’s chief executive blamed “woefully inadequate” staffing at French border control for the long queues. He added that the port had been "badly let down" by France. French authorities said an "unforeseeable technical incident" in the Channel Tunnel meant French border police were delayed into Dover. Ms Truss will shortly be speaking with the French foreign minister as the chaos unfolds. Thankfully for British tourists, the port has announced that "traffic is slowly beginning to move", as the French border control ramp up their resources. It has warned however that it would "take some time to clear the backlog". Dover's MP Natalie Elphicke claimed French border officers "didn't turn up for work". But in a statement this afternoon prefect for the Haut-de-France region Georges-Francois Leclerc said the claims that French border control had failed to mobilise sufficient staff for the holiday rush are inaccurate. The statement said: "The increase in traffic for this weekend was fully anticipated and a suitable deployment was prepared. "The plan was to have all the police booths manned at Dover by 08:30 BST. "An unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour."
