Demi Moore has taken to Instagram to display her ageless beauty in a series of stunning swimwear snaps. The Charlie's Angels star, 59, was modelling pieces from her collaboration with Andie Swim in view of her 2.9million followers. One snap sees Demi in a black two-piece which perfectly hugs her incredible curves. The actress displayed a hint of sideboob, before giving fans a generous view in a plunging v-neck swimsuit as she lay back in a crystal-clear pool. In another, Demi displayed her pert rear as she leant over a balcony while throwing a smile over her shoulder. She captioned the set of snaps: "Second drop is here! All styles in my collab with @andieswim are available to shop now," followed by a red heart.
