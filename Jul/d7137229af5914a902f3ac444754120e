The Kirkfield Hotel, in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, previously implemented a policy of "no shorts". However, this came under harsh scrutiny from the public amid the recent heatwave, with punters taking to social media to brand the dress code as "ridiculous". A post in a Facebook community group lamenting the policy received more than 180 likes, and hundreds of comments, the Liverpool Echo reports. One user commented on the post: "I was turned away on a hot evening for wearing shorts, I think it's a ridiculous rule." Another said: "We went as a family at tea time a few weeks ago. Was told by the doorman we couldn’t go in the main lounge and would have to eat in the bar as my 67-year-old husband had shorts on. We obliged but then the same doorman let a young girl and her boyfriend into the other side because they complained. We never said anything as it must’ve been difficult for the doormen to implement this crazy rule." In a statement, The Kirkfield management said: "They say there is no such thing as bad press… this weekend and for a few weeks now there has been a healthy debate about our dress code policy. "Facebook and social media can be very powerful and helpful but some comments made which are rude about us and our team really don’t factor in this debate but we appreciate we aren’t for everyone. That’s the point of having a variety of establishments on our high street, so that there is choice for all. "Hospitality is a challenging business and many restaurants and bars have a no short policy. However, we have received varying feedback and we have listened. From today our policy on no shorts will be removed.  "We will however still stick with our policy of no sportswear or caps in the restaurant or main bar on Friday and Saturday evenings. Sportswear is fine in the pub, lounge and gardens at any time. We have not meant to offend anyone with this policy."
