Drew Barrymore looked elated as she watched the Dolce & Gabbana haute couture fall/winter 22/23 show at Castello Maniace in Sicily yesterday. The Charlie's Angel star, 47, was all smiles as she attended the prestigious fashion show on Monday in a stunning outfit. Appearing in high spirits, Drew donned a full-bodied, peachy coloured tulle gown which skimmed the ground as she walked. The mother of two wore a floral headpiece in the same hue and a black, long-sleeved top. Drew had her flame-haired curls thrown over her shoulders and wore lashing of lipstick to watch the show in.
