Food price hikes have left many desperate in 2022, as inflation surges to nine percent and wages stutter in the face of a cost of living crisis. Supermarket customers were recently shocked to find a kilogram pack of Lurpak worth £9.35 on Iceland's website, with a second 750g tub for £7.25 on Sainsbury's. Efforts to find blame for the dizzyingly high prices have settled on several factors, ranging from Brexit-prompted worker shortages to the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Sainsbury's pledged it was doing what it can to "mitigate rising costs", while Lurpak maker Arla Food said prices had to rise so farmers could "continue supplying".
