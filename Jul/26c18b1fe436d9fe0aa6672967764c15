But 39 percent of those admitted they have given up on the idea of returning – as it’s less embarrassing and cheaper to do treatments at home. And more than a quarter (28 percent) say they love not having to book themselves an appointment in order to pamper themselves. It also emerged that those who have switched to at-home hair removal methods reckon they have saved an average of £160. Olivia Hughes, from Braun, which commissioned the research as part of its Salon to Sofa campaign, said: “A lot has changed in the choices we're making when it comes to our beauty routines today. “Convenience has become an even more important deciding factor for women, alongside reliable results.” It also emerged 62 percent of women prefer to do their hair removal at home – with legs and the bikini line among the areas they are comfortable taking on themselves. And home treatments last between two to four weeks until hair grows back. Taking on beauty treatments at home has been driven by cost, with nearly two-thirds (63 percent) doing so because it’s cheaper, according to the OnePoll data. Meanwhile one in four (24 percent) say they don’t enjoy the exposing experiences hair removal can bring in a salon, and prefer to do it where they feel more comfortable. Dr Anjali Mahto, author of The Skincare Bible and ambassador for the brand, said: “The reality is that no method of hair removal is permanent, whether from home or the salon. “Now we’ve dispelled that myth, it’s clear to see the appeal of choosing a long-term hair removal solution that works, which you can manage from the comfort of your own home and on your own terms. “Gone are the days when only salon treatments worked – today, technology is so advanced, that there are products on the market which offer great, effective results at home.”
