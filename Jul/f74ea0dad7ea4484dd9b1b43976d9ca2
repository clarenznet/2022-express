The Prime Minister meets with the Queen each Wednesday to brief her on the latest developments. But this week’s meeting is understood to be of particular significance as the Government is challenged after Mr Johnson faces multiple calls for resignation. The monarch was spotted on her way back to Windsor during the morning, as her Government is facing a huge crisis. She travelled from Wood Farm, a five-bedroom cottage on the Sandringham estate back to Windsor Castle, and appeared in good health. A total of 42 MPs have resigned from the Government since Tuesday evening, in protest at Boris Johnson's conduct and standards. Home Secretary Priti Patel, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart were among the Cabinet ministers telling Mr Johnson to stand down.

In a latest development, Boris Johnson dramatically sacked Cabinet rival Michael Gove before calling him a “snake” in a No10 statement. Royal reporter Cameron Walker confirmed in a Twitter update that the weekly meeting of the PM with the Queen will go on. He wrote: “The Queen is expected to hold her weekly audience with the Prime Minister tonight via telephone.” The Queen has been holding weekly meetings with all Prime Ministers since she became the monarch in 1952.
