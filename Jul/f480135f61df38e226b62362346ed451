Cliff Richard was a vision in pink as he attended the Women's Singles Final at Wimbledon today. The Move It hitmaker, 81, stunned in a suit of varying shades of pink as he made an entrance at SW19. Sir Cliff was in good spirits as he arrived, wearing his signature sunglasses. The star, who looked younger than his 81 years, cut a smart figure in a perfectly fitted salmon pink jacket, which he paired with a pair of burgundy trousers and a matching shirt. Cliff finished off his outfit with a clashing, hot pink skinny tie and red rose pinned to his lapel.
