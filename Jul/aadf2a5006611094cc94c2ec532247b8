Scottish presenter Jean Johansson was tasked with finding Katie her dream holiday home in Paphos, Cyprus, on Tuesday's instalment of the Channel 4 property hunting programme. The search got off to a promising start, but it took a turn for the worse when Jean showed her a two-bedroom apartment in a location she was not keen on at all. She refused to look around the whole of the property, leaving Jean red-faced. Fitness instructor Katie was hoping to find a holiday home with sea views within a budget of £83,000.The mother-of-five was accompanied on the show by her 37-year-old son Michael as she wanted his advice.The first apartment they viewed was on the market for £77,000 and included one bedroom, a communal pool and views of the Mediterranean Sea.Katie and Michael were surprised by how spacious the apartment was, with Katie describing the view from the balcony as "gorgeous".

Jean wanted to please Michael and his mum, so she promised them she would find them a two-bedroom property to explore.When they approached the third property which was in another location and on the market for £91,000, a worried Jean exclaimed: "You're both so quiet, please talk to me."Katie fumed: "It's nothing as nice as the last couple of properties.""Don't hold back", Jean replied before the pair reluctantly agreed to look inside.

The following day, Katie and Michael met with Jean and put in an offer for £70,000 on the first apartment.Luckily the agent accepted her "cheeky" offer and Katie was ecstatic."I am so happy for Katie and Michael, they found the perfect property for their family and I wish them happiness," Jean added.A Place in the Sun continues on weekdays at 3pm on Channel 4.
