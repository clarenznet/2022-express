The reduction from 30mph aims to encourage people to walk and cycle more - and cut accidents with their associated healthcare costs. But mum Adie Drury has started a petition against the rollout, claiming it will lead to "bikes overtaking cars". The 39-year-old, whose local authority piloted the scheme earlier year, said: "The community has no problem with a 20mph limit where it's necessary, like outside schools, health centres in housing estates and in heavily pedestrianised areas. "I was raised on a housing estate and played football in the road when I was a child and it's good to invite the community into the road space - but it should be where it is appropriate." Adie, from Buckley, Flintshire, added: "You wouldn't want your child playing football in an arterial road so why is that being made 20mph? "Cyclists around here are having a whale of a time as they can do more than 20mph and we can't in our cars." Tory politicians have blasted the £32million plans, claiming the rules should be set by local councils and "those who know their roads best". Natasha Asghar, Welsh Conservatives Shadow Transport Minister, said: "We are not against introducing 20mph speed limits outside schools, playgrounds, places of worship and high streets - but a blanket rollout is quite frankly ludicrous." Those backing the change pointed to evidence that the chance of someone surviving a 20mph collision is seven times higher than at 30mph. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said: "We want to see this become the default position across Wales. We know 20mph zones reduce accidents - particularly to children. " The Welsh Government claims the move will save £58million over 30 years due to reduced emergency service demand and hospital treatment.
