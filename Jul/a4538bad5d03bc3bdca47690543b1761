Billy Bob Thornton, 66, attended the Hollywood premiere of Netflix' The Gray Man at the Chinese Theatre with his wife Connie Angland, 57. The A-list actor sported a black tank top, with black jeans and multiple silver chains. He covered his hair with a blue bandana and a black hat, while clipping his car keys to his belt. Connie meanwhile looked amazing in a pretty sheer black lace dress with a frayed end showing off her toned legs. Adding more length to her enviable pins she wore black strappy heels. They appeared to be in great spirits as they were joined by the film's main star Ryan Gosling. Billy was previously married to Angelina Jolie, however the marriage was short lived, only lasting for three years
