If Wordle is proving just a tad too easy for you, then you might want to make the move to Quordle. While it shares many similarities with Wordle, the difference with Quordle is that players must figure out four words instead of just one. Needless to say, fans are finding it extremely difficult to win a single game, let along build up a winning streak, which is why Express Online has put together a selection of spoiler-free hints and clues to help you solve Quordle 187 for July 30. Much like Wordle, Quordle players will need to pay attention to the colour of the tiles in order to succeed. If the tiles turn grey, then the letter doesn't appear in the word you are guessing. If it's yellow then the letter appears, just not in that particular spot. Finally, green tiles mean the letter appears in that exact position. The twist with Quordle is that when you guess a word it will appear in all four answer boxes. You can solve them in any order, so keep an eye on everything, because you may be able to knock out the third word before you've guessed the first one. One strategy is to get as many vowels in your opening guess as possible. Try words like ADIEU or AUDIO in your first attempt, as these letters will appear in more words. If you're not able to solve the first Quordle word in your second guess, then choose a word with five completely different letters in order to maximise your chances of solving each puzzle.
