The ATP rankings would have looked very different had points been allocated at this year's Wimbledon with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Cam Norrie benefitting. Djokovic captured a seventh Wimbledon title after defeating the controversial Nick Kyrgios in the final with the Serbian stressing the relief he felt to win another Grand Slam as he is set to miss the US Open, the final major of the tennis year.  He has increased his Grand Slam haul to 21 and remains just one behind Rafael Nadal and he is also within one Wimbledon title of equalling Roger Federer’s tally of eight. Although he lifted the prestigious trophy aloft on Centre Court this past Sunday, Djokovic did not receive any ranking points. The tournament was stripped of points by the ATP and WTA following the All-England Club’s decision to ban Russian and Belurusian players following the war in Ukraine. Had players involved at SW19 been awarded rankings points as normal then the current rankings would have looked very different. Current world number Daniil Medvedev, one of the players banned from Wimbledon, would have stayed at the summit even if ranking points were awarded. In fact, if he was allowed to play, he would have only needed to progress beyond the third round to increase his tally of 7,775. JUST IN: Rafael Nadal sends classy message to Novak Djokovic after Wimbledon win over Nick Kyrgios However, with Alexander Zverev missing the tournament due to injury, Nadal would have moved up to No 2 as he would have picked up 720 points for reaching the semi-final for the eighth time in his career. Djokovic, who has plummeted to seventh in the world, would have ascended to the fourth spot behind the German and would have remained on 6,770 points after retaining his Wimbledon title. It is a case of as you were for Stefanos Tsitsipas and Casper Ruud as they improved on last year’s results as the former would have added 90 points to his total and Ruud 45. Alcaraz dropped 45 points, but he would have picked up 180 for reaching the fourth round while Félix Auger-Aliassime lost in the first round. Finalist Kyrgios is currently at No 45 with 980 points, but he would have had 2,180 points after adding 1,200 to his total, which would have placed him back inside the top 20. Along with the Wimbledon champion, another hit hardest by the lack of ranking points is British number one Cam Norrie who would have been lifted inside the top-10.  Norrie finds himself at No 11 with 3,155 points after dropping 45 points, but he would have been comfortably at No 8 with 3,875 points (+720) for reaching the first grand slam semi-final of his career. The Italian meanwhile, was always going to drop down the ranking after losing the 1,200 points for making the 2021 final. Here is a list of how the top 10 would look if Wimbledon awarded ranking points this year. 1. Daniil Medvedev – 7,775 (-) 2. Rafael Nadal Spain 6,885 (+720) 3. Alexander Zverev Germany 6,850 (-) 4. Novak Djokovic Serbia 6,770 (+2,000) 5. Stefanos Tsitispas Greece 5,240 (+90) 6. Casper Ruud Norway 5,095 (+45) 7. Carlos Alcaraz Spain 5,085 (+240) 8. Cameron Norrie Great Britain 3,875 (+720) 9.
