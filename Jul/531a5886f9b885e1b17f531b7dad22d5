Dashcam footage shows the youths pull out in front of the driver at the junction in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. The trio jeers at the motorist and speed off after the dangerous manoeuvre. The man behind the wheel, who wishes to remain anonymous, slammed his brakes to avoid a collision at the roundabout in the north of the town. Speaking to Teesside Live, the motorist said: "I was really shocked that this happened and I hope getting the video out there can stop future incidents happening like this again. Maybe this video will prevent someone from being killed." In the video, the men show a lack of care as they approach the roundabout. All three teens do not appear to be wearing helmets or protective gear as the rear passenger's legs dangle from the bike. The trio then appear to have jeered and made hand gestures towards the motorist, who has shared his anger and shock at the incident which could have ended in tragedy. Now he hopes by sharing the video it will raise awareness and prevent future incidents like this from happening. Last week, dashcam footage of a lethal crash re-ignited a fierce debate on road safety. The footage, from 2008, shows possibly the fastest speeds ever recorded on a road in Cornwall. It captures a man in his 40s reaching a staggering 170mph on July 13, 2008, as well as fellow biker friend Andrew Prowse, who was 45, speeding across the roads. The pair broke the speed limit more than 30 times in a matter of minutes, getting well above 100mph on several occasions and having multiple near misses. The pair then went across Loggans Moor Roundabout in Hayle, Cornwall, before attempting to get back up to speed. Prowse attempted to overtake a car at speed, but clipped it and was sent flying into the other carriageway.
