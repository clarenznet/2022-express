Nicola Peltz, 27, has revealed she calls her husband Brooklyn Beckham, 23, an utterly adorable nickname - crumpet. The daughter of billionaire Nelson Peltz posted a loved up selfie with Brooklyn, the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham. In view of her 2.7million Instagram followers, Nicola could be seen squeezing her hubbie’s face as they pouted side by side. “I love you my crumpet,” she wrote. She also uploaded a series of holiday snaps as they relaxed on a yacht together with some of Nicola’s family, including her son-in-law Asher. Possibly feeling broody, Nicola wrote: “My heart is a puddle,” as Brooklyn beamed while holding the youngster.
