In England, an estimated 2,873,600 people had Covid in the week to July 6, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 334,000 cases in Scotland, 183,500 in Wales, and 107,600 in Northern Ireland. This is a national rise of around a third (29 percent) and it is being driven by fast-spreading sub-variants of Omicron, called BA.4 and BA.5. Sarah Crofts, chief analyst at the ONS, said infections “are showing no signs of decreasing” and suggested they could reach pandemic highs this summer – which could throw public services into chaos. She said: “Infections are showing no signs of decreasing, with rates approaching levels last seen in March this year at the peak of the Omicron BA.2 wave. “Rates have continued to increase across the UK and among all age groups. We will continue to closely monitor the data.” The ONS estimated that 2.8 million people had the virus in England last week, the equivalent of one in 19 – up from one in 25, or 2.15 million, the previous week. Infections rose in every part of the UK. In Wales, the figure stood at 183,500, or roughly one in 17, and in Northern Ireland it was 107,600, or one in 17. Scotland had the highest rates, with one in 16 believed to have been infected. Worryingly, the current national infection estimate is the sixth week in a row that cases have risen and the highest number since early April. Hospital admissions of people in England with Covid are also rising, at a time when staff sickness is already wreaking havoc on the NHS. The rate of admissions stood at 17.9 per 100,000 people in the week ending July 10, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This is up from 15.7 per 100,000 the week before but is the smallest rise for several weeks. But vaccines are still doing a good job of helping protect people from getting ill with the virus. Dr Mary Ramsay, UKHSA director of clinical programmes, said: "We urge all those who are eligible for the spring booster to take up the offer as soon as possible." "Anyone who has not yet had their first or second dose should also get up-to-date with their jabs to give themselves the best possible protection.”
