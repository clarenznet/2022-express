Nadiya Bychkova, 32, and boyfriend Kai Widdrington, 26, looked like a fairytale couple as they attended this evening's Attitude Pride Awards ceremony. The Strictly stars were joined by Giovanni Pernice and Neil Jones at the event. Nadiya stunned in a light blue chiffon gown, featuring an elegant trail. The dress also featured a belt element round the waist, drawing in her petite frame. Meanwhile, Kai looked very dapper in a black suit paired with a grey tie.
