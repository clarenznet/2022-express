Interim guidance issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in May had suggested only over-65s would be eligible. But ministers are reportedly considering widening the rollout to keep hospital admissions under control next winter. Almost 2.3 million people were estimated to have had Covid in the UK in the week to June 24. A letter sent to NHS leaders has outlined the next steps for the vaccination programme, asking them to prepare for both a “minimum scenario”, where only over-65s are eligible, and a “maximum scenario”, where all over-50s need boosters. Dr Kit Yates, of the University of Bath, said: “With many people coming up to a year since their last dose, we should be thinking of offering everyone the potential for renewed protection this autumn.”
