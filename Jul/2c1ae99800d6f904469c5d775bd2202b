Madonna, 63, was seen being guided into a car by a male friend before pouting in a series of close-up selfies. The star was clutching a glass of wine as she entered the vehicle.  She captioned the photos: “Going nowhere fast” as she posted them in full view of her 18.4 million followers.  The Queen of Pop was dressed in black fishnets and dark skirt alongside a see-through top over a floral patterned corset-bra.  In further shots, Madonna was seen dancing in her living room in the same outfit, accessorised with silver jewellery.  The look was completed with dark designer shades and her blonde locks worn loose as they brushed over her shoulders.
