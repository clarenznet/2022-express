Scientists say they are up by around 16.5cm since 1900. But the Met Office says they are now growing by up to 5.2mm every year due to climate change. The figure is more than double the rate noted in the early 20th century.  The National Oceanographic Centre’s Dr Svetlana Jevrejeva blamed an “increased rate of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets” along with melting glaciers and ocean warming. She said this was already having an impact: “Last year storm surges of over 1.5m were seen during Storm Arwen, but extreme sea levels were avoided as this occurred during low water and a neap tide.” Separate research from World Weather Attribution suggests human actions made last week’s 104.54F (40.3C) record heatwave at least 10 times more likely.
