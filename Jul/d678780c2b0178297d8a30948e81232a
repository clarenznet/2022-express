Thunder and lightning has battered the South West and south Wales, bringing in heavy rainfall and thunderstorms in thick grey clouds. Residents in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly were "relieved" to see the sky "go black and the rain start pouring" in the early hours of Tuesday morning, according to Lucy McRobert, communications manager for the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust. The Met Office said: "A line of showers is moving north and east as shown in the latest radar sequence. However the rain is falling into very dry air so very little of the rain is reaching the ground." UK Thunderstorms noted this morning: “A few thunderstorms are currently impacting Cornwall right now. These will move NW throughout the day and may impact other areas of SW England, and potentially Wales.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
