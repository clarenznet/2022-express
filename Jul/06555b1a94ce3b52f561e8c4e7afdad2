One of the things the TV presenter, 52, has changed is quitting booze in a bid to stop her illness coming back. She said: "Historically, I haven't been kind to my body or my gut. I had a reputation for drinking everybody else under the table." "But right now, I don't feel comfortable drinking alcohol because if I drink one unit of alcohol a day, my risk of recurrence is between five and six per cent across my lifetime." "With four units a day, it goes up to 28 percent."  Julia, who has three children aged seven to 11, announced her diagnosis last September and had a mastectomy in October. Her left breast and two lymph glands were removed before reconstruction took place. She told Woman & Home magazine's latest issue: "My whole mantra for life has become 'be grateful for what you do have, not what you don't'. "I have a breast, I have my nipple but I don't have sensation. Because I'm naturally slim, I have what I call the mozzarella-cheese effect around, as my friend Ben Shephard and I call it, my pneumatic boob."  "Because my skin is very thin, you can really see the silicone implant beneath and it will be that way unless I have another procedure to inject fat from somewhere else. I don't want to do that." The former Countryfile presenter added: "It would purely be for aesthetics. In your 50s and 60s, femininity is still part of your identity, but it's not the be-all and end-all." The September issue of Woman& Home is on sale from today.
