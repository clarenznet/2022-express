But operators warn that accommodation is running out, with just a fortnight until schools break up. Gill Haigh, of Cumbria Tourism, said: "We always recommend booking in advance." The UK tourism industry has been decimated by coronavirus, with Visit Britain estimating the economy took a £97billion hit because of the virus. Last year the industry lost £58billion alone. Some 70 percent of Britons say they will holiday here rather than risk travelling abroad, according to analysis by Visit Britain. The worsening situation at airports, where thousands of flights have been cancelled, massive queues for check-in and security, and strikes throughout Europe means this summer could be the best opportunity for Britain to sell itself as a top-table holiday destination. Oliver Barker, who runs Catgill Farm campsite in the Yorkshire Dales, said: "Bookings have been good this year and we are definitely seeing an increase. "The weather forecast is great, airports look like a nightmare . "When combining this with the squeeze on everyone's income due to the high rate of inflation, it's leading to more people holidaying in the UK. "Camping is very affordable, and when the sun is shining you really wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
