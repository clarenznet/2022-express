A fire broke out overnight in the north-western Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where Russian forces had set up their base. In a video posted by Eastern European media channel NEXTA TV, a hotel is seen catching fire after being hit by the Ukrainian military. The blow to Putin's army came as the Ukrainian military said it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps in fighting in the Kherson region, the focus of Kyiv's counter-offensive in the south and a key link in Moscow's supply lines. Rail traffic to Kherson over the Dnipro River had been cut, the military's southern command said, potentially further isolating Russian forces west of the river from supplies in occupied Crimea and the east.
