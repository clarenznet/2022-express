Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, stunned as she and husband Michael Douglas, 77, attended the wedding of Olympian Scotty James and singer Chloe Stroll in Cannes, France, on Saturday. Catherine looked absolutely gorgeous in a sheer black dress that was covered in diamante stars. The Chicago actress wore the dress over a strapless black swimsuit and added some height with wedges. She added some more sparkle with a silver handbag and Michael looked smart in a pink shirt with white trousers Catherine wore her hair down at first before switching to an updo as she braved the heat.
