  The Wrestler star Mickey Rourke, 69, has claimed he was unfairly cancelled, comparing his case to that of Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, 59. Mickey also slammed Johnny’s ex-wife Amber Heard, 36, who recently lost the defamation lawsuit.      Mickey opened up about his own experience with cancel culture during a candid interview on Talk TV on Tuesday. Chatting to Piers Morgan, 57, he compared his situation to Johnny’s in the wake of his high-profile lawsuit against Amber. Mickey said: “Well, you know, I know Johnny for many years, but I don't really know him intimately. “All I could say is I was in a situation one time where I got blamed for something that I didn’t do.

He went on to say that he therefore “felt bad” for Johnny, claiming there had been attempts to “chop him down”.    Johnny and Mickey worked together back in 2003 on the film Once Upon A Time in Mexico. The Iron Man 2 actor has spoken out in defence of Johnny before, ahead of his explosive trial against ex-wife Amber. In May 2016, Mickey told TMZ: “He doesn't seem like a very violent man to me.” READ MORE...

When the trial between Johnny and Amber came to a climactic end last month, the Edward Scissorhands star was awarded $10million in compensation and $5million in punitive damages. Amber, who will have a chance to appeal the verdict, won $2million back in compensatory damages after winning one of her claims in the countersuit, but $0 in punitive damages for her countersuit. Johnny sued his ex-wife over a 2018 article in the Washington Post, in which she claimed to have become a figure representing domestic abuse.         The actress didn’t name Johnny, but the A-lister claimed he was the implied abuser and that it cost him acting jobs including his famous role of Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean.
