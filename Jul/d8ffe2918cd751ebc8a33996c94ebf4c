Max Verstappen will be desperate to pip the likes of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton to pole position in today's qualifying session at the British Grand Prix. The Dutchman currently boasts a comfortable lead in the Drivers' Championship standings and will have a golden chance to make the most of Red Bull's pace around the twists and turns of Silverstone when the five red lights go out tomorrow afternoon. He will be determined to give himself the best chance of victory by securing a place at the front of the grid with a scintillating lap in a potentially wet qualifying session today. Rain has been forecast at Silverstone but it remains to be seen if the track will stay dry enough to avoid giving all 20 drivers a hard time at the home of British racing. Hamilton won last year's British Grand Prix but will surely face a hugely difficult task in securing a front-row start, with Mercedes still having failed to eradicate the bouncing that has plagued their efforts over the course of this season to date. The 37-year-old complained about the problem during Friday's practice sessions but still managed to finish just behind the leaders in spite of the issue, which looks set to continue for the Silver Arrows into qualifying ahead of tomorrow's race.
