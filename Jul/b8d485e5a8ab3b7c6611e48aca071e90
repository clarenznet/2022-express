Britons are bracing for exceptional heat over the next couple of days, with forecasters predicting temperatures to soar to 40C and higher. A Met Office red weather warning for heat is in place from midnight on Monday until 11.59 pm on Tuesday evening, with the experts warning of "widespread impacts on people and infrastructure". The staggering temperatures have reached heatwave status and triggered a national emergency, with potential disruption to travel, gritters due to spread sand on roads to reduce melting and some schools closing early. BBC Weather presenter Matt Taylor said there is now a realistic possibility of hitting 40C in the UK. He said: "That is exceptionally hot, the sort of temperatures that if you are on holiday you may be able to deal with but in day-to-day life it can have severe impacts on health." Met Office CEO Penny Endersby said the extreme heat forecast was "absolutely unprecedented". Ms Endersby is calling for Britons to take the warning as seriously as a red or amber warning for snow or wind. She said hot weather is usually seen as a "chance to go and play in the sun" but "this is not that sort of weather". Britons are being urged to keep hydrated, keep an eye on their pets and check in with any elderly or vulnerable relatives and neighbours.
