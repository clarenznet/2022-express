Susanna Reid diffused tensions on the ITV breakfast show after a climate change campaigner accused Good Morning Britain of missing opportunities to tell the British public the truth. The row began when the panel discussed protests on the Silverstone Grand Prix track.  A row between presenter and former politician Ed Balls and guest James Skeet left Susanna Reid to put out the fire as tensions exploded. The pair were discussing the recent stand off at Silverstone during the British Grand Prix this weekend. Seven people were arrested after blocking the track during a race red-flag for a major incident on the first lap which saw a number of cars involved in a huge crash. Feathers were first ruffled after Ed likened the work of the Silverstone track protestors to terrorist attacks. "It's also an unfair accusation to say we're not very hard on the government." With that, she thanked the guest and moved on to greet the next interviewee for the beginning of a new debate. Susanna's morning didn't get much brighter however as further fiery words were exchanged with Children and Families Minister Will Quince. Of course, the debate didn't end with the on air discussion, Twitter users had their say too. @Shel66817148 said: "What an absolute chop. Extremely aggressive towards GMB." While Charron Pugsley-Hill disagreed posting, "I would say Ed was talking over him etc and he got fed up unsurprisingly." Steve Carr called out Just Stop Oil directly after the protest group quoted a video tweet by Good Morning Britain saying: "You need another spokesperson, that lunatic got schooled and set you back. "You need to solutionize not run onto a race track and try and kill people."
