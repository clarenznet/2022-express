Nicholas Hytner's modern-dress production gets up close and personal. Although the G Plan furniture suggests it is set in the 1970s, it could just as easily be today - or tomorrow. The shadow of unstable republics hovers over this visceral, rip-snorting production aimed squarely at the next generation of theatre-goers. Think Shakespeare is boring? Think again. This is genuinely exciting. Available to rent at Â£7.99 for three days. Online tickets: ntathome.com
