Strictly Come Dancingâ€™s Nadiya Bychkova, 32, looked fantastic as she soaked up the sunshine in Sicily. The professional dancer took to Instagram yesterday to share an insight into her day at the beach with her 138,000 followers. Nadiya donned an asymmetric burgundy bikini that put her slim figure on display as she splashed around in the water. The blonde beauty completed the summery look with a middle-parted low bun and some dark shades.
