Cameron Norrie feels he is "ready" to make the step up after becoming the first British male to reach the last-16 of Wimbledon for five years. Norrie set his own milestone with the one-sided victory over Steve Johnson in finally making it through to the fourth round of a major.  Norrie had previously fallen at the third round in each Grand Slam, but now moves onto the fourth round for the first time in his career. He takes on No 30 seed Tommy Paul in the next round but also faces a relatively straightforward draw all the way to the semi-final. There he could meet No 1 seed Novak Djokovic and Norrie clearly doesn't want his career-best Wimbledon run to stop just yet. When asked about how he will handle with becoming the first British male to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon since Andy Murray in 2017, Norrie said: "I'm as ready as I can be. "I've been training as hard as I can. It's been a tricky grass season but I've peaked at the right time."  "I'm definitely moving better and feeling a lot better on the court so I'll take that." Norrie was also thrilled to break his Grand Slam duck, especially with his family there to watch. "It feels really good, especially here at Wimbledon, at home," he said. "First time in the second week of a Grand Slam and I couldn't be happier especially with all my friends and family watching me.   "It's good timing that they're here. I enjoyed that match today and it was a bit less stressful than the last round for my squad. I'm enjoying playing at this level, the process and enjoying improving with my coach and my team. "We all have the same goals and we're all pushing each other - it's been a lot of fun and I want to keep going and keep ticking all boxes."
