Ajmal Mushtaq is the CEO of Boss Pizza UK. He uses his online platform to share money and business tips and tricks with his almost 30k followers. He made one video highlighting the rising price of petrol and just how much the Government is taking at the pumps. He said: "(It costs) £1.82 for one litre of fuel. How much of that is for the petrol station?" Ajmal asked members of the public filling their cars on the forecourt, many of whom had no idea how much petrol stations make per litre. One said, "no clue" while another said, "hard pass, I don't know." One guess petrol stations make 60p from each litre of fuel sold. Another guessed 10p and one guess £1. One woman was close to the real figure, 3p, guessing 4p. When she learned about the real figure she said: "Ridiculous isn't it?" So if petrol stations are taking just 3p, where does the rest of your money go?

There is no point. "They are earning a pittance compared to what the Government is taking." Ajmal's followers were quick to comment on the video, most showing a sense of anger towards the Government. One wrote: "But nobody will stand up to the Government ripping us off every day." Another said: "And then the Government acts like they don’t control the fuel prices." "Government make bank on fuel. They’re rolling in it," another said. Ajmal replied: "Exactly. It’s a scandal." The video has had a whopping 523,000 views on the platform TikTok.
