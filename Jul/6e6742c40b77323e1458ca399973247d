The Portugal captain has asked for any offers for him to be considered despite the excitement at Old Trafford around the start of Erik ten Hag's reign. United are in the process of wrapping up their first signing in the form of Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia and continue in their long-standing attempts to sign Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona. While Tottenham have made a whole host of signings and Arsenal are poised to unveil Gabriel Jesus as their latest capture, though they still want more new faces. Chelsea are another team looking to ramp up their summer business as pre-season gets underway with Thomas Tuchel potentially spending up to £200million before the end of August.
