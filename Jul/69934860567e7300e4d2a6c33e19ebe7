Rafael Nadal cruised into the quarter-finals at Wimbledon with a comfortable straight-sets victory over Botic van de Zandschulp on Monday evening. The Spaniard produced a hugely dominant showing to brush his Dutch opponent aside and set up an exciting last-eight meeting with Taylor Fritz, although he needed a third-set tiebreak to wrap up the result. Van de Zandschulp was able to get off to a promising start and matched Nadal in the opening exchanges but was unable to prevent the 36-year-old from breaking at 5-4 up in set one to draw first blood. The latter went on to turn the screw as the match progressed, winning the second set at a canter in just over 30 minutes. A straight-sets victory looked to be on the cards from that point onwards, although Van de Zandschulp refused to roll over and go down without a fight. He managed to force an unlikely tiebreak in the third set, with Nadal wasting no less than three match points as the Dutchman fought back from the brink. The two-time Wimbledon champion eventually managed to get the job done, though, to maintain his hopes of winning a third Grand Slam title since the beginning of the year. "I think I continued in a positive way until the end, where I played a bad game," said Nadal in his post-match interview on Centre Court. "I played a good match against a difficult opponent and I wish him all the best. "In a personal way, for me to be able to be in quarter-finals after three years it's amazing for me so very, very happy." ReliveÂ Express Sport's live match updates below.
