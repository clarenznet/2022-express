Christie Brinkley put her jaw-dropping physique on full display as she donned a black swimsuit on the July cover of Social Life magazine. In a new interview, the model opened up on her secret to maintaining her age-defying looks - which she largely put down to practising gratitude and a low-sugar diet - as she showcased her incredible physique in an eye-popping swimsuit. Christie talks about practicing gratitude daily, her connection to nature and climate change concerns, her zero carb, zero sugar Prosecco line, Bellissima and who she would like to keep her company if stranded on a desert island. Dishing on the secret to her happiness, she explained: "You know a lot of people ask me, ‘Why are you always smiling?’ . . . ‘Why do you seem so happy no matter what?’ "I really think at the root of everything is true gratitude. I know gratitude is an overused word right now, but sometimes sayings become cliché because they’re true. "Gratitude is what works for me, and I start every day by counting all the reasons I have to be grateful. I start with my kids and by the end of the list how can I not be happy? Counting my blessings is truly the secret to happiness and being full of energy and life!" The model also addressed her organic and vegan Prosecco wines, saying: "The zero-sugar sparkling wine was a runaway hit and a personal favorite of mine. "I love the idea that I can enjoy a glass of wine and stick to my healthy lifestyle. These wines are great for anyone who wants to reduce their sugar consumption and it’s especially beneficial to people on a keto diet."
