Valtteri Bottas aimed a cheeky jibe at his former team Mercedes after joking that he won't be joining Aston Martin because he finally has a contract longer than one season. The Finn was famously handed one-year contracts for the entirety of his time with the Silver Arrows by Toto Wolff and chose to joke at his former team's expense. The Finn departed the eight-time constructors’ champions last season after five years with the team, where he played the role of deputy to Lewis Hamilton. The lack of job security with the German manufacturer played a key role in Bottas’ move to join Alfa Romeo, where he signed a multi-year contract. And asked about his future following the announcement that Sebastian Vettel was retiring at the end of the season, Bottas could not resist a thinly-veiled dig at his former employers. "I never believed I could say this, but I have a contract! So I'm good,” he said, prompting laughter from all quarters of the media room.
