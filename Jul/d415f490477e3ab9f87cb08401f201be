It is believed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were at their mansion in Montecito with their children Archie and Lilibet when the alarms were triggered. Santa Barbara Police records show that officers went to the £11million home on the couple's wedding anniversary on May 19.  Police arrived at 5.44pm local time following a report of a trespasser, the Sun reported. They returned for a second intruder alert on May 31 at 3.21pm just hours before the Sussexes boarded a private jet to the UK for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Both calls in May were logged as “trespasser”, “property crimes” and “suspicious circumstances”, it has been reported. According to police records, there have been six security alert calls to their US home in the past 14 months.  On April 9, 2021, police were sent at 2.52am after a call, but were called off as “no assistance was needed”. On New Year’s Day this year, at 1.43am, the alarm was “mistakenly tripped” and a squad car sent. It is unclear if the Sussexes were at home at the time. Police were then called on April 8 at 10.41am, but did not attend as the call “belonged to another agency”.

However, these were not the first incidents at the Sussexes home. On Christmas Eve 2020 a man allegedly trespassed before returning on Boxing Day and being arrested. While in the US, the Sussexes have reportedly recruited a security team including Barack Obama's former bodyguard Christopher Sanchez and Michael Jackson's former security chief Alberto Alvarez.
