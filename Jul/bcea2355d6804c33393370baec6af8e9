You are starting to respect and admire someone who has taken charge of a team activity and you have a strong feeling you will be doing more together in the future. A group project is going from strength to strength. This is your chance to make a difference in the lives of those who need a helping hand. You don’t have to abide by someone else’s wishes especially if a situation you are both involved in isn’t to your liking. Why continue if it makes you miserable? Instead, you might refuse someone’s request to do something that goes against your conscience. Follow your instincts. A flurry of social activities could hit your pocket hard. It won’t help knowing there are bills that soon need to be paid and although you would rather spend than save, it would be sensible and wise to get some cash into the bank to cover these coming expenditures.  Arguments, upheavals and frustrations will be hard on your nerves especially if it feels like one crisis follows another and you aren’t getting a break from all this tension. You don’t have to handle this on your own. Accept the help of your family and friends when it is offered. Private, special moments shared with your amour will be the kind you will hold in your heart for a long time to come. Are you single and looking for love? Posting a profile on a dating site could improve the odds of you finding a compatible partner. Up until midday the hours will amble along with nothing, in particular, going on. An evening social event or get-together with some special friends will add a touch of excitement to your day. After a sale where expenses have been heavy, income will now balance with everyday expenditures.  There are concerns about the future of a social or music venue where you have enjoyed many happy hours. A fundraising venture could make a difference to a place that means so much to you and many others. Fun social events always help uplift and sustain you. An award announcement, love message or developments in a romantic relationship will uplift you. Are you single and looking for love? Be prepared to mix, mingle and get your face seen to meet the partner of your dreams. A social invitation should not be ignored. This is the type of event you aren’t likely to see again. Plan your time carefully. You don’t want to end up feeling pressure trying to squeeze in as much as you can at the end of the day. If you’re working on anything important, give yourself plenty of time to go into the details. There could be more to a situation than you suspect.  Either you will find the challenging atmosphere that suddenly occurs as a result of unexpected change stimulating and exciting. Or you will long for a certain event or situation to be over. What will surprise you most is how swift you are to react in unexpected circumstances. A group project is launched and because you had a lot to do with the planning and organising, you will be determined that this is a venture you will see through to the very end. People are relying on you and there is every chance you will fulfil this intention. It’s frustrating to have to leave some plans hanging in the air when you can’t contact people or when you do you can’t get the information you need out of them to make a definitive agreement. If it’s up to you to make arrangements, all you can do is make choices based on the little information you have been given.
