Royal expert Daniela Elser said Prince Harry should take some inspiration from the Suffragettes if he wants to change the world. Referencing the image of Prince Harry delivering a speech to only a handful of people in the United Nation’s main chamber, she said the Duke should remember Emmeline Pankhurst’s phrase “deeds not words”. She said: “If he needs some inspiration of his own then he should not look any further than suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst who incidentally was arrested outside Buckingham Palace in 1914 and knew a thing or two about fighting to change the world. “The motto of the movement she led? ‘Deeds not words.’” Ms Elser said the Duke was in “dire need” of a change of direction as his “post-royal career started to look like it is dangerously close to going down the PR gurgler.”
