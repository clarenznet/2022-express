Omid Scobie, co-author of the unauthorised biography of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex 'Finding Freedom', said Buckingham Palace appears to be ditching the Queen's mantra "never complain, never explain" in favour of a "deflect and distract" tactic. Mr Scobie suggested the decision to provide journalists with an insight into the first meeting between Lili and Prince Charles as the financial review for April 2021-2022 was being presented helped take away the attention from the criticism the heir to the throne faced after it was reported he personally accepted donations in cash for The Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim - Prime Minister of Qatar between 2007 and 2013 - between 2011 and 2015. While Charles wasn't accused of any wrongdoing and Clarence House assured a similar situation would "not happen again", some of his critics raised questions about the future King's judgement. In an op-ed penned for Yahoo! News, Mr Scobie wrote: "You see, when the Prince of Wales was forced to announce via his spokesman that he will never again accept plastic bags filled with €500 notes for his charities, one of his senior aides also briefed journalists with adorable details of the heir’s first time meeting granddaughter Lilibet last month. "(Yes, one of the same private family moments royal sources had 'feared' the Sussexes would leak. The irony)." The biographer, who has at times been described as a supporter of Meghan and Harry, also called the update provided by the Palace regarding the probe into allegations of bullying made against the Duchess of Sussex by Kensington Palace staff on the same day of the release of the financial report "suspiciously timed". The Palace did not share the findings of the review but said its HR policies had been improved as a result of the probe. Meghan always denied the allegations of bullying made against her.
