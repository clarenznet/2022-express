The acclaimed shotstopper won five Scottish Premier League titles in a trophy laden golden spell at Glasgow Rangers in the 1990s and was capped 43 times by his country. Goram went to four major tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s and is the only man to play both international football and cricket for Scotland. He also made an appearance for Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United on their way to the Premier League title in 2000-2001. In a long and successful career Goram played for clubs including Oldham Athletic, Hibernian and Motherwell and was more recently goalkeeping coach for Cambuslang Rangers in the West Of Scotland Football League. Andrew Lewis Goram was born in Bury, Lancashire and after being released by West Brom as a teenager, he spent seven years at Oldham, making the 1986-87 Second Division Team Of The Year. He signed for Hibs that summer, a team his father briefly played for, and captained the club for most of his four-year spell. Rangers signed him for Â£1million in 1991 and he played in every competitive game that season as his new club lifted the Scottish Premier League title.
