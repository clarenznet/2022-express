Ben Affleck, 49, tied the knot with Jennifer Lopez, 53, last weekend in a surprise Las Vegas ceremony, 20 years after they called off their first engagement. The pair were pictured today in Paris as they continued their honeymoon as well as celebrating Jennifer's birthday. The hit singer turned heads in an eye-popping pink midi dress, showing off her ample assets. The dress drew in her petite waist, and she accessorised with wedge heels, gold jewellery and large sunglasses. Ben, meanwhile cut a casual figure in a blue shirt and matching dark blue trousers with a pair of brown smart shoes. The Hollywood couple were joined by Ben's two children, Violet, 16, and Seraphina, 13, as well as Jennifer's child Emme, 14. Jennifer last month introduced Emme using "they/them" pronouns as they duetted at the Las Vegas Dodgers Foundation Blue Diamond Gala.
