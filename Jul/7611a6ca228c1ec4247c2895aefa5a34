New footage of Jennifer Lopez shows the age-defying 52-year-old flaunting her flawless bikini body in a bright yellow bralet, while another shot showed her experimenting with a lipstick almost the same shade of yellow. She also showcased her ample derriere for the cameras, before the words "Booty" flashed up on the screen, and revealed shots of herself with just a large leaf disguising her modesty. Advertising her JLo Beauty brand to her followers, she teasingly captioned the sizzling post: "#SummerOfBooty @JLoBeauty #SomethingIsComing." Viewers with the sound up were treated to her vocal rendition of 'Dat Sexy Body', originally recorded by the Jamaican artist Sasha. They also heard vocal snippets from the feisty singer, actress and model's 2014 collaboration with Pitbull, known simply as 'Booty'. The 52-year-old powerhouse simultaneously showed off her figure and dance moves as she posted a sexy mashup video to promote her JLo Beauty brand.
