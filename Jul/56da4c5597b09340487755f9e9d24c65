Jane Seymour has showcased her enviably toned legs as she took a dip at her luxury mansion in Malibu, California. The Hollywood actress, 71, was all smiles as she flashed her flash in a navy swimsuit and white and blue patterned sarong. Jane took to the caption to reveal how she's staying cool, writing: "Sunny and warm? It sounds like the perfect time for a dip! "When was the last time you went for a swim and where? "Of course, #WrappedInLoveJS with my ’Butterflies Are Free’ scarf!" she ended her post.
