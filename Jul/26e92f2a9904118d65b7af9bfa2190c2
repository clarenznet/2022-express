Penny Lancaster, 51, looked amazing as she updated her Instagram followers on her recent USA trip. The Loose Women panellist took to Instagram to share a short video with her 158,000 followers showing off her enviably toned pins. Penny shared the 360-degree video with her followers as she posed along with her son Alastair and other relatives. The former model made sure to lead with some flirty poses including air kisses and love heart hand gestures. She looked great in the long-sleeved black playsuit as she joked around with her son and friends. Penny has posted several snaps from her USA trip with her husband Rod Stewart, sons Alastair and Aiden, along with other family and friends.
