Rescue teams have been deployed to the scenes and have reported damage to the front of one of the schools. Critical infrastructure - including public transport links - has been destroyed as a result of one of the blasts. The second rocket fell in the playground near another school but there have not yet been any reported casualties. Targetting civilian infrastructure is considered a violation of international law and constitutes war crime. These violations are being investigated and discussed by the international community in The Hague. Commenting on Putin's decision to continue bombing civilians at a time when The Hague was holding a conference on Russian war crimes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: "No other terrorist organisation has the audacity to kill again when the international community is discussing previous crimes. Russia has thus shown its attitude to international law, to Europe, and to the entire civilised world."  FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
