The vessel, known as LÉ Róisín, has also visited the Welsh capital due to the recent opening of the Irish Consulate in Cardiff. LÉ Róisín is the lead ship of her class of offshore patrol vessel in the Irish Naval Service, reports Wales Online.  Prior to its arrival, Consul general of Ireland Denise Hanrahan said: "I am delighted that Cardiff Bay will be home to the Irish navy’s LÉ Róisín from July 18 to 20. "We look forward to welcoming many visitors on board in celebration of the close connections between Wales and Ireland and to express our appreciation for all the support we have had in establishing Ireland’s diplomatic presence in Wales. "Our maritime heritage and the Irish Sea are central to the diverse and vibrant cultural, economic, and community relationships between Ireland and Wales." The ship is open for public viewings today, July 19, until 5pm. The visits are free of charge. LÉ Róisín is docked at Britannia Quay in Cardiff Bay a short walk from the Wales Millennium Centre. On Twitter the Irish Consulate account wrote: "This is a rare opportunity to visit a ship, meet the crew, & learn about their experiences of seafaring! A fantastic day out for all the family." According to the Irish Government the establishment of a Consulate General in Wales demonstrates the government’s commitment to strengthening the British-Irish relationship following the UK’s departure from the EU. The Ireland-Wales Shared Statement and Joint Action Plan 2021-25 was launched in March 2021. It sets out the ambitions and plans for the Ireland-Wales relationship in the years ahead as both countries work to increase cooperation and collaboration between both governments and other partners.
