The numbers have soared by almost two thirds (57 per cent) over the past four years and increased sharply since the beginning of the pandemic. There are currently 350 approvals for the drugs issued every day on the NHS in England. “Medication can play an important role in helping a young person manage their mental health but should never be a substitute for talking therapies such as counselling. Long-waiting times and high thresholds for treatment may mean that GPs feel under pressure to prescribe medication, but it shouldn’t be used as a sticking plaster for poor access to other forms of support. “We desperately need extra investment in mental health services, especially in early support so that young people have somewhere to turn when problems start.” The new figures follow a warning from a senior coroner who said the NHS mental health services are failing young people. Her comments followed the suicide of 14-year old Robyn Skilton from Horsham, West Sussex, who hanged herself in a park in May last year. Despite real concerns about her mental health Robyn did not get a face to face consultation and was continually turned down for assessments throughout the pandemic. In her conclusion coroner Penelope Scholfield concluded the NHS was guilty of “neglect.” She has written to health secretary Sajid Javid warning that there is a “clear risk” young people will succumb to mental illness if urgent action is not taken to improve services. An NHS spokesperson said: “The pandemic has inevitably had an impact on the nation’s mental health and the NHS is supporting more children and young people than ever before. “That is why the NHS fast-tracked the nationwide rollout of 24/7 crisis lines -providing support to hundreds of thousands of children and adults every month, rolled out comprehensive crisis services, including intensive home treatment for children and young people, and has offered up to 2.4 million pupils mental health support at school.”
