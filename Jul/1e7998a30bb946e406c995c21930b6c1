 John Cleese, 82, has taken to Twitter to share a snap alongside his rarely-seen daughter, Camilla Cleese, 38. The pair posed for a playful photo in full view of John’s 5.7 million followers. As the former Monty Python actor sat down with a gleeful grin on his face, his daughter crouched cheekily beside him, pulling a silly face as she wrapped her arm around the comedian. In the caption, he wrote: “I thought we were taking a nice photo together @camillacleese! This is what you get when your daughter is a comic.” John was dressed in a blue shirt buttoned a quarter of the way down, wearing a beige blazer over the top. Meanwhile, Camilla looked cosy and smart in blue jeans, a plain white tee and a light beige sweater. Camilla, a comedian and actor by profession, is one of John’s two children with Fawlty Towers co-star and ex-wife, Connie Booth.
