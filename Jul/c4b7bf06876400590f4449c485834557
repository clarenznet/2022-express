The Labour leader will on Monday signal that Labour is willing to fight Boris Johnson over his Brexit legacy at the next election, setting out a five-point plan to tackle the economic pain caused by Britain’s divorce from the European Union. He will claim that Labour can “make Brexit work”, arguing that Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal has left the country “stuck” with stagnating wages and growth and crippled public services. In a speech, Sir Keir is expected to say: “They have created a hulking ‘fatberg’ of red tape.” He will then compare Brexit to the “wet wipe island” found in the river Thames. “It is hampering the flow of British business — we will break that barrier down.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
