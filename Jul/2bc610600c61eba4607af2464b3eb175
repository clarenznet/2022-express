Jane Fonda, 84, was spotted in Rome, Italy, yesterday as she continued to work on her latest movie, Book Club 2. The Hollywood actress was pictured hopping off a police helicopter in the middle of a field while filming scenes for the new film. The actress looks very different from her usual self, as she rocked dyed chestnut hair, featuring platinum silver streaks. The upcoming movie stars Jane along with Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen. Book Club 2 follows four best friends as they take their book club to Italy for a fun girls trip, but not all runs smoothly for the pals.
