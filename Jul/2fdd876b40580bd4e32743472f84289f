Penny Mordaunt addressed the Commons during International Trade questions after returning to her position in Government following her elimination from the Tory leadership contest. The former candidate took aim at her boss, International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who sat beside her in a brutal pushback against comments about her ethics. Ms Trevelyan had sided with Lord Frost who critiqued Ms Mordaunt's leadership campaign negatively, claiming she struggled to meet the requirement to become Prime Minister and often appeared "unprepared" about the job.
