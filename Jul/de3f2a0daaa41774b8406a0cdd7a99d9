Harry and Meghan Markle introduced their daughter to her namesake great-grandmother when they travelled to Britain for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations last month. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly wanted to bring a photographer with them to the meeting but the Queen turned down the request. Royal expert Camilla Tominey said Harry is understood to have "expressed a desire" for an official snap of the pair in the future. Writing for the Telegraph, Ms Tominey said: "The couple had hoped to bring their own photographer to capture the first meeting between the sovereign, whose family nickname is Lilibet, and her great-granddaughter. "However, the Queen personally intervened to prevent an official image being taken, apparently advising the couple that she had a bloodshot eye and did not want to feature in any pictures for public consumption. "It came after aides expressed fears that publicising a private meeting could set a dangerous precedent, not least if any photographs were shared with US television networks or Netflix, with whom the couple have signed a multi-million dollar contract. "The Duke is thought to have expressed a desire to get an official photograph of the two Lilibets together at some point in the future." The Sussexes reportedly visited the Queen just after arriving in the UK the day before Trooping the Colour, which marked the start of the bank holiday weekend. Harry and Meghan returned to Britain with their children Archie, three, and Lili, one, for the first time since Megxit for the historic Platinum Jubilee. It was the first time Lili, who was born in California, had met her great-grandmother, who she is named after.
