Jennifer Lopez flaunted her incredibleÂ curves yesterday as she stepped out at a dance studio in Los Angeles, California. The hitmaker, 52, flashed her washboard abs as she donned a t-shirt tied above her navel. She paired her top with a patterned pair of leggings which highlighted her peachy rear as she carried a Birkin bag. J.Lo accessorised with a large pair of black sunglasses and wore her brown locks in a knot on top of her head. It comes as Jenny and Ben married in an intimate ceremony in Las Vegas over the weekend, confirming their nuptials with snaps on social media.
