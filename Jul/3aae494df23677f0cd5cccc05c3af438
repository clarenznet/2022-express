All young people are given the chance to go to school in the UK, including anyone arriving in the UK from Ukraine. The Government believes that the best place for all children is in school. So going to school is also vital to help kids integrate into the UK way of life. It does help if your child speaks English, but it's not essential as there are specialist resources available to help young people learn to speak English. Some schools have English as an Additional Language (EAL) Co-ordinators, who help to integrate kids that don't speak English. There are also some schools that are specifically designed for students that only speak Ukrainian. For example, London has St Mary's Ukrainian School, and Manchester has the Manchester Ukrainian Saturday School. Each local council has different ways to apply for a school place. The best thing to do is to speak to your local council's school admission team. They'll help to provide information on local schools, as well as which ones have vacancies. Sadly, the most popular schools will likely be full when you're applying, so your options might be limited. In the UK, most children start school when they're five years old, with the school year starting in September. They'll remain in 'primary school' for the first six years of education, before moving to 'secondary school'. Secondary school pupils range from 11 to 16 years old, and will include GCSEs. Your children will start learning their GCSE's in Year 9, when they're 14 years old.
