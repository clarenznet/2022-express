Modern Family's Sofia Vergara, who has just celebrated her 50th birthday this month, invited fans to catch a scarcely seen glimpse at how she looked when she was just 14 years old. The America's Got Talent judge captioned her pic: "Barranquilla the 80â€™s" and hashtagged #14yrsold. The Colombian actress, model and TV star has packed her Instagram page with more than 5,000 photos over the years, and was showered with praise for this one by her 26.2 million followers. "You looked like THIS at 14? please you were already so stunning," @laura.sivazlian exclaimed. As followers continued to admiringly label her "outrageously beautiful", @kirkmollico insisted that she is "hotter now than then". With a seemingly ageless complexion despite entering her sixth decade, it seems that the internet agrees - but her throwback snap nevertheless caused delight in those who viewed it.
