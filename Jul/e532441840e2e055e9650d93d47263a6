Dan Walker, 45, looked very dapper as he posed at Solent University to receive an Honorary Doctorate. The former BBC Breakfast presenter received a Doctorate in media for his services to the industry. In view of 770,400 Twitter followers, he wrote proudly: "Thank you so much to @SolentUni for inviting me today to receive an Honorary Doctorateâ€¦ I am truly humbled. "It was lovely to be back at the university & to meet so many people. "All the best to all those graduating who have to wear hats and cloaks in 30 degree heat."
