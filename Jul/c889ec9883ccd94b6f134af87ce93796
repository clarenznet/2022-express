Locals had to push the grey motor off Perranporth beach in Cornwall on Saturday evening after the group got into difficulty. Signs state cars, other than emergency service vehicles and restaurant delivery vans, aren't allowed on the sand. Josh Munyard, who witnessed the hapless driver labour to get free, said: "The chap went forward and got stuck. He then tried to dig himself out and just failed for a few times. "He managed to dig his car out eventually and got pushed out by a group of about eight people." Josh took a photograph, seen by Cornwall Live, which shows a group desperately trying to prise the BMW out of the sand. The image has been shared widely on social media, to which locals have shared their amusement.  One woman posted on Facebook: "Why? It clearly says, no beach access for vehicles!" Another added: "Some people think those signs don’t apply to them." A third said: "They drove up in front of me about 6.30pm when I went to pack down at some speed and I knew they would be stuck. They came to an abrupt halt that's for sure. It happens all the time! Pretty much daily this time of year." One woman posted: "I love the two stood in front hands on hips." A driver was slammed in May after getting a saloon car stranded on the sand at nearby Portreath. Speaking at the time, a spokesman for Portreath coastguard team said "We were tasked this morning to reports of a car stuck on the beach at Portreath. On arrival we confirmed that a car had become stuck in the sand after they had driven onto the beach last night in the dark. "After their decision to camp overnight, a member of the public reported this on their morning walk. After attempting to free the vehicle with the police it was then decided to put the owner in contact with a local farmer, who gave up their time to come a retrieve the vehicle from the beach."
