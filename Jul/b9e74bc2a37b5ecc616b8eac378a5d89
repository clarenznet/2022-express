The duo were the powerhouses behind the legendary band that started in the Sixties but clashed ­regularly on and off stage for years. Now, in his book Living On A Thin Line, Dave criticises Ray heavily, calling him a “vampire.” He describes his brother as a “megalomaniac feeding his narcissism”, adding: “It was unnerving to see how quickly ­someone could disappear up their own a***.” After suffering a stroke in 2004, Dave went to stay with Ray for two weeks to aid his recovery, but says it “became a nightmare.” Dave, 75, said: “My brother is very talented and gifted, and I don’t want to be mean so soon, but I sometimes feel he’s like a vampire – the way he draws so much energy from people." “The way he was absorbing my energy during those two weeks. Eventually, I thought, I love you, but really I don’t have much to give at the moment.” Ray and Dave were joined by Pete Quaife and Mick Avory in the original Kinks line-up.
