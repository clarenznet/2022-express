Kim Rackley, 30, found a lump in early pregnancy but put it down to changes in her body and didn't think much more of it. But three months later when she realised the lump was still there, the expectant mum, from Gillingham, Kent, started to worry.  Launching a fundraiser on GoFundMe, Chloe from Chatham, South East England, is aiming to raise £3000 to "Help Kim Pay The Bills During Chemo." Describing Kim's cancer diagnosis, Chloe said: "In a matter of days Kim had gone from excitedly awaiting the arrival of Leo to finding out she has cancer and having a baby that was in NICU.       "A lot has changed over the last year but a lot has stayed the same. I've still got amazing friends and family who will do anything for me. I've met a load of new absolutely amazing people who have stood by my side despite only knowing me for a number of months. "I've watched my boy go from struggling to breathe in the NICU and battling with a milk allergy to being a happy, healthy, albeit a bit gobby, beautiful boy. And through it all I've had Kris by my side to pick me up each time I've got down."I honestly wouldn't be where I am now without the support of those closest to me."
