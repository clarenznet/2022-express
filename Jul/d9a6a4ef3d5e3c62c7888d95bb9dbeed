Cliff Richard, 81, looked a mere fraction of his age as he stepped out again at this year's SW19 championships to see the semi-finalists battle it out. He wore a pastel peach suit with a hint of a grey hue, and paired it with a pale blue shirt underneath. However most noticeable of all was the return of the small red rose he has been pinning to his jacket, a trademark for him at this year's tournament. Earlier in the week he wowed the crowds in a bright multicoloured snakeskin jacket, and even performed a spot of impromptu singing from the audience.
