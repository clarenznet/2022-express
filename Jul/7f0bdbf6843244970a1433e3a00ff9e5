The journalist felt the situation was "heartbreaking on one level" and "very annoying on another".She continued: “The Queen was very, very clear when he left that you can’t use your royal contacts to make money and that’s what they’ve been doing and that’s completely wrong.“So the titles should be taken away but the Queen is 96, she loves Harry and at her time of life she wants things to be quiet, she doesn’t want an upheaval.“And also I think that they are all worried about what else he could say that would be even worse than he said so far."
