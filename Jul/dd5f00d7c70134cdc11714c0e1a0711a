Amber Heard’s insurance company has reportedly filed a lawsuit in federal court against the actress claiming that they are not liable to pay part of the $8 million damages owed to her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. In a policy written in 2019, New York Marine and General Insurance Co. stated it would pay up to $1m.However, in the suit filed on Friday, the company claims that it is not obligated to cover a portion of the damages because Ms Heard “wilfully” defamed Mr Depp.This is because the policy was filed in California where the law states that an insurer does not need to pay if the policy holder committed “wilful” misconduct.The company said in its filing: “An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Heard, on the other hand, with regard to the duties and obligations owed between Plaintiff and Heard under the Policy with respect to indemnity.
