Deputy Commons leader Peter Bone announced the time available to consider the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill will be extended by an hour to enable it to complete the remaining stages. MPs were planning to spend up to six hours on Wednesday finishing the Bill's committee stage, which involves line-by-line scrutiny, but Mr Bone said time will be added on to allow the Bill to receive a third reading, clearing the way for it to be sent to the House of Lords. Mr Bone, raising a point of order following the conclusion of the Bill's second day of committee stage, told MPs: "Given the progress of the committee of the whole House we will now take the Third Reading of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill tomorrow. "A supplementary programme motion will be tabled tonight to provide for an extra hour of debate tomorrow." Boris Johnson's Government said the measures to remove checks on goods and animal and plant products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are necessary to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and peace and stability. The plans have been widely criticised by the EU, who have threatened legal action, while Tory former Prime Minister Theresa May has questioned the legality of the Bill. THIS LIVE HAS NOW CLOSED
