Amanda Holden, 51, has posted a serene-looking video to Instagram rom her sun-soaked Sicily trip. The Britain’s Got Talent star stood on a jetty, her hair wet from the sea, while the wind billowed through her stunning pale blue beach dress. The gown featured a cut out section at the back, and gave Amanda’s fans a glimpse of her toned legs. Amanda has been wowing fans with her sizzling holiday snaps, though she inadvertently sparked a backlash when she revealed she had flown via a private jet. She posted a photo of the environmentally unfriendly transport, explaining she was off to meet with Alan Carr in Italy. But her followers were less than impressed, with several pointing out how much CO2 the planes emit.
