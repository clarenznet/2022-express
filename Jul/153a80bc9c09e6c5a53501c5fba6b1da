The summer transfer window is well and truly heating up, with a number of Premier League clubs working hard to land reinforcements before the new campaign gets underway. The likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham are said to be in the market to improve their ranks and will be looking to accelerate their efforts to rubber-stamp more incomings and outgoings over the coming days. United are said to have finally agreed a fee with Barcelona for the services of Frenkie de Jong, but the Dutchman is yet to settle on personal terms with the Red Devils despite weeks of protracted negotiations. Erik ten Hag will also be hoping to snap up Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez in the not-too-distant future, with the 24-year-old also a key target for those in command at Old Trafford. Chelsea, meanwhile, are preparing to announce Kalidou Koulibaly as their second summer signing after the capture of Raheem Sterling earlier this week. The Napoli stalwart completed a medical in London on Thursday and is now expected to fly out to LA to link up with his new Blues team-mates for the very first time.
