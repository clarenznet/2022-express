As Naga Munchetty asked Matt Tebbutt what was coming up on his BBC cooking show Saturday Kitchen, the BBC Breakfast host couldn't help but mock his appearance. During the segment, Naga also poked fun at the fact, that Matt's show had been "shoved over" from BBC One to BBC Two due to the Commonwealth Games coverage. Naga began: "We're with you until half nine today because the Commonwealth Games are on, so we're making way for those obviously. "And Saturday kitchen has been shoved over to another kitchen on BBC Two this morning. Matt, good morning to you." "Good morning," Matt replied before referencing Naga's dig: "Shoved over..." "That's the technical term," the host replied before adding: "i can show you what that looks like the next time we meet."
