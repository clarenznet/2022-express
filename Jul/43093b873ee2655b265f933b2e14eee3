Carol Kirkwood, 60, wowed on Monday’s BBC Breakfast wearing a very low-cut floral dress. The yellow midi dress featured puff sleeves and a blue floral pattern. She presented the weather from outdoors in Central London and issued a warning about the soaring temperatures. She said: “It’s not just the UK temperature heat record that is likely to be broken in the next couple of days. Individual ones are as well for Scotland, England and Wales. “Although today is going to be hot, tomorrow will be hotter.” Carol then took to Twitter and told her followers that she has never seen temperatures like this in her entire career. She said: "In all my years presenting the weather I have never before mentioned a temperature of 40 Celsius anywhere in the UK. This is unprecedented heat."
