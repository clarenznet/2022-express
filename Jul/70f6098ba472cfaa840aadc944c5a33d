The locksmith, from East Sussex, said: “Reputation is crucial in the trade industry, and rogue trades operating in this environment gives our industry a bad name. “It’s important homeowners understand just how difficult rogue trades are to spot, and why it is so important to carry out checks to make sure your work is being carried out by a suitable skilled and qualified trustworthy trade.” Mike Fairman, CEO at Checkatrade, added: “High demand for tradespeople, the rising cost of living, and the ongoing raw materials shortage, have placed a huge amount of pressure on the home improvement industry, creating the ideal environment for rogue trades to step in and take advantage. “On the surface it’s impossible to tell the cowboys from the good guys – and you don’t want to risk finding out as a result of a botched job. “The best way to avoid rogue trades is to only hire suitably skilled and qualified workers.
