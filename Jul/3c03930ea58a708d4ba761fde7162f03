It comes as the government push forward with plans to reform pre-Brexit rules that govern the UK's insurance industry. Whitehall plans to free up £90billion of investment by reducing the amount insurers must hold to protect themselves from bankruptcy.  But Sam Woods, head of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said on Friday that the industry reaction to his team’s proposals has been “largely negative”. The Treasury gave the PRA – which falls under the Bank of England – permission to slash red tape following Brexit. Sam Woods, CEO of the PRA, said the UK "must avoid a regulatory race to the bottom” to make sure consumers and pensioners are not at risk. He added: "There are areas where the regulation we have inherited from the EU is too strong for the UK, and others where it is too weak. We should be willing to make changes in both directions where the evidence supports it." Follow below for live updates...
