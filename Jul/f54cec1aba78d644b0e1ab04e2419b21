Rita Ora, 31, stunned as she attended Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week in some eye-popping ensembles. Wanting to impress, the singer had three outfit changes during the day, with two of her dress choices posing a risk of a serious wardrobe malfunction. Earlier in the day, Rita flashed her toned pins in a black mini dress. However, the dress featured a zipped thigh-high split, risking a flashing incident. Later on, she changed into a silver strapless crop top with embellished detail. The tight-fitted look showed off the singer's ample assets, as she spilled out of the skimpy top. Rita also wore a pair of white trousers which featured a matching shimmering diamond embellishment.
