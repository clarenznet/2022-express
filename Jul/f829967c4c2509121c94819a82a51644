Tunisian star Ons Jabeur made history today by becoming the first Arab woman to reach the final of a Grand Slam. The 27-year-old beat German Tatjana Maria in three sets in their Wimbledon semi-final clash on Centre Court, with Jabeur now to take on either Simon Halep or Elena Rybakina on Saturday in her pursuit of winning a maiden Major title. Speaking on-court afterwards, Jabeur said: "I don't know what to say. It's a dream come true after years of work and sacrifice. I'll continue for one more match now. It was difficult running for Maria's balls! She has to make me a BBQ to make up for all the running. "I wanted to share the moment with her because she's such an inspiration for so many players, coming back after having two babies. I don't know how she did it. "Physically she is a beast, she doesn't give up any points and she made me run. I thought she'd get tired but she didn't, even with drop shots. "Her touch, her serve, everything is impressive and I love to see her like this. But let's not play again! "I'm a proud Tunisian woman standing here today. I know they're going crazy there right now and I try to inspire as much as I can. I want to see more African players on tour and I want to share this experience with them."
