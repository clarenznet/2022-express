Bradley Cooper has fully embraced his role as conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein as he's spotted filming new film, Maestro. The actor, 47, was seen filming the upcoming movie in Central Park, New York. Bradley looked unrecognisable as he sported a thick head of grey hair and thick, bushy eyebrows. He cut a smart figure in a beige suit which was matched to a light pink shirt and burgundy tie. The Hollywood star was seen strolling through the park with a cigarette on his lips as he got into character.
