Buckingham Palace's decision to bury a report into allegations of bullying by the Duchess of Sussex has been taken to avoid antagonising Harry and Meghan, according to the Daily Mail’s Royal Editor Rebecca English. She noted that the Firm took the decision "because they don’t want to poke the bear that is Harry and Meghan" and were prepared to take the bad press on the chin "to keep the peace with them". Speaking on Palace Confidential, Daily Mail Diary Editor Richard Eden added: "It’s the wrong move, I think it’s terrible for everyone that’s been left hanging. You could argue that it’s very unfair to Meghan. What worries me greatly is it just seems like the Palace are falling over themselves not to upset Harry and Meghan. They seem desperate not to upset them and I think that’s a mistake." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
