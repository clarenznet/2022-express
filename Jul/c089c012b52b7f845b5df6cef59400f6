Newcastle United have been linked with a shock move for a striker dubbed the 'next Erling Haaland'. The Magpies are in the market for a new forward after a deal for French wonderkid Hugo Ekitike fell through, with the teenager opting to move to Paris St Germain instead.  But now Red Bull Salzburg forward Benjamin Sesko has become the latest player to be linked with a move to Newcastle, with his agent Elvis Basanovic spotted on Tyneside. Basanovic posted on his Instagram story a picture of Newcastle's Quayside. Sesko, 19, has made a name for himself already in Austria. The Slovenian international struck 10 times in 36 games for Salzburg last season in a breakthrough campaign, having been on loan at second division FC Liefering, Red Bull's feeder club, where he netted 21 times in 29 appearances.
