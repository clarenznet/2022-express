 Amanda Holden, 51, has taken to Instagram in shots of herself wearing a shirt-style dress before slipping into a busty lemon print number for fans to admire.  It comes as the Britain's Got Talent judge attended the reception for the 160th Anniversary of the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home at Clarence House today in the fruit-printed number.  On her social media account, the actress showcased her impressive pins in a half-shirt, half-dress style outfit as she posed sternly with her hands on her hips and gazed into the distance in view of her 1.8 million followers.  The star wore brown leather heels to complete her look, and accessorised with red nails.  AmandaÂ kept the nails for the anniversary celebrations which she later attended, but switched out the shoes for pointed yellow heels and the long white lemon print dress.  The new look was finished off with silver bangles and a gold necklace.
