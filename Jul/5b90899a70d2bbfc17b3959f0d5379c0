Christine McGuinness, 34, appeared to be deep in thought while out and about in Cheshire yesterday as she stepped out of her car alone. It comes after the model revealed that her and husband Paddy McGuinness' marriage of 11 years is going through a rocky period.  After Christine was spotted looking downcast, the Top Gear host teased he would give his family “cuddles” after returning home to the UK following a work trip abroad.  Paddy, 48, has been out in Thailand for the last few days as he films for Top Gear alongside co-presenter Chris Harris, 47.  Announcing his homecoming on Sunday on Instagram, the star shared a snap of himself travelling back from Thailand on a plane.  Christine spoke about her emotional state to The Sun last week.  She said: "What I might have put up with in the past, I probably wouldn’t put up with now, and the same for him."  The mum-of-three added: “I can't lie, we're having a very, very difficult time."
