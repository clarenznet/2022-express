Amanda Holden, 51, shares outfit pictures everyday with her fans prior to her Heart Radio show, and she hasn't taken a break today, despite being away in Italy. As she enjoys the sun of Sicily, Amanda has made sure not to disappoint as she shares her stunning holiday outfits. The Britain's Got Talent judge took to Instagram this morning to share a TikTok video she had made from the beach. The video shows the presenter walking across the beach, before stripping down to her bikini, with the video repeating: "This is perfect." Amanda stunned in a yellow kaftan, before the shot jumped to her in a tiny yellow bikini in the sea. Her gym-honed figure was on full display, with the image then cutting to her laying on a sunbed, enjoying the holiday season. Telling her 1.8 million followers about the post, she said: "The weather in Sicily #PerfectPerfectPerfect #Sicily #TheItalianJob."
