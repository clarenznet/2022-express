Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled gas conglomerate, has warned that it will slash gas deliveries travelling to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 33 million cubic metres from July 27. The energy giant has blamed this on the "technical condition" of a gas turbine engine, as well as another issue which came about amid the annual maintenance work being carried out on Nord Stream 1. The company said in a statement: "Due to the end of time between overhauls before overhaul (in accordance with the instructions of Rostekhnador and taking into account the technical condition of the engine), Gazprom stops the operation of another Seimens gas turbine engine at the Portovaya CS."  Gazprom added: "The daily output of the Portovaya CS from 07:00 Moscow time on July 27 will be 33 million cubic metres per day." This marks a 20 percent decline in capacity, according to the BBC's Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill. Jessica Parker, the Brussels Correspondent for BBC News, tweeted: "Energy ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the EU's emergency gas saving plan. "This kind of development is exactly what the Commission has been concerned about." And this is not the first time that Russia has sparked fears over slashed supplies, with Gazprom having made a similar move last month, also blaming this on the repair of pipeline infrastructure.   The move put Berlin on red alert, with Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck stressing the situation was “serious” and adding that “every kilowatt hour helps in this situation” as fears of an emergency gas rationing plan looked to be on the cards. But Germany was not the only country impacted by the plummeting supplies, with Italy, Slovakia and Austria (to name a few) also feeling the pinch of the June cut. This is a breaking story.
