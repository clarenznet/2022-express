Coleen Nolan, 57, has split from her boyfriend Michael Jones, 58, after one year of dating. The Loose Women panellist met supermarket worker Michael on Tinder, but they are now said to have “quietly” parted ways. After the couple’s six-hour-long first date in 2021, they were inseparable for some time and were spotted hand in hand on a shopping trip in Cheshire back in April. Coleen was previously married to EastEnders star Shane Richie. Express.co.uk has contacted a representative for Coleen for comment. A source told The Sun: “Coleen and Michael were together for just over a year and while they were happy at first, the spark fizzled out in the end. “They quietly broke up in April but have stayed close. She is looking forward to the future and possibly meeting someone new but there is no rush. “Coleen enjoys the single life and has said she’ll soon be back online dating trying to find her dream match.” A spokesperson for Coleen added: “Coleen and Michael are no longer together but remain great friends and are on good terms.”
