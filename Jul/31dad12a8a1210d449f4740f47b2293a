The Sledgehammer singer, who performed in his old band Genesis’ final gig in March, revealed his son got him to be more healthy. Gabriel said: “He is studying bio-medicine and he keeps educating me about longevity.“He has told me that intermittent fasting is good, not eating between dinner and midday.“He told me to eat more beans but we know the consequences of that. Maybe I’ll float a little easier. I used to think this stuff was ridiculous but I am discovering more.”
