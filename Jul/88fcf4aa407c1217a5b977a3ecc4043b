Ambulance crews were called to Thorpes Road, near Shipley Country Park in Heanor, on the afternoon of June 18 following reports of a boy suffering injuries. Despite efforts to heal the child, he sadly died later that day. An investigation by Derbyshire Police has now resulted in the arrest of a 41-year-old man. Michael Harrison, from Nottingham, has been charged with murder. He is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court today. Officers revealed that Harrison has also been charged with engaging in coercive and controlling behaviour. Derbyshire Police said in a statement: “Officers from Derbyshire Constabulary and the East Midlands major crime unit will be continuing with their inquiries and will remain in the area over next few days. “Anyone with information is encouraged to speak to them.” Officers have asked members of the public to come forward if they spot a white Vauxhall Combo van which is related to their inquiries. This, they noted, may be displaying one of three registrations: FL54 JBJ, FL54 JDJ or FG57 FTO.
