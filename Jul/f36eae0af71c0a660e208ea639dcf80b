Declan Donnelly's baby son Jack was born just days ago, but his joy has been marred by the tragic death of his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, who was laid to rest today. The devoted Catholic priest died of a mystery illness aged 55, leaving Declan bereft. The sad news came very soon after he celebrated his 30 year anniversary of service to the priesthood. â€œI am heartbroken to tell you that my darling brother Fr Dermott, sadly passed away," Dec told the world at the time. The popular TV host added: "We are all beyond devastated." Today, the star's mouth was downturned as, clad in a black suit, he helped carry his beloved brother's coffin into the funeral service.
