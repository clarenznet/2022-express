Harley, a miniature Jack Russell was less than two years old when he was killed. The incident occurred on Friday afternoon while Harley was out on a walk with his owner in Tameside, Greater Manchester. The woman was walking through Silver Springs, near Tameside Hospital, in Ashton-under-Lyne. A boxer-type dog initially began to attack the Jack Russell terrier. It then bit Harley's owner on the ear and hand when she attempted to intervene. The woman was rushed to the hospital by a passerby, while Harley was taken to a veterinary hospital where he sadly died. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News about the death of their dog, the woman's husband said: "We are absolutely heartbroken, we are devastated. He was our life. "He went to the vets but there was nothing they could do, he was already gone. "We got him when he was the littlest pup. "He would have been two years old in September. "We're just devastated, we don't know what to do.

"Everywhere we look now there is dog stuff and no dog. "Unless you've had a dog it's hard to explain, but you can't bear it." He hit out at "irresponsible" dog owners, saying: "That dog could have killed a child. "I'm just glad it wasn't my daughter that was walking Harley at the time. "You always get these incidents where things happen with big dogs, but it's irresponsible owners. "If this woman had the dog on a lead this would never have happened." He added: "It just came straight out of nowhere. It picked my dog up like it was a rat and it just bit him to death. "My wife was screaming. This woman just stood there, she didn't do anything, she didn't help. "She ran off and the dog followed her." The incident has been reported to Greater Manchester Police.
