Vadim Zimin, a retired Russian security officer, is in intensive care after being found "in a pool of blood" by his brother. The Kyiv Post reported that the 53-year-old retired FSB colonel is in intensive care after allegedly sustaining a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Mr Zimin was known to carry Putin's nuclear football - known as a Cheget in Russia - which functions as a mobile defence hub with codes inside that would allow Putin to order a nuclear attack. The Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reports Mr Zimin was detained in December on suspicion that he was taking bribes from a businessman. He was reportedly under house arrest during an ongoing criminal investigation - for which he denies any wrongdoing - at the time of the shooting incident. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
