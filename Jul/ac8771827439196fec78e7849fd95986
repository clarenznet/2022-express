Serena Williams, 40, looked chic in a pink sheer dress as she made a stellar appearance at the premiere of Thor: Love and Thunder in London. The sports icon seemed eager to forget her first-round defeat by Harmony Tan at Wimbledon 2022 last week, as she enjoyed the glamorous event. The tennis legend was accompanied by her husband Alexis Ohanian, who looked dapper in a blue blazer and black trousers. Serena wowed fans in a flowy pink dress that featured a black necktie, complete with a ruffled neckline. She paired the ethereal gown with some gold strappy heels and opted for an earthy-toned makeup palette to compliment her wavy honey blonde hair.
