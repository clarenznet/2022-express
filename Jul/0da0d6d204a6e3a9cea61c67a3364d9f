Despite leaving the bloc in 2020, four years after the referendum, Brexit is still fresh in the mind of voters across the UK as its impact on the UK begins to take full effect. The Northern Ireland protocol, which was negotiated during the transition period, has proved to be one of the most contentious issues in Westminster and Northern Ireland since the UK departed. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss formally began the process of unilaterally changing the protocol’s terms - a move that has enraged EU negotiators who have refused to budge on the UK’s demands. So far, Jeremy Hunt is the only leadership contender to announce he would continue with the controversial legislation if he is chosen to be the next Prime Minister - but with Ms Truss also standing for the top spot, it’s likely she would finish what she started earlier this year. This leadership election could be fought with Brexit on the back foot, with issues like tax and the cost of living crisis becoming the forefront of the current hoard of candidates’ campaigns. So, do you think Brexit is safe in the hands of anyone but Boris Johnson? Which candidate would you trust to see through Brexit promises and make changes to the Northern Ireland protocol?
