Perez Hilton said that across the pond the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are seen as celebrities rather than members of the Royal Family. It comes as the former Suits actress and the Queen’s grandson are living in California after quitting royal duties in 2020. Mr Hilton told LA-based royal commentator Kinsey Schofield’s To Di For Daily podcast: "You know, I’m not being a hater. “I am stating the facts. “In America, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are not royals to us. “They are celebrities. "And unfortunately, they’re boring celebrities." Meghan and Harry are living in the celebrity enclave of Montecito as they pursue new lives of personal and financial freedom across the pond. They have signed lucrative deals with streaming giants Netflix and Spotify as part of their new post-royal careers. They are reportedly filming an “at-home” docuseries as part of their Netflix deal. The Sussexes are said to have invited cameras into their home for the show. A Hollywood source previously told Page Six that Netflix was "getting its pound of flesh" from the couple with the series. Meanwhile, fans are looking forward to the release of Meghan’s first podcast series for Spotify. Archetypes which will focus on female stereotypes is due out later this year. Harry and Meghan recently returned to the UK with their children Archie and Lilibet for the first time since Megxit for the Platinum Jubilee. However, the couple kept a low profile during the celebrations and were absent from most events. There have been tensions between the Sussexes and senior royals in the wake of Megxit and the couple’s explosive Oprah Winfrey interview. Harry and Meghan made a series of bombshell claims in the sit-down chat with the US talk show host in March 2021. The Duke is also set to release his tell-all memoir later this year.
