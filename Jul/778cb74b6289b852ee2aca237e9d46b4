Inflation and wage levels will determine the rise in most payouts, the Department of Work and Pensions has said. All cash payments get an annual uprating which comes into effect each April, with a 3.1 percent increase in place for the current financial year. This was is in line with the September 2021 Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure. The previous increase was based on inflation, which has now reached 9.4 percent, meaning a big cash boost could be on the way for benefits recipients. Liberal Democrat MP Wendy Chamberlain asked ministers what factors will be taken into account when benefits are next reassessed. In a written parliamentary answer, DWP minister David Rutley said: "The Secretary of State must increase certain benefits by at least the increase in prices or earnings. “If she considers it appropriate, having regard to the national economic situation and any other matters which she considers relevant, she may increase others by such a percentage(s) as she thinks fit. "Her review will commence in the autumn and her decisions will be announced to Parliament in November in the normal way." The DWP has already said it will not bring in any widespread increases in the meantime to ease the cost of living crisis.

MPs asked Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey why the Government had decided to make these one-off cost-of-living payments instead of boosting the benefits system. She said: "We didn't want to necessarily change ratings beyond what we'd already done with my annual rating review. “Some of that would mean locking in, but we come back, frankly, to some of the challenges of our IT systems. "UC (Universal Credit) is far more agile, our legacy benefits aren't, and it's absolutely critical that people on both legacy benefits and UC were to get this payment. “We're confident that we'll get those payments out the door."
