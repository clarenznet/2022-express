The cause? It was not Brexit, a strike or even bad weather on the English Channel. No – it was that French border control officers failed to turn up for work as needed.  A mere handful sat in their booths, checking every passport in full detail. As the queues inevitably built up for miles, more border officers were eventually despatched. Yet in scenes worthy of a French farce, several hours later the French authorities said that the Channel Tunnel had delayed the border staff – a charge hotly rejected by Tunnel personnel. What is particularly maddening is that efforts to stop this very situation from happening had been going on for weeks prior. The Port of Dover, the Kent Resilience Forum and the Department for Transport had prepared carefully so that the summer getaway peak weekend went without a hitch. Just a couple of days ago, I met with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament for an update on how preparations were going to ensure the traffic kept moving through Kent, including dealings with the French.  Yet despite all the preparations, the French let us down badly. Ruining the start of family holidays is not something that can simply be dismissed with a Gallic shrug. France should apologise to Dover residents and the travellers who have suffered real misery on Kent’s roads, not make up excuses for letting everyone down. The summer getaway continues over this weekend and the French must now get a grip. They have to turn up for work for the whole weekend and ensure hard-working Britons can get that relaxing break they and their families want and deserve.
