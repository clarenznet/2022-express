The post on Reddit shows the neighbouring garden's banana trees, as well as the damage they have caused to the shared fence that runs between the two properties. The neighbour "won't take care of them", the Redditor claims. He also asked whether he should use a machete to chop down the trees. There have been a mixture of responses to the post, BirminghamLive reports. For instance, one user replied saying: "I love banana plants so much, reading everyone’s comments is breaking my heart. Please don’t put any kind of poison or flammable liquids onto the ground. Salt is a good idea. I use it to control bamboo. I’m not sure it even works but it makes me feel better every year to try something. You really do need to get in there and dig it out. "Since bananas are not trees, you don’t have to worry so much about the whole tree law business, so I would feel extra emboldened to hack away at it. I cut over the fence to help control my neighbor’s bamboo. One time she scolded me and I told her I would sue her for the damage from the bamboo and neither of us have discussed it since. "Sometimes I just take the saws all along the bottom of the fence line, right into the soil." A second said: "I can relate. My neighbors have a tree that grew, jacking up my fence. They could have cut it down when it was 2" thick but they didn't care. Recently they put up a new fence and actually had the b**** to ask me to pay half the cost to cut it down. I didn't and the tree is still there; they just didn't do that part of the fence."    According to the government's website, when it comes to disputes like this, people should always try and work them out with their neighbours first. However, people also have the right to trim branches or roots that cross into your property from a neighbour’s property or a public road. You can only trim up to the property boundary, though. If you do more than this, your neighbour could take you to court for damaging their property.
