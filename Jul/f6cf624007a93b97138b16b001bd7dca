Keeping dogs hydrated and cool during heatwaves is absolutely vital. With temperatures soaring above 30C, our beloved pets are more at risk than ever. Many UK dog owners have even gone out to buy expensive cooling pads or paddling pools. However, experts say a 70p misting spray bottle filled with icy-cold water is all you need to make sure your dog is nice and healthy during the intense heat. A spokeswoman from retail company Tap Warehouse said: “Keep your pets cool with a spray bottle filled with cold water and gently spray over their body and feet. “This will give a cooling effect and relax your pets as some can get distressed when they overheat. “Better yet, reusable spray bottles can be bought for just 70p from The Range.” There are a few other tricks concerned owners can pull to help their pups. These include adding ice cubes to dog’s water bowls, or even just giving them one or two to chew on. Owners can also buy freezable toys which will help keep your dog cool while helping with teething.
