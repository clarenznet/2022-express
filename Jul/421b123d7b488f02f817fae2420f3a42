Anna Wintour, 72, wore an outfit every bit as uncompromisingly elegant as onlookers might have expected as she strode into Wimbledon to catch some action on the centre court. The American Vogue editor stepped out in an all-white outfit which was anything but ordinary. Her long dress was patterned with trees, while her equally long, almost floor-length white coat featured an embroidered floral pattern. The British-American journalist added an injection of colour to her outfit with a green clutch purse and a turquoise green jewelled necklace. She wore her hair in the trademark bob for which she is instantly recognisable, and accessorised further with embellished white boots and classic black sunglasses.
