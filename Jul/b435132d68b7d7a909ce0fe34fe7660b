 Former Gogglebox cast member Amy Tapper, 22, has taken to Instagram to show off her drastic weight loss as the star posed up a storm in her low-cut red swimsuit while on holiday. The reality TV star could be seen taking a well-earned break in a restaurant in Tel Aviv over the weekend.  It comes after Amy has lost over three stone over the course of the last few months.  The star's family, which includes dad Jonathan, brother Josh and mum Nikki, featured on Gogglebox for 11 seasons.  In a photo which was captioned with two cherry emojis, Amy was shining in her holiday outfit, which she completed with aviator sunglasses and beachy waves in her hair.  Professional skater Alex Murphy commented on the Gogglebox favourite's radiant smile, writing: "You star" accompanied with a love heart.
