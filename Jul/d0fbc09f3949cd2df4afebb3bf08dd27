Sophie Wessex, 57, honoured the late Duke of Edinburgh by planting a rose in his memory during the Royal Family's Holyrood Week visit to Scotland. The Countess of Wessex made the journey into Scotland alongside her husband Prince Edward, 58 and her 96-year-old mother-in-law, the Queen. However, the mother-of-two also paid a visit to Capability Scotland to celebrate the charity's 75th anniversary. The charity provides care, support and education for disabled children and adults across Scotland. In a post on the Royal Family Instagram account, an update revealed the Countess' tribute to the late Duke. It said: "The Countess of Wessex visited Capability Scotland's Riccarton Service to celebrate the charity's 75th anniversary, and plant a rose in memory of their former Patron, The Duke of Edinburgh."

According to the Royal Family website, Sophie's visit to Capability Scotland came on the same day the Queen met with the 51-year-old Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Sophie later joined her husband Edward for a garden party at the Queen's Edinburgh residence. They were joined by Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. A total of 6,000 guests had been invited to the event in recognition of their contribution to communities across Scotland.
