More than 95,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK after fleeing their homes since Russia launched its invasion in February. As of July 12, 155,600 Ukrainian visas have been issued, from 187,800 applications, including 45,900 family visas and 109,700 sponsorship scheme visas. By this point, 95,400 visa holders have arrived in the UK. But many more are still expected to make the journey, and more applications are forecast. In Lincolnshire, the Resettlement Partnership is now calling for more people to sign up and offer to host a family after more than 750 Ukrainian people had been housed. Richard Wright, leader of North Kesteven District Council, said the generosity of hosts in Lincolnshire had been "extremely heartening". Headed: "We want to offer them our sincere thanks in offering their guests such a warm welcome to our county." The partnership said it was keen to hear from people who had expressed an interest earlier in the scheme but were not matched with a refugee. "We recognise that circumstances change for both hosts and guests and our Homes for Ukraine team is on hand to answer any questions from those interested in supporting the scheme.” Hosts are given a monthly “thank you” payment of £350 and are asked to help support their lodger(s) with things like helping them register for a GP and open a bank account. Any Ukrainian national - or immediate family member - who lived in Ukraine before January 1, 2022 qualifies. Those granted visas can live and work in the UK for up to three years and will have access to healthcare, welfare and schools. They can also bring their pets.
