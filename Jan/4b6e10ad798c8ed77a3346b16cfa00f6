The Nationality and Borders Bill will introduce significant reforms to tackle illegal immigration andthis week it entered its first debate for Committee Stage in the House of Lords, taking us significantly closer to transforming the system into one that is fair and firm, that we can be proud of and that the British public has voted for. As Express readers know, this is in much need of repair. The system is overwhelmed and has been exploited for too long. These new laws will close many of the loopholes that are exploited by illegal migrants. We will introduce action to verify the ages of asylum-seekers, including age assessments, due to the risks that can be caused by adults posing as children.
