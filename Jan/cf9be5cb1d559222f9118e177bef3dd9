Westminster is obsessed about occasions on which cake may or may not have been consumed but families are gripped with anxiety about escalating prices and the consequences of higher taxes and energy bills. Meanwhile, the massing of Russian troops on Ukraine's border raises the terrifying prospect of the most serious armed conflict in Europe in decades. Yes, people must be held to account for flouting coronavirus regulations and it is right that top civil servant Sue Gray's report will be fully scrutinised.
