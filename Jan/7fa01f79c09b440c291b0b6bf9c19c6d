Even dafter is the accusation that Lulu Lytle, the interior designer who refurbished the No.10 flat, was invited to the birthday cake presentation when she, poor woman, thought she was simply keeping an appointment with Boris to discuss the curtains. And all the time behind this giddy madness, horrible political realities are piling up fast – Russia’s on the point of invading Ukraine, the cost of living is soaring and we’re facing a major tax hike. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns, and you can be sure that if Boris possessed a violin that, too, would be part of the case against our premier party animal. I get it, of course. All this spite is because it’s personal, one of those rare occasions when politics reaches deep into our lives. For two years Covid rules made by our governing class have twisted our daily existence into a fear-fuelled nightmare, denying ourselves not only birthday celebrations but weddings, Christmas family gatherings and, most traumatic of all, the funerals of those we love. Many have been warned by police, even fined, for far more innocent meetings than boozy garden parties at swish addresses. So of course we’re angry when we’re told about posh people who seemed impervious to lockdown’s puritanism, who partied like there was no tomorrow while the rest of us thought that Armageddon really had arrived.

Boris has no idea how to conduct himself as Prime Minister, he’s deceitful, chaotic, shambolic and undignified. But this obsession with cake and wine is as unseemly as his behaviour. Let the ballot box decide. Two horrible years of fear and devastating illness are over. For the sake of our mental health, can’t we let it go?
