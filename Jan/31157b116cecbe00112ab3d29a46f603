She first visited with her dad Harry Lucas, who was the owners’ accountant. And since the end of the Second World War, Anne has spent £20,000 staying at three-star Colwall Park in Malvern, Worcs, often at Christmas and Easter. Staff there estimate she has clocked up 150 nights. Its current owners plan to mark her loyalty with a plaque, plus a tree in memory of her husband John, who died last June. Anne, who lives 62 miles away in Lichfield, Staffs, still visits – with daughter Emma, 53, and her pup Bronte. The gran of seven said: “We love going back there. It is my home away from home. “I associate it with when I was little, which brings back so many nice memories. The family who ran the hotel had a son the same age as me, so I always had a friend. The staff are amazing and always so helpful too.” Anne, 82, has already rebooked for this Easter. Matt Homans, the hotel general manager, said staff always look forward to welcoming her back.
