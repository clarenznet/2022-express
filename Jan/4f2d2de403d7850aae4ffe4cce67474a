To mark the anniversary, Boris Johnson today unveils a Brexit Freedoms Bill. It will concentrate on ridding the country of the remaining strands of EU bureaucracy so that we can move on anew. "Getting Brexit Done two years ago was a truly historic moment and the start of an exciting new chapter for our country," said the Prime Minister. Since 2020 the Government has been embroiled in fighting the pandemic. But trade relationships have been forged, global links made and plans laid.There's now an economic tailwind that bodes well, and despite post-Covid tribulations such as the cost of living crisis and inflation, British businesses can now build back better. No doubt the Bill will also help to sweep away some of the fuss about Partygate and fight off Mr Johnson's critics in his own party. Cynics will argue that there's a political calculus behind the Brexit Freedoms Bill, to bring freedom to Mr Johnson too. Let these arguments rage.We all need to get behind building a better future, and this Bill will help that effort. ----------------- EVERY one of us knows that a bad night's sleep can ruin your day.
