I arrived in this country as an eleven-year-old Kurdish boy, with hardly a word of English, and now sit in one of the great departments of Whitehall as a Cabinet Minister. That’s why I always say that this is the greatest country in the world.This country has given me everything, and it was the Conservative Party that took me under its wing.First as a young party member, then as an elected councillor in London, and now as the Member of Parliament for Shakespeare’s Straford-on-Avon and the Education Secretary in Her Majesty’s Government.I know that the Conservative party is at its best when it is united and focused on delivering for the country.And in our leader, Boris Johnson, we have a Prime Minister who is a great Conservative hero.He wrestled the London mayoralty away from Red Ken, helped win the Brexit referendum, stopped Jeremy Corbyn from getting the keys to No.10 Downing Street and finally got Brexit done where others failed. We have now regained control of our destiny as an independent United Kingdom.And it’s worth recapping on some of the many achievements of the last few years.In my former role as Vaccines Minister, I worked closely with the PM as we used evidence, expertise, passion and commitment to deliver a world leading vaccine programme, going after lots of different vaccine candidates and showing boldness and determination that allowed the UK got better results than our neighbours.Our freedom to move swiftly and without constraint to get jabs into arms convinced me even more that the decision to back Brexit was the right one.Thanks to the miracle of vaccines, unemployment is back to near pre-pandemic levels, and we are the first nation to begin the transition from pandemic to endemic. And he backed me completely as I threw the kitchen sink at making sure that schools reopened after the Christmas break. Boris has got the big calls right, which is why we are able to now lift all covid restrictions – including ditching face masks in the classroom, a personal priory for me as Education Secretary.The removal of restrictions is a huge victory for freedom and liberty.But let me absolutely clear.The reports of guidance not being followed in No.10 are deeply concerning.I know that many of you reading this column will have been angry and upset, as I was myself.While we must wait for the forthcoming investigation to detail what exactly happened, it was clear to me that the nation deserved an apology, and I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister offer one in Parliament from the despatch box. I know how sincerely felt it was, and how seriously the PM is taking this situation. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
