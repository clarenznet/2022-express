In other words Boris Johnson was getting on with the job of being Great Britain's Prime Minister - and doing it very well. But you may be excused for not knowing that this vital work was being carried out by a man whose passion is to do the right thing for this country. After all, you will have heard little about it on the BBC or other broadcasters. And certainly, if you bothered to tune in to the proceedings in Parliament, you would have heard nothing about these subjects from MPs, least of all the Labour Party. Instead we have been treated to a non-stop diatribe about parties in Downing Street which - it must be admitted - were unacceptable, but in many cases were heavy drinking at the end of the day by overworked and stressed-out staff. The people who occupy Britain's political bubble have not for the first time taken their eye off what is actually important. We could literally be at war some time this week ifVladimir Putin follows his current trajectory. But Sir Keir Starmer would still be talking about the corkage in government offices. Worse still,Tory MPs - who have Mr Johnson to thank for their political careers - will be wondering whether they should oust their leader. All the time they are playing into the hands of extremist Remainers such as Lords Adonis and Heseltine, who want to destroy Brexit and end Britain's newly-won freedom. It is time that Conservative MPs in particular, but also the wider body politic, grow up and start to focus on serious matters. Little wonder that Express readers have made their anger so plain on the Letters page of today's Sunday Express. Their frustration must be shared by much of the country.
