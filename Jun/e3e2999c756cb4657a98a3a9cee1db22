Al Pacino, 82, and Robert De Niro, 78, have appeared side by side as they attended The Godfather’s 50th anniversary celebration. The special tribute took place at the Tribeca Festival in New York City.  Leading man Al played the head of the Corleone family, Michael Corleone, and Robert De Niro portrayed the young version of his father, Vito Corleone, in the sequel.  The Tribeca Festival, an annual film festival co-founded by De Niro, screened a restoration of the film on Thursday night.  Dressed in all black, wearing a blazer, trousers, t-shirt, scarf and trainers, Al talked about his life as an actor leading up to the shoot for The Godfather and the aftermath.  He said  he "deeply honored" for all the praise and accolades placed on The Godfather, and that he was "so fortunate" to have landed the role of Michael Corleone, despite it taking him a "lifetime to move on and adapt".  Meanwhile, De Niro flashed several smiles while dressed casually in black pants with a dark blue blazer over a light blue top.
