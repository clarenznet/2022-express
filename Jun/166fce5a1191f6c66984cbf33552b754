PSN servers are currently down, leaving PS4 and PS5 owners unable to properly play games online. The PSN server status makes grim reading for fans, who have complained about not being able to access the PlayStation Network. Independent website Down Detector has received thousands of reports that PSN isn't working. The outage tracker monitors social mentions around certain topics to detect when services go down across the world. The Down Detector outage map shows that the PSN issues are affecting users in the UK and Europe, as well as parts of North America. Indeed, there are more than 10,000 reports of PSN server issues in North America, plus another 4,000+ reports in the UK. Interestingly, Sony is yet to acknowledge the issue, with the PSN Status page showing all services working normally. The PSN Support Twitter account is also yet to make a statement, so fingers crossed it's a minor outage. Express Online has successfully logged in to PSN on the PS5, despite receiving a message about servers being busy. The store page also loaded as normal. Users are encouraged to restart their device in order to get things back up and running. Other fans haven't been quite so lucky, and have complained about the server issues on social media. A selection of comments about the PSN server outage can be seen below... "Hey guys. PSN is down so I am currently unable to stream! I’ll keep an eye on things and hopefully it’ll be fixed quickly! Stay tuned!" "The notification I got said a maintenance break on the PSN network. Obviously firefighting an issue otherwise you would've given all your users a heads up wouldn't you?" "Might want to update your status to down clearly something is wrong yet the status say working fine." "Why is everybody freaking out. I remember when servers used to go down twice a week. They’re already back up." "If your PlayStation Network is down, reboot your console. It's let me back in."
