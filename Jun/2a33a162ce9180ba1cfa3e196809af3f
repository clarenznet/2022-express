The actress, who played serial killer Meena Jutla in the soap, beat fellow cast member Mark Charnock to the top gong after the Best Actor and Actress awards were axed. And Emmerdale was also crowned Best British Soap, seeing off competition from Coronation Street, EastEnders, Doctors and Hollyoaks. The soap, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this October, also clinched the Best Family Award for The Dingles and Best Dramatic Performance award for Mark’s portrayal of Marlon Dingle. Paige had also been nominated for the best villain and best storyline awards at the ceremony but lost out. Speaking about her experience on the show, she said: “At the time it was such a whirlwind, I was just trying to do my absolute best. I am such a perfectionist and now coming out of it I am so proud. “Playing Meena was the most fulfilling thing ever, no character compares to her." “We have put a lot of work into the past year. We are particularly proud of Mark Charnock who has smashed it – such a wonderful human being and also an incredible actor." Mark, 53, who had been nominated for best single episode following the “Marlon’s stroke” episode said: “It was challenging to film but only in a sense that we wanted to get it right." “The main thing is the response from people who have gone through it which has been fantastic.” The red carpet event held at London’s Hackney Empire returned after the previous two years were cancelled because of the pandemic. EastEnders won four awards, Coronation Street three, Hollyoaks two and Doctors one.
