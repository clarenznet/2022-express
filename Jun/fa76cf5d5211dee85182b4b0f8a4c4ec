Abbey Clancy, 36, looked incredible as she attended the unveiling of a mural in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in France last night. The model showed off her sensational figure in the red sheer bodycon dress, exposing her black bra and knickers set in the very see-through number. She accessorised with clear heels and a diamante necklace, which was also visible underneath the dress' sheer graphic print fabric. Abbey's signature blonde tresses were worn in a light wave, as she went for a simple make-up palette. Meanwhile, her husband, former footballer Peter Crouch, looked very dapper in a suit, accompanied with a white T-shirt underneath.
