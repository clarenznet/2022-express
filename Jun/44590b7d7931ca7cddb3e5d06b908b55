The last picture Dame Deborah James posted of herself on Instagram shows the mother-of-two beaming with pride as she raised £1m for a cancer charity. The brave star died on Tuesday, aged 40, while surrounded by her beloved family and friends, with tributes pouring in. The broadcaster leaves behind husband Sebastien and children Eloise, 12, and Hugo, 14. The final photo Deborah posted of herself on her Instagram showed her posing with a giant cheque after her clothing collection raised £1m for Cancer Research UK. The star smiled alongside InTheStyle bosses, as she celebrated the achievement. The post read: "WOW!! ONE MILLION POUNDS...I am honestly so overwhelmed we, through @inthestyle raised over £1,000,000 for @bowelbabefund for @cr_uk! All from sales of the ITS x Dame Deborah James collection and ‘Rebellious Hope’ T-shirts that I designed with @inthestyle. (One million, that’s just crazy)." Her final public outing saw her attend Royal Ascot on June 15 with her brother and his fiancée, beaming from her wheelchair in a glam polka dot dress. Sharing the photos of herself mingling with other celebs at the event, she wrote on Instagram afterwards: "Yesterday was really special as with a lot of effort and help I actually made it to @ascotracecourse once again. "I honestly have to pinch myself that I’ve been well enough each day to do something like this. Another favourite I’d had in mind and a fab milestone to say, 'Ain’t dead yet!'"
