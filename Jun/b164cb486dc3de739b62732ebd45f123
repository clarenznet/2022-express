It had an open collar and Sophie appeared to have undone the top button of the dress for this hot day. In keeping with the Royal Ascot dress code, the royal donned a hat. Her hat of choice was of the cartwheel variety. It was perfectly matched to the colour of her dress. The hat featured four huge blue roses. It also featured gathered material around the flowers which resembled leaves. As for jewellery, the Countess kept it simple. She opted for a diamond stud in each ear in the shape of a flower. The royal also wore a striking turquoise brooch. She opted for two dainty bracelets, one gold and one white. As for makeup, the Countess opted for a fresh, dewy look. She wore a pale pink lip and a sweep of blush.
