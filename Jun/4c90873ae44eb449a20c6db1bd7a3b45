Frankie Bridge, 33, has revealed how she cleverly treated herself to a hair mask without the aid of a shower cap today. The Loose Women star stripped off for a soak in her luxurious bath while posting her beauty hack to Instagram. On her Story, Frankie said: “Morning, um, I decided to do a hair mask this morning and then realised that I didn’t have a shower cap anymore. “So I decided to go for a sandwich bag. Um, it’s a look, for sure. I don’t know if it actually works or does what I think it’s doing. “It’s a little bit tight. Um, I thought that was quite inventive of me, if you will. “Also, side note, where it’s kind of filled up with air, kind of works as a pillow. “So if Dragons' Den wants to hit me up with my new invention. You know where to find me.”
