The youngster celebrated her own big day on Saturday as the rest of the world built up to the Queen’s platinum jubilee concert. Her Majesty - who was nicknamed Lilibet as a girl - posted a balloon emoji and message on her official Twitter account, saying: "Wishing Lilibet a very Happy 1st Birthday!" Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, hosted the get together at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, where they are staying with Lilibet and their son Archie, three, after flying in from California. Guests included Zara and Mike Tindall's children Mia, eight, Lena, three, and Lucas, one, and Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly's daughters Savannah, 11, and Isla, ten. Archie's godfather Charlie Van Straubenzee, and his brother Tom, Princess Charlotte's godfather, were also invited. ** Pick up your historic collector's edition OK!

But there was no formal entertainment. “The idea was for it to be very relaxed and casual, with people free to pop in and out as they wished. "It was a nice opportunity for the other royal children to meet Lilibet for the first time. “And as her first birthday is such a milestone, there was lots of discussion ahead of time about the presents that she would be given on the day. "One idea that proved very popular was a £75 pink Volkswagen Beetle ride-on toy, which had been spotted in Selfridges." Lilibet also received greetings from her grandfather Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and her aunt and uncle Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.
