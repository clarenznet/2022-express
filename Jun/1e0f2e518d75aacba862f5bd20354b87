The remains of the 57-year-old foreign correspondent and Brazilian government official Bruno, 41, were found in Amazon rainforest. Mr Phillips’ brother-in-law Paul Sherwood said the grim news was broken by the British ambassador to Brazil. Neither body has been formally identified but officials are confident they are the missing men and the manner of their discovery suggests foul play. All police would confirm last night was that they were examining “biological material”. Some of the mens’ possessions were found close to where they disappeared. Police have recovered a tarpaulin, laptop, Mr Phillips’ backpack and boots plus Mr Pereira’s trousers, boots and healthcare card by the Itaquai River in the Vale do Javari region of western Brazil. Mr Sherwood said the ambassador “wanted us to know they had found bodies” and “they were tied to a tree”. Maria Lucia Farias Sampaio, Mr Phillips’ mother-in-law, posted at the weekend: “They are no longer with us. Their souls have joined those of so many who gave their lives in defence of the rainforest and indigenous peoples.” Witnesses say they vanished on June 5 after being threatened over their investigation into illegal fishing, logging, mining and drug trafficking in the area. Fisherman Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira has been arrested over the men’s disappearance. He denies wrongdoing but locals claim police found blood in his boat. Denis Paiva, mayor of the nearby city Atalaia do Norte, said: “The crime’s motive is a feud over fishing inspection.” Mr Phillips has been based in Brazil for 15 years and worked for British and US newspapers. His relatives, in T-shirts with pictures of both missing men, held a protest on Sunday on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
