Denise Van Outen, 48, looked phenomenal in a series of pictures showing off her Ascot outfit choices. The actress stepped out to bask in the sun while modelling a number of ensembles, including a show stopping red trouser suit, which she paired with matching sunglasses. She also posed in a black and white polka dotted midi dress with balloon sleeves as she held up a glass of bubbly. In the last picture, Denise wore an elegant white ensemble consisting of a sleeveless blazer that cinched her waist and a lace trim blouse, with a bejeweled top hat.
