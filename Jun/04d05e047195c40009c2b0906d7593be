F1 returns this weekend around the tight streets of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for round eight of the season. Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes may still be struggling for pace on-track this weekend, but the seven-time champion enjoyed a big win overnight. The Briton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a vote on the matter was successful. The idea had been proposed by Brazil congressman Andre Figueredo last year in celebration of Hamilton’s love for the country. The Mercedes star unfurled the Brazilian flag on the podium after securing victory in a heated battle with Max Verstappen. Meanwhile, F1 teams and drivers have raised their dissatisfaction at the FIA’s handling of the sport. Many drivers have criticised the new race directors who some claim have a lack of experience. Mick Schumacher has also been issued a warning by Haas boss Guenther Steiner, claiming the German will face ‘serious conversations’ if he crashes this weekend. The 23-year-old has suffered two big accidents already this season, costing the team millions in expensive repairs.
