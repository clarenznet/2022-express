  Ned looked almost unrecognisable in his recent social media snaps, as he documented some of his travels along the West Coast with stunning partner Sophia. The pair could be seen posing in front of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Their other US destinations have included Napa Valley and Yosemite National Park in California. Ned, who sported a clean-cut look during his memorable time as Joe, could be seen rocking a fuzzy beard and a more cropped haircut.  The star wore a black denim jacket over a grey T-shirt with a pair of shades hanging loosely from it. Sophia pouted in a cute light blue outfit, accessorising with some hoop earrings. “SanFran,” the actor captioned the snap. Ned played Joe Tate on Emmerdale from 2017 to 2018. A couple of years later, he was spotted in the smash hit Netflix show Bridgerton, playing Lord Wetherby, who was the lover of Sir Henry Granville.
