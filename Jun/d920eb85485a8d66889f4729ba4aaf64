Gogglebox star Abbie Lynn has taken to Instagram to wow fans with her stunning bikini body after landing in Mallorca at the weekend. Abbie, 21, sparked a frenzy as she flaunted her incredible bikini body in a series of colourful bikinis. On Monday, Abbie appeared to be tanning as she put on her white bikini to get ready for a day out.  Clearly excited about her holiday, she wrote: "Happy b****y Monday."  The TV star wore her long hair down and straight as she headed out for breakfast at her resort. Abbie dazzled in another snap which showed her at the beach in a tie-dye red and orange two piece, which perfectly hugged her curvy figure.
