The TV personality had charged each of her fans £80 to attend the presentation in Hockley, Birmingham, which was supposed to have started at "4.30pm sharp" on Thursday. However, she got caught in traffic on the motorway and fans were still waiting by 5.45pm. The former glamour moedl arrived shortly after that but, by then, customers were frustrated, Birmingham Live reports. The star had posted on Instagram earlier: "So typical, all on time and guess what? On the motorway and this sign has popped up and now we're in traffic. "So we're probably going to be late for everything today now. Great. Great. Hardly even started the journey and look at this. Oh dear, oh dear." Staff at the Birmingham venue had to bring out glasses of water for the fans as they queued. "We've got other things to do," one woman, who wanted her money back, said. Jordan finally arrived in a Range Rover with her boyfriend Carl Woods and a dog, it is reported. The mum of five, who grew up in Brighton, East Sussex, wore bright pink fluffy slippers to the masterclass. The event was listed as "sold out" on Katie Price's website. A representative of Katie Price has been contacted for comment. The TV personality last month admitted breaching a restraining order and will return to court for sentencing. She had been banned from contacting her ex-husband's fiancée Michelle Penticost, directly or indirectly, for five years in 2019.
