The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's decision to move from Kensington Palace to the Windsor estate have been seen as a bid by the royal couple to appear like normal people. The argument was put forward by Julia Hartley-Brewer who mocked the "levels of degradation" Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge will now face living in the four-bedroom cottage without live-in staff. Ms Hartley-Brewer told TalkTV: "William and Kate are moving their family to a four-bedroom home in Windsor estate, Adelaide cottage, which needs no extra taxpayer funding security. "I think a lot of people will say, stop pretending you're like us you're not like us, your royalty and your rich" Asked whether Cambridge's move was "virtual signalling," Ms Hartley-Brewer agreed,  comparing the house swap to the couple travelling on Ryanair when they could just as easily fly by private jet. It comes amid reports the Queen is not expected to attend Royal Ascot for the second day running.  Racegoers will be disappointed by the absence of the head of state but they will be treated to the sight of other members of the royal family travelling in the traditional carriage procession on Thursday. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are once again expected to lead the royal party and are likely to spend the day studying the form of the thoroughbreds and enjoying the atmosphere. Charles and Camilla are due to take part in a traditional procession along the course and will travel in the lead carriage with the master of the Queen's household, Vice Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt. The Earl and Countess of Wessex will follow and Princess Beatrice, who on Tuesday walked through the gates of Royal Ascot with other racegoers, will travel in the third carriage with husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.
