Flight FR9085 from had been set to depart from East Midlands Airport (EMA) to Alicante in Spaine, but was delayed after a refuelling issue left liquid pouring out onto the tarmac. Passengers were reportedly sitting on the plane at around 7.30am and were then evacuated. According to Derbyshire Live, one passenger said they could see the fuel coming out and there was a "serious smell". They said: "Fuel was pouring out all over the tarmac, the smell of fuel was serious and they used what looked like commercial grade cat litter to soak it up." Passengers began re-boarding at around 11.30am and there are no reports of any injuries. Ryanair have been approached for comment. A spokesperson for EMA said: "A technical issue during re-fuelling delayed the departure of a Ryanair flight to Alicante this morning. The flight is due to leave early afternoon. It has had no impact on other operations."  People have commented on Derbyshire Live's Facebook page after seeing the announcement, expressing a lack of surprise given the recent chaos at airports most travellers have faced up and down the country. One user wrote: "Could have filled a few motors up. Guess someone forgot to close the cap off." Others expressed concern for those impacted by the situation: "Omg hope everyone is ok. "oh my god could you imagine. What a nightmare." Another posted: "My daughter and her friend were just getting on the plane They had a five hour delay I don’t mind that as long as safe"
