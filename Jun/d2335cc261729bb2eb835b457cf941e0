The tournament has faced backlash because of the involvement of Saudi Arabia, which many questions on the grounds of persistent and documented human rights violation claims. Organisers of the more prominent Ryder Cup have threatened participants of theÂ LIV Golf Invitational Series with expulsion. And Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood refused to answer when confronted about their involvement in the new tournament. During a joint press conference ahead of the start of Liv Golf, reporter Neil McLeman asked: "If Vladimir Putin had a tournament, would you play that?" Mr Poulter said: "I'm not even going to comment on speculation." The reporter once again attempted to push the golf player into addressing the question: "In a generality, is there any way you wouldn't play on a moral basis, if the money was right, is a way you wouldn't play?" Mr Poulter reiterated: "I don't need to answer that question."

He said: "You're just asking us to answer hypothetical questions now." When the reporter pointed out he was asking "moral questions", the golf star said: "I don't need to answer that question." The controversial breakaway circuit is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and offers a total prize fund of $255 million.
