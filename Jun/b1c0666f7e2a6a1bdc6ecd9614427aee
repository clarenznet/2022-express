A study reveals that a surprising 59 percent admitted they do not feel sorry for sufferers, with 51 percent saying they find people with colds and allergies irritating. And 46 percent even struggle to feel sorry for their own partner. Almost a quarter of allergy sufferers polled said they have been made to feel like an "outcast" by work colleagues because of their symptoms. David Palmer, from LG Electronics which commissioned the survey of 1,500 people, said: "This research shows the serious effects that allergies can have on people's lives, from having to miss out on social events to being overlooked at work." "There is a lot of misinformation."
