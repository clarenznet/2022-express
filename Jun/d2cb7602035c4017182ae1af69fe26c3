Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations will see much of the country coalesce around London during the four-day weekend. Tourists and Britons will flock in from outside the capital to enjoy several days of dedicated events, with city streets now adorned in Union Jacks. Residents trying to navigate some of those streets may experience trouble, with widespread closures making way for celebrations. London has opened up parts of the city for Jubilee events, meaning officials have closed several key streets for the coming weekend. Many of these closures will clog up London's centre around Buckingham Palace, meaning people should avoid travelling through, if possible. Officials will scatter additional road closures across the city's 32 boroughs. READ MORE: Australia PM sparks outrage over Queen demand 'Should be grateful!'
