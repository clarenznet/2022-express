England captain Harry Kane has fired back at a question from Channel 4 reporter Kelly Somers about the future of manager Gareth Southgate. The Three Lions were humiliated at the Molineux Stadium in Wolverhampton on Tuesday night as they were thumped 4-0 by Hungary in the Nations League. Following the match, England fans booed Southgate and his players as they left the pitch. And Somers wondered whether the Three Lions stars still believed they were heading in the right direction under the former defender. “Those chants were aimed at the manager on the touchline,” Somers said as she began her final question of the interview. “Just two games to go until Qatar. How confident are you that under him you’re on the right path?” Kane appeared to be put out by the reporter’s line of interrogation as he told Somers exactly what he thought of her question. “Yeah without any question,” the Tottenham striker replied. “That’s not even a question I should be answering if I’m honest.”
