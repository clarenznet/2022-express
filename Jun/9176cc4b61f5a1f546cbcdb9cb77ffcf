Bryce Dallas Howard, 41, looked fantastic in a cut-out dress as she attended the Jurassic World: Dominion premiere. The star-studded event took place last night at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. Bryce turned heads as she stepped onto the red carpet wearing a black full-length dress with a cut-out section that made sure her cleavage was on full display. The stunning film star wore her auburn hair down in a middle parting and opted for a make-up look that featured earthy tones, complementing her complexion. She posed alongside a huge prop dinosaur and next to her co-stars - Chris Pratt, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum. Laura has portrayed Claire Dearing in the adventure film Jurassic World (2015), and its sequels Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) and Jurassic World Dominion (2022).
