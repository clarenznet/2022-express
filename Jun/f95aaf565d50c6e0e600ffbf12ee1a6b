Police said the man had told them he was on the way to his first day at a new job - and his sat-nav told him to head southbound on the M5 between junction 17 for Cribbs Causeway and junction 18 for Avonmouth, so he did just that. Not only was the e-scooter he was riding illegal anyway - it was privately owned and not part of the legal Voi e-scooter pilot scheme - but the rider didn't have a driving licence anyway, Bristol Live reports. Avon and Somerset police's road policing unit tweeted out their astonishment at the discovery. "The rider of this e-scooter obviously didn’t have insurance but also didn’t have a licence as it had been refused on medical grounds," they said. "Then decided to follow his sat-nav to take him to work on his very first day down the hard shoulder of the M5 from Cribbs Causeway to Avonmouth," they added. Riding a priveate e-scooter anywhere in public is illegal - either on the road, pavement or cycle path - as the machines are not road legal and it's impossible to get insurance for them. Only the legitimate hire e-scooters run as part of Government pilot schemes to assess their safety, are legal - and they have geo-location devices which, in theory, should stop riders from getting onto a motorway.  Posting about the incident on Facebook, people had a lot to say about the driver and the e-scooter. Several commenters shared their frustration over e-scooters, saying that they had had run-ins with people riding them out and about. They also shared their disbelief about the fact that the rider had driven down the road. One user wrote: "Good grief. Poor employer taking on someone with not an ounce of common sense." Another said: "Nothing surprises me nowadays!" "No common sense."
