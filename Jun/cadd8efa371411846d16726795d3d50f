Ingredients Method For a unique take on a Pimm's cocktail, try a strawberry-infused gin instead. Strawberry gin is updating the classic "Pimm's" recipe for summer with a fresh take on a British cocktail stalwart. It has been created by chef Ben Ebbrell from the British Youtube channel Sorted Food exclusively for Express.co.uk. Ben told Express.co.uk readers said: "Obviously typically 'Pimms' is made with lemonade and then has all the various bits in, strawberry being one (along with apple, orange, cucumber, and mint). "To make it work with this Strawberry Gin Liqueur use 1/2 lemonade (clear not cloudy) and 1/2 soda water."
