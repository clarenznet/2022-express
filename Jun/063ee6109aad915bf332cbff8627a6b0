If you passed your driving test in any country outside of the EU/EEA you may only be able to drive on a valid driving licence for up to 12 months. This would be the case for most Ukrainians, as Ukraine is not in the EEA or EU. This means that if you arrive with a Ukrainian driving licence, you can only drive for 12 months. You will then need to apply for a provisional licence and pass the theory and practical driving tests to drive in Great Britain. To apply you must: The application costs £34 and you’ll need an identity document such as your passport, and you’ll also need to provide proof of address for the last 3 years. You may also be asked for your national insurance number. After this, you’ll need to take the theory and practical driving tests. Your theory test will cost you £23 for a car or motorcycle, and the test is in two parts: Your practical driving test will cost £62 if taken on a weekday or £75 on a weekend. However, if your licence comes from a country within the EU or EEA, the rules for driving in the UK will depend on the types of vehicles you drive. If you passed your driving test in the EU/EEA you can drive cars and motorcycles on a valid licence until the age of 70 or for 3 years (whichever is the longer period). You can drive lorries or buses on a valid licence until the age of 45 or for 5 years from becoming a resident (whichever is the longer period). If you’re over 45 but under 65 you can drive buses/lorries on a valid licence until your 66th birthday or for 5 years from becoming a resident (whichever is the shorter period). If you are aged 65 or over you can drive lorries and/or for one year from becoming a resident.
