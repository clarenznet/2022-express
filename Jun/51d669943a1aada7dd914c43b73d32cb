David Hasselhoff, 69 stepped out with wife Hayley Roberts, 42, yesterday in Monaco to make an appearance at the 61st Monte-Carlo Television Festival. The couple looked phenomenal as they posed for the cameras at a photocall for the Ze Network, in which David portrays the lead role. Hayley stunned as she went braless in a floral plunging mini dress, which she paired with some silver strappy heels. David looked dapper in a navy suit, which he paired with a pale pink shirt and patent black shoes, along with a pair of sunglasses.
