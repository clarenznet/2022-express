Kate Moss’s daughter, Lila, 19, looked the spitting image of mother as she modelled a brown mini skirt today. The model showed off her impossibly long legs during The Royal Academy of Arts summer preview party. The event took place at the Royal Academy of Arts in Central London and saw Lila wear a contrasting ensemble of maroon mini skirt and a geometrical print shirt in black, white and walnut brown. Lila paired the laid back style with a middle parted low bun and black heeled sandals.
