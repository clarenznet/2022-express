Princess Anne, the Queen’s daughter, is known for having a busy royal schedule and regularly demonstrates her dedication to public service. Anne was named as the hardest-working member of the Royal Family last year after carrying out 387 official appearances, beating her older brother Prince Charles by two events. As the hardest-working royal, one royal expert has suggested that she is “worthy of being considered Queen”. Kinsey Schofield, founder of To Di For Daily podcast and royal author told the Daily Star: “If anyone has proven that they are worthy of being considered for the top job, or likely inspired Queen Elizabeth, I think it's Anne, Princess Royal. “Arguably one of the hardest-working royals within the British Royal Family. “And while the history of her love life might not be pristine, she handled all issues with grace and as quietly as possible.” Anne has taken a more involved role in recent months to support the Queen as she is forced to miss appearances due to her ongoing episodic mobility issues. During the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, the Princess Royal joined Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Prince William in taking the Trooping the Colour salute. She also took the Queen’s place in leading the Royal Family at the Epsom Derby on Saturday, June 4. Anne was just third in line to the throne when she was born, but she now places 17th behind her brothers, their children and grandchildren. Ms Schofield said that both Anne and Charles would make “incredible monarchs”, However since Anne has a “much better reputation” than her brother, she would be appreciated by the public. She said: “The Princess Royal has a much better reputation than Prince Charles and a no-nonsense approach about the world. I think people appreciate her blunt honesty. “I think they both would make very different but incredible monarchs.” So what do YOU think? Should Princess Anne be considered for Queen?
