Emmerdale star Charley Webb, 34, has written some heartfelt words about her on-screen dad, Jeff Hordley, on Father’s Day. The former Debbie Dingle actress praised 52-year-old Jeff, who plays Cain Dingle, calling him her “one true TV dad”. Her biological father died suddenly when she was just 14, and she has previously credited her mum for “instantly becoming two parents” and raising Charley as well as her siblings, including Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas. The mum-of-three posted a photo with her late father, marking 20 years without him and urging her followers to “remember to love your people a lot” because “life is so short”. Jamie replied: “Miss him very much [love heart] sending you a big hug,” while several of Charley’s former Emmerdale co-stars also left sweet messages of support.
