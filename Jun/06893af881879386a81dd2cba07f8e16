A large cordon was put up in the heart of the city, as the device was found in the grass beside the tracks. A number of police vehicles and police officers could be seen guarding the area, Manchester Evening News reports.  Transport for Greater Manchester tweeted: "A665 Great Ancoats Street, City Centre, the road is closed in both directions between Adair Street and Store Street due to a police incident. Seek an alternative route." A builder working in the city centre said the suspicious device was discovered in the last hour close to Chapeltown Street, which is near the busy Manchester Piccadilly Station. Residents in the area had been evacuated. One woman said: "I've just been evacuated from our building on Chapeltown Street and we were told by police there's a suspicious package and they're evacuating all buildings due to a 'shatter risk' to windows and it could be a couple of hours." But the device was later deemed "non-suspicious" and the residents were allowed back in their properties after around two hours.  Some tram services were suspended while police investigate the find. A Greater Manchester Police statement on Twitter read: "Great Ancoats Street in Manchester City Centre is currently closed due to the discovery of a suspicious device. Following initial assessment, the device does not look to be viable, although this needs to be confirmed. The public are asked to avoid the area." It comes after residents on a housing estate in nearby Salford were evacuated yesterday after a "possible explosive device" was found there too. A bomb disposal unit was sent to the housing estate and a large cordon was put up. A reporter at the scene yesterday had tweeted: "A house was raided which led to the evac (evacuation) of surrounding houses when the device was found."
