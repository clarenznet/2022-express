The Queen’s cousin Prince Michael,79, and his wife Marie-Christine, 77, are reportedly looking to retire from public duties, with an official announcement expected soon. The Daily Telegraph reports that it is thought their retirement may coincide with Michael’s 80th birthday on July 4. However, it has not been confirmed and a spokesperson for the couple has not commented on the issue. The official Royal Family website states that Michael is “involved in around 100 charities and organisations, including being patron for a large number of these”. He is classified as a “non-working” royal but undertakes more than 200 public engagements within the non-profit sector, funded by his household rather than the taxpayer. Michael is often seen with the Queen alongside his siblings Princess Alexandra and the Duke of Kent. The Queen is 16 years older than her cousin at 96 and continues to carry out her duties. But her episodic mobility issues have forced her to pull out of several engagements and confirm appearances on the day. Earlier this month the nation celebrated Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee with a four-day weekend of festivities. Members of the Royal Family stepped up to take her place at several events but she did make two appearances on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Most recently, the Queen was absent from Royal Ascot and Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall ensured to leave a space in their carriage empty for her. Many of the Queen’s constitutional duties are now conducted via video conferencing to allow her to maintain a busy calendar. So what do YOU think?
