Johnny Depp whipped fans into a frenzy on Sunday as he took to the stage with Jeff Beck at the Helsinki Blues Festival in Finland. The Hollywood actor sported a youthful appearance as cut off his beard with a new clean shaven look. The 59-year-old wore a white shirt with his sleeves rolled up to show his tattoos as he sung. He wore a black waistcoat and a grey hat while he shielded his eyes behind a pair of mirrored sunglasses. His appearance comes after the performer's ex-wife admitted she can not afford to pay substantial damages to the actor following their defamation trial.
