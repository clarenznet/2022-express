Sharon Osbourne, 69, seems to be getting in plenty of babysitting practice before her daughter Kelly, 37, gives birth to her baby later this year. The TV star shared a series of snaps to her 1.1 million Instagram followers of herself cradling a very lifelike baby doll Sharon sat on some stairs as she held the doll in her arms and pretended to kiss her cheek. In the caption, the former X Factor judge tagged Kelly and added baby and gift emojis. In response, Kelly wrote in the comments: “You are F***ING nuts,” with a slew of laughing emojis. Kelly is currently pregnant with her first child with Slipknot DJ, Sid Wilson. Sharon's son, Jack, is also expecting a baby with his fiancee Aree Gearhart.
