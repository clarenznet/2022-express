Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 51, put on a sizzling display in a summery ensemble today as she matched her red hot dress with burgundy heels. She moved around in a circle making robotic movements interspersed with model poses in a video published to her 1.8 million Instagram followers this morning. The star was aiming for "mannequin" moves, which she explained in her post with some clever wordplay incorporating her name, captioning the video: "Mand’equin #dress @queensofarchive." She looked sensational in her floral patterned dress, which featured long flowing sleeves. Amanda regularly wears glamorous outfits - and a little thing like turning 50 was never going to stop the woman who posed naked atop a cake for her milestone birthday from embracing her sense of style. "When I hit 50 I invested in a pair of thigh-high boots and I thought, ‘THIS is how I’m going to live the second half of my life’," Amanda previously told The Sun.
