Bruce Willis, 67, had recently been diagnosed with aphasia - a brain condition - and as a result, the actor has stepped back from filming. The Die Hard star, who was previously married to Demi Moore, has been suffering from health issues in recent months his family previously shared in a candid Instagram post. The on-screen star has since been pictured out as he cut a casual figure when he stopped for a hot beverage while out in Los Angeles. The retired American actor sported a glum appearance as he was seen running errands. In other pictures, Bruce flashed a smile at the cameras. The Hollywood A-lister sported a grey t-shirt which he teamed with denim jeans and trainers. He accessorised his casual attire with a cream cap that slightly covered his eyes. The Sixth Sense actor displayed his grey beard as he could be seen leaving Starbucks. It comes after his family announced the actor was living with aphasia - according to the National Aphasia Association, the condition is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write.
