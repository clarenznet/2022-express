It may only be in the infant stages, but already the transfer window is sparking into life. Clubs are wasting little time in getting their squad business under way, knowing that the longer the window stays open, the higher the prices go. Liverpool are today set to formally announce the arrival of record signing Darwin Nunez, after the 22-year-old completed the latter stages on his eye-watering move from Benfica - just a day after arch title rivals Manchester City confirmed the official arrive of wonderkid Erling Haaland. Elsewhere, Manchester United are back in the market after already missing out on several targets - including Nunez. Now, however, the Red Devils look poised to go up against Liverpool once again as both teams very much like the look of an emerging Italian prodigy. Gabriel Jesus now appears ever closer to signing on the dotted line for Arsenal. The Brazilian ace is not short of suitors, though a potential lucrative La Liga switch to Real Madrid has now found itself in hot water. With options being shutdown, Jesus is in a prime position to once again link up with his former coach Mikel Arteta, this time wearing the red of the Gunners. The cash is soon to be flashed on a major scale as Everton find themselves subject of a takeover bid, which could see a familiar face in the world of Premier League chiefs making a return to England's top division.
