Things are well and truly heating up in the Premier League with the summer transfer window set to officially open on June 10. Of course, that has not stopped the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal trying to put things in place before then, and there are plenty of high-profile storylines taking shape as bids fly in for some of Europe's top players. United are hoping to hit the ground running under new boss Erik ten Hag, and they have so far been relentless in their pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. That deal has already seen its fair share of twists and turns, while those behind the scenes at Old Trafford are also thought to be working on deals that would bolster other areas of the pitch. One huge talent they could miss out on, however, is Darwin Nunez. Liverpool majorly ramped up their interest in the Benfica marksman on Wednesday, and all parties may not be far away from a total agreement in what would be one of the summer's biggest moves. Arsenal and Chelsea are involved too, although not too positively for the Gunners as Everton star Richarlison would reportedly snub north London in favour of Stamford Bridge.
