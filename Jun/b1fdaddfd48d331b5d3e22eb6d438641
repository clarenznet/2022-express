The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reportedly received "cast iron assurances" their family will be protected by specially trained police officers when they arrive in the UK today. Security sources have revealed the Met’s Royalty and Specialist Protection unit has spent weeks liaising with the Sussex's team and guaranteed taxpayer-funded officers. The promise comes after a bitter legal row with the Government after a Home Office decision to strip him of his security. A source said: “There has been further contact between the Duke and members of his family, but any talk of them planning to cause a scene or detract from the Queen’s celebrations is nonsense. They are here to see family and enjoy what will undoubtedly be an incredible moment in history.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
