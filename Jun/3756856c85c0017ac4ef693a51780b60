Madonna, 63, has wowed her fans with her latest video on social media, in which she dances in a studio in front of a fan. The Like a Prayer songstress stroked her legs seductively as the camera panned around her. She wore a black studded bondage-style top, floral shorts and black stockings, while her long blonde tresses flowed around her face. “Big Fun……………,” she captioned the post, alongside several love heart emojis in different colours, which matched the rainbow filter effect on the video. Her followers were delighted by the legendary singer’s ageless display, with @dazesplace even branding her “Queen of everything”.
