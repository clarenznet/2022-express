Whitney Henriquez, 34, said the "cards were stacked against us" in the six-week US trial, which found in favour of Pirates Of The Caribbean star Depp, 58, last week. But she said on Instagram: "I still stand with you, sissy. We knew that this was going to be an uphill battle. But you stood up and spoke out regardless."  Meanwhile, Depp has thanked his "most treasured, loyal and unwavering supporters" in his first post on video platfrom TikTok.
