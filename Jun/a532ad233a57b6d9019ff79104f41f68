Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament yesterday that she would like the SNP to hold a second independence referendum on October 19, 2023. The date is not set in stone, as the UK's Supreme Court must decide whether the vote can go ahead or not. Westminster may wish to quash attempts from the Scottish Government to force the vote, and Boris Johnson has expressed his opposition to another referendum in the past. After the announcement yesterday, a Number 10 spokesman said the Government's position "remains unchanged". They added: "But a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully study the details of the proposal and the supreme court will now consider whether to accept the Scottish government’s lord advocate’s referral." With the referendum's effects guaranteed to spread beyond Scotland to the rest of the UK, should the Prime Minister allow it to go ahead?
