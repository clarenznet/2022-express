The Platinum Jubilee celebrates Queen Elizabeth II's 70th year on the throne in 2022, with people spending the bank holiday weekend remembering her contributions to the UK.

The list of people lined up to receive one of nine awards in the Queen's birthday honours was released by the Government today. Below is a summary of the top honours and those receiving them, if you'd like to see the full list click here. The century-old Order of the Companions of Honour, founded in 1917, will receive three new appointments in 2022. The order recruits those who have dedicated their lives to the arts, government, medicine and science. The birthday honours list includes English and creative writing professor Dame Marina Warner, illustrator Sir Quentin Blake and Sir Salman Rushdie this year. The Order of the British Empire (OBE) splits into five distinct categories, with the two highest rankings being Dame Grand Cross and Knight recipients. Anyone awarded an OBE can use the Sir or Dame moniker before their first name, but the Dame Grand Cross is a cut above both and recognises outstanding industry contributions. In 2022, Dame Sue Ion, the chairwoman of the UK Nuclear Innovation Research Advisory Board (NIRAB), is on the list.
