Madonnaâ€™s children, Lourdes Leon, 25, and Rocco Ritchie, 21, were photographed together last night during Men's Paris Fashion Week. Lourdes confidently walked the runway for Marine Serre while Rocco supported her from the audience. The brother-sister duo also posed for pictures together backstage, with Lourdes playfully sticking her tongue out at the camera. Rocco looked dapper in an elegant camel-toned suit, while his sister wore a chic all-black ensemble consisting of a crop top, wide leg trousers and a maxi cardigan.
