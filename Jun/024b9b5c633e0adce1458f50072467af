Queen Letizia looked majestic as usual on June 10, 2022. She met with the new Board of Directors of the Ibero-American Alliance of Rare or Infrequent Diseases. Next, she received representatives of the participants in the Congress on Trafficking in Human Beings. The Spanish monarch looked stylish in a floral patterned blouse and white trousers. The white blouse was decorated with various pink flowers and feathers, with pops of yellow as well. The high-neck garment was loosely tucked into a pair of three-quarter length straight-legged off-white trousers. Letizia paired the look with Magrit Dalila Pumps in bone white.

Just last month, Letizia presented The 2021 National Research Awards In Barcelona. She paired the pumps with a vibrant orange dress. Yesterday, she kept jewellery to a minimum yesterday and let her floral blouse do the talking. However, the monarch did wear some timeless gold hoops and her statement Karran Hallam gold ring. This gorgeous oval ring is more synonymous with Queen Letizia than her own engagement ring as she wears it so much. On the official Karran Hallam website, the jewel is called the "signature ring". It is described as a "handmade unique ring in solid silver". The website also reads: "The perfect gift for her. Handmade jewellery. Everyday jewellery." The ring ranges from €110.00 - €1,100.00 (around £94-940) depending on size and material. It is available in silver, gold-plated silver, and solid gold.
