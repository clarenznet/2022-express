Princess Charlotte and Prince George attended the Platinum Party at the Palace this weekend, but they seemed to lose interest an hour into the performances. BBC One aired the once-in-a-lifetime concert, which took place outside Buckingham Palace, and it featured some huge names. Viewers slammed the broadcaster for not giving the youngsters "a break".  Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber appeared on stage to perform alongside actors from musicals including The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera. The crowd went wild for the performances, with the camera then panning to Princess Charlotte and Prince George in the audience. Charlotte was seen looking down into her lap whilst playing with a Union Jack flag. George could be seen looking in the opposite direction to the stage, seemingly unamused.

"They’re kids, having to sit through hours of stuff for grown ups that isn’t exactly scintillating (unless u love musicals). #PlatinumPartyatthePalace" @beeing_sophie said: "Anyone else feeling that George and Charlotte might just need an early bedtime after their trip to Wales?!  "Poor kids look shattered and I just worry what the press will make of the photos." @purrsandskirts added: "Feeling a bit sorry for George and Charlotte, they're too young for sitting through such long events and in formal clothes again, too. "Other monarchies seem to manage a more relaxed approach. #PlatinumPartyAtThePalace."  @CharlieWalton concluded: "Everyone saying Prince George and Princess Charlotte are 'bored'.  "They were in Cardiff mere hours ago - they've had a busy day! At their age I'd have been zonked out my seat! #PlatinumPartyatthePalace" Later on, the cameras showed Charlotte enjoying herself with mum Kate Middleton as they waved flags to 'Sweet Caroline'. @RoyallyBelle_ said: "Katherine and Charlotte also enjoying Sweet Caroline! Clearly a family favourite #PlatinumPartyatthePalace." @Bigcarebear added: "So lovely to see Prince George and Princess Charlotte waving their flags with their mam and dad #PlatinumJubilee #PlatinumPartyatthePalace."
