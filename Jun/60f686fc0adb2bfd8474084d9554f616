The TaxPayers' Alliance warned that health chiefs were "blowing our cash" when patients are facing record waiting lists. Among the treatments bought privately were MRI scans and physiotherapy. Trusts have spent more than £37million on private occupational health services, according to political intelligence firm Baker Kell Cumming. TaxPayers' Alliance chief executive John O'Connell said: "NHS staff should suck it up and use the services that the rest of us have to and stop blowing our cash on private healthcare." East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust revealed it had paid £125,000 to an occupational physiotherapy firm since 2018. A spokesman said its staff were "working flat out" to tackle the backlog and "treatment means they can return to work more quickly".
