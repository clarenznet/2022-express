Carol Vorderman, 61, apologised last night to fans after posting a makeup free video on her social media. Despite her candid apology, the Countdown star looked fantastic in a dressing gown and wearing her natural blonde locks down, framing her face. In view of her 226,000 Instagram followers, she said: “Excuse the state of me. I’m in my dressing gown, it’s been a long drive home from Anglesey. “So, I’m filming myself talking to you about watching myself on the telly watching the telly. Bizarre.”
