They were taking evidence from experts into the cause of ongoing chaotic scenes at airports. Sue Davies, at consumer group Which?, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that airlines appear to be taking bookings for flights they can't guarantee.  Customers, she added, "haven't really been given proper information about their rights. "There's just blatant flouting of consumer rights and a failure to put passenger interests first." The head of consumer rights at Which?, said the industry and the Government should shoulder blame for the chaos. Unite union's aviation expert Oliver Richardson said the airlines that made the most severe pandemic job cuts are those cancelling the most flights. Lisa Tremble, British Airways corporate affairs director told MPs a decision to sack 10,000 workers in 2020 was to "secure the future of the airline and save as many jobs as possible". Labour MP Darren Jones, committee chairman, asked her: "Do you think there was a connection between sacking 10,000 staff using aggressive fire-and-rehire tactics, and now cancelling the most flights per day?" Ms Tremble said: "It's very complicated."
