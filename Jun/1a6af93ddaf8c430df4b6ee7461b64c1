The actress, 63, said she felt modern feminism was about women “finding our space” rather than being “more like men”.   She said: “I’m not sure how great the sexual revolution was. “I’m not sure whether it benefited us in the ways that are loudly bruited these days. “It made us more available, I suppose, for sex. It also introduced something else, which feels to me now when I look back on it a little bit predatory.”
