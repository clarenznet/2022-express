Karen Hauer walked down the aisle to marry the “love of her life” Jordan Wyn-Jones, as she wore a dazzling “fairytale dress” complete with a plunging neckline during an intimate ceremony. The Strictly Come Dancing star, 40, and her beau were married at Chewton Glen in Hampshire last Tuesday.  Among the guests celebrating that day were Karen's fellow Strictly co-stars including Luba Mushtuk, who featured as a bridesmaid, and It Takes Two host Janette Manrara. The dance professional told Hello! magazine about her “fairytale dress”, which was a handmade tulle and floral applique gown by Berta. It contained a light floral pattern and a deep neckline, while the groom wore a three-piece black suit. She said: “It’s my fairytale dress. It’s something I never thought I’d go for but I knew right away that it was ‘the dress’ when I tried it on.” On the wedding, she added: “It was exactly what we had envisioned – but even better. It was like a breath of fresh air for us.”
