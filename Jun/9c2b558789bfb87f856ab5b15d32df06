Chancellor Rishi Sunak revised his cost of living support package in late May, providing targeted support for those on low income, pensioners and disabled Britons. However, disabled Britons must be claiming a qualifying benefit in order to be eligible for the support. The following benefits are eligible for the £150 support:   Britons must have been receiving their qualifying benefit on May 25, 2022 to be eligible. Those that get a disability benefit from the Ministry of Defence and another from the DWP they will only receive the cost of living payment from the DWP. The payment is expected to be made from September 2022. Britons should not need to apply for this support as it is expected to be automatically delivered to them. None of the cost of living support payments are taxable and they will also not affect the benefits cap. If they also receive a qualifying low income benefit they can get an additional cost of living support payment. Britons who get certain benefits or tax credits may qualify for £650 cost of living support. This payment will be split into two payments of £326 and £324 paid at varying times depending on what benefit or tax credit made them eligible for the payment. To be eligible for the low income cost of living support payment, one must be claiming any of the following: Britons needed to be in receipt of one of these benefits on May 25, 2022 to be eligible for the first payment of £326. It has not yet been revealed what the qualifying day will be for the second payment. People who have a joint claim with their partner will receive a total of £650 for the both of them if they are entitled. For low income benefit recipients, the first payment is expected in July with the second due in autumn. For those receiving tax credits, their first payment is expected in autumn this year with the second due in winter.
