It comes after fears Putin may be planning a further invasion. Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, said: "We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000."  It comes ahead of a NATO summit in Madrid later this week. The NATO response force currently has some 40,000 troops. At the Madrid summit, NATO will also change its language on Russia that in the alliance's last strategy from 2010 was still described as a strategic partner. "That will not be the case in the strategic concept that we will agree in Madrid," Stoltenberg said.   "I expect that allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order." It will come as a direct blow to Putin who ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine on February 24. Mr Stoltenberg also confirmed that Nato will expand troop deployments in its European member countries that are closest to Russia. The Western allies will also strengthen their air defences and increase their stockpiles of military supplies, he said.

It comes after Putin was dealt a blow after Russia defaulted on its overseas debt for the first time in more than ten years. The Kremlin was determined to avoid the label, which is likely to be subject to mockery on the world stage. Its failure is, however, a result of sanctions imposed by the West in response to its invasion of Ukraine and the closure of payment routes to creditors rather than of a lack of cash. On Sunday, the grace on around $100million of interest payments due on May 27 expired.
