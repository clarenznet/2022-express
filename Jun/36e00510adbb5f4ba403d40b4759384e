Cliff Richard, 81, seemed glum as he arrived at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club today. The singer appeared downcast as he attended Wimbledon for the second time this week before cracking a smile and waving at photographers. Cliff looked smart in a teal suit over a white shirt. He complemented the dapper ensemble with a matching tie and pocket square. Cliff also pinned a red rose to his left lapel. The Summer Holiday singer shielded his eyes with some sunglasses as he enjoyed the tennis.
