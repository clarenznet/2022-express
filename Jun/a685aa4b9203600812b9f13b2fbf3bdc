Tristram Spencer, 35, raided one home for high-value goods including luxury watches and the owner's Jaguar XFR. When the victim returned in their BMW and discovered the break-in, they dialled 999 - only to see Spencer drive off in the BMW. He was caught, charged and bailed for that crime in Banstead, Surrey. But days later he carried out a similar raid - making off with another BMW- in Fetcham, also Surrey. A court heard he targeted swish homes in Berkshire too. PC Joseph Brown said: "Having caused devastation within the victim's homes, he'd brazenly return while they reported these crimes to steal their last financial asset from under their noses." Spencer, of Purley, south London, admitted burglary and other offences and got seven years' jail at Guildford Crown Court.
