Trooping the Colour is the first day of celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee weekend. Meghan Markle was in attendance looking radiant as ever. Meghan Markle looked chic as always in a classic off-the-shoulder navy dress. She paired this a wide-brimmed white hat which boasted a large navy bow. That hat was certainly the statement piece of the outfit. The Duchess of Sussex wore her long tresses down in loose curls, and as for makeup, she went for a smokey eye.
