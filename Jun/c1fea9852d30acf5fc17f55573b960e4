Perry Jones, 27, was fined £120 yesterday after admitting being drunk and disorderly during the incident last month. A court heard around 50 mourners reached "varying levels of intoxication" at the wake, which was being held "in and around" Sunny's Bar in Towyn, North Wales. A member of staff at the bar called police when some of the group became rowdy and refused to leave when they were asked to do so, North Wales Live reports. But Jones "shouted and swore" at officers when they arrived. District Judge Rhys Williams fined Jones in his absence yesterday as his car had broken down. The defendant must also pay £85 costs and a £34 surcharge. He pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly. Ceri Nash, prosecuting, said: "When police arrived there was somewhat of a melee outside. "The defendant was standing in the doorway of Tinkers Bar nearby. He became agitated when officers approached him. "He was shouting and swearing - a lot of people were milling around - and he was clenching his fists towards them." Ms Nash said the defendant Jones was "clearly intoxicated, his eyes glazed and smelling strongly of alcohol." Jones, from Rhyl, North Wales, swore again at a police dog handler, who was there to support the other officers, and Jones was behaving in an aggressive manner, the court heard. Children were also present, added the prosecutor. A teenager is due to appear on a public order charge at Llandudno Youth Court on July 5.
