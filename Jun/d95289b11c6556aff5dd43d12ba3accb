Awash with pinkness and funked up with choreographer Ellen Kane's Beyonce-style dance moves, this reboot is not so much a musical as a girl band gig with a story attached.Â The show (last seen in 2011 with Sheridan Smith) has been deftly realigned by Lucy Moss - one half of the duo responsible for the hyperbole-inspiring SIX - for its prime target audience: Generation Z. Moss is intent on inclusivity with gender fluidity, plus-size dancers and clunky LGBTQ+ references thrown into the mix. But she has sacrificed the vestigial humanity that anchored the original. The stakes are reduced to zero as Elle's psychological wounds are skated over in a tsunami of confidence. There is little emotional sinew between her and person-of-interest Emmett, in spite of Michael Ahomka-Lindsay's quietly outstanding performance, or between hairdresser Paulette (Nadine Higgin) and her Irish delivery guy. The substitution of real dogs with dog-suited actors who embark on a doggy-style romance is frankly embarrassing. Elle's besties as a Greek chorus are quite fun but it's a gag too far in a production that seems inordinately pleased with itself. Yes, it IS fun, it IS generous-hearted and, yes, there are some stunning sequences - particularly the Whipped Into Shape section in which accused murderer Brooke (Lauren Drew) sings and dances with a skipping rope accompanied by a squadron of skipping gym bunnies. Bowman is a charismatic presence and Higgin is a vocal powerhouse. But it amounts to a vacuous cartoon that has undergone emotional liposuction and, by the end, I felt I'd been whipped into a froth that left me amused but undernourished. Legally Blonde the Musical is at Regents Park Open Air Theatre until July 2. Tickets: 0333 400 3562
