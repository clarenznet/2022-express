EastEnders fans are excited to find out what's in store for the characters on the Square in the BBC One hit soap. The show usually airs from Mondays to Thursdays on BBC One, but viewers may have noticed it is not a part of the channel's schedule this week. Express.co.uk has all you need to know about how to watch EastEnders and why it will not be on its usual TV channel. EastEnders fans are in for a treat this week as the soap will see plenty of drama in Albert Square. Viewers have been tuning in on weekday evenings to find out who is at the centre of the explosive storylines. This week will be slightly different as the soap will not be airing in its usual slot on BBC One. This is because of various sporting events taking place throughout the summer. This week, Wimbledon 2022 is being aired across various channels, meaning EastEnders has been moved to a different channel.

It will debut on the streaming platform with all of its week-long episodes at 6am on Monday mornings. The move will begin tonight, June 27, until mid-August to avoid Wimbledon clashes. This means viewers will be able to watch the programme whenever it suits on BBC iPlayer, or to tune in as the episodes air on BBC Two. Despite the change of channels from BBC One to BBC Two, the soap will continue to be shown at the same time of 7.30pm Monday to Thursday. Meanwhile, the Wimbledon tournament is being shown live on both BBC One and BBC Two throughout the day. This summer, the Mitchells will be at the centre of the drama as Phil (played by Steve McFadden) makes an enemy in prison.

Ben (Max Bowden) also appears to be struggling after his horrific attack and his family fear he will lose control.

"Such as shame as EastEnders is so so good at the moment. You should have kept it on BBC1 and moved Wimbledon to BBC2." @cleanfeed_ttvr added: "Not the best news for the struggling soap."  EastEnders is available to watch on BBC iPlayer and BBC Two from 7.30pm
