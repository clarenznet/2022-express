The flight attendant also shared a very useful money-saving hack for those who are travelling on a budget.  For those passengers who want to save money on holiday, Nassim recommended bringing their own food on the plane as the crew is able to assist with that. The flight attendant explained if passengers bring their food in oven-proved containers, the crew will be able to warm it up in the ovens they have on the plane. The crew can also provide cutlery and paper cups if necessary. Nassim explained: "I would absolutely say bring your own food 100 percent!! "Go and get snacks the night before. "Don’t get anything at the airport it’s so expensive!" However, the flight attendant pointed out that "buying stuff on the plane or at the airport is also part of the travelling experience so if you can splurge why not". "But yes, for saving money I would absolutely say bring own snacks!! "Saves so much money and you get so much more. "Also the options we have onboard are limited. "We can’t always guarantee everything will be in stock or that it will be enough for everyone," she explained.
