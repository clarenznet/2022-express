The film's creator George Lucas had tasked Cantwell with designing the Death Star, the TIE fighter and the Star Destroyer. But he couldn't visualise the shape of the X-wing until the image of the dart popped into his brain. He imagined it appearing as a cowboy drawing his guns.  Cantwell was hired to create photographic effects in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and proposed its nowiconic opening Sun, Moon and Earth sequence. Colin James Cantwell was born in San Francisco, California, to graphic artist James and his wife Fanny, a riveter during the Second World War. For almost two years of his childhood in Arizona he was confined to his bedroom with tuberculosis and a partial retinal detachment. While studying engineering at the University of California he petitioned faculty staff for a new course in animation and became its inaugural student. He was offered a place at celebrated architect Frank Lloyd Wright's school after requesting a meeting with him. Wright died months later so Cantwell returned to his space passion and began producing education programmes about future missions for Nasa. This led to him becoming Nasa's communication liaison for the 1969 Moon landing as the go-between between the astronauts and TV journalist Walter Cronkite. He also worked on Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and WarGames. He is survived by his partner Sierra Dall.  Colin Cantwell born April 3 1932, died May 21, 2022, aged 90
