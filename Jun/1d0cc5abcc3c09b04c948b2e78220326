Andrew George, former MP for St Ives, proposed that tourists boycott the properties if they find out they are making the housing crisis worse for local people. This comes as Cornwall's house prices continue to rise by more than £100 a day while properties keep being converted into holiday lets. It is now easier to book a holiday in the county than find a place to live due to the increasing number of landlords tapping into the lucrative holiday market, reports Cornwall Live. In March, Newquay had 20 times more Airbnbs than homes available to rent. The same month, a Cornwall resident raised concerns after he noticed that there were 252 Airbnbs in the St Agnes Parish, while there were only 22 properties for sale and one property to rent in the same area.  Mr George told The Guardian: "[Holidaymakers] should ask [the landlord] before they come: 'Can you assure me this accommodation is not having a negative impact on housing need?'" He continued that tourists who "find the housing needs of people in the area are being overlooked could write to the owner of the property and say they are never coming again". In the last few weeks, people have been seen setting up camp near the sea, including one man who said that he was homeless and on every housing register, waiting to be offered suitable accommodation. Monique Collins, of charity DISC Newquay, previously said: "People are desperate, no accommodation anywhere, working families being made homeless all the time with nowhere to go. "When are we finally going to see some action? All talk and no walk is all I see. "People being put in campsites being treated like cattle as they describe it? "Well I know that if these people were dogs, cats, cows or sheep there would be a national outcry. "So why isn’t there one for our own local working people?"
