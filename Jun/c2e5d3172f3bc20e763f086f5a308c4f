Having completed his US tour and celebrated his 80th birthday, Sir Paul McCartney was honoured to be Glastonbury Festival’s oldest ever headliner. During his set from the Pyramid stage, he invited Dave Grohl on in his first public performance since Foo Fighters’ drummer Taylor Hawkins suddenly died in March. The music stars soon burst into renditions of I Saw Her Standing There and Wings’ Band On The Run. Later on in the show, McCartney surprised fans further by introducing Bruce Springsteen, who previously cameoed at his New York show earlier this month. The duo performed Glory Days and The Beatles’ I Wanna Be Your Man together, before a third star “joined” Macca. Near the end of his set, McCartney shared how Peter Jackson, who directed The Beatles: Get Back documentary for Disney+, could edit footage of John Lennon to be able to virtually duet with his old songwriting partner. The 80-year-old said: “I’ve got a special little thing here. One day, Peter Jackson rings me up and says he can take John’s vocals and isolate them so that you can play live with John on tour. He said do you fancy that?” The clips of the late star, who died in 1980, were taken from The Beatles’ rooftop performance in 1969, the Fab Four’s final live show. With Lennon on screen behind, he and McCartney were able to sing I’ve Got A Feeling together from The Beatles’ last album Let It Be. Fans can check out the set when it was previously performed in the US below, or on BBC iPlayer when made available later today. Afterwards, an emotional Macca told the Glastonbury crowd: “That’s so special for me man. I know it’s virtual but come on – it’s John. We’re back together.” Following on, both Grohl and Springsteen joined him back on stage for an incredible improvised guitar riff off.
