Andy Murray had to come from a set down before beating Australian James Duckworth in his opening Wimbledon match on Monday. The Brit was making his first appearance since suffering a side strain injury in Stuttgart, which ruled him out of playing at Queen's.  The three-time major champion was adamant the issue was behind in his pre-tournament presser. But Murray's metal hip still notably restricts his movement compared to his former self and Duckworth took full advantage to win the opening set. Murray then dug deep to win the second before he began to find his rhythm in the crucial third. At that point, Duckworth was letting more and more unforced errors creep into his game with Murray growing in confidence and two double faults ultimately cost the 30-year-old in the end.
