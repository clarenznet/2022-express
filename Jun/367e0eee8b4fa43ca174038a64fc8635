Hughie Fury and Michael Hunter's WBA heavyweight title eliminator bout has been postponed due to the Brit falling ill according to reports. The pair were due to headline a Sky Sports boxing show at the AO Arena, Manchester on July 2 but will now seek a new date.   A win for either man would have mandated them for a shot at Daniel Dubois’ WBA ‘regular’ heavyweight title and a No 1 ranking with the sanctioning body. Reports from The Sun also suggest that Ricky Hatton's exhibition fight against Marco Antonio Barrera, which was due to take place at the same arena on the same night is also off.
