Linda Evangelista, 57, took to social media, with a black and white snap, where she could be seen posing with Christy and friends Inge Fonteyne and Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele at Kappo Masa restaurant in New York, on Friday. The mother-of-one reshared the snap of their epic reunion from Carlyne, who captioned the post: "BEST DINNER with BEST OLD FRIENDS last night… BEST TIME. "@lindaevangelista @cturlington @ingefonteyne #carlynecerfdedudzeele #family #besttime #bestfriends #beststories #bestlaughs #jadore #always #CCD." Claudia Schiffer replied to the photo with three red love heart emojis. While Cindy Crawford commented: "Now that’s a Girl’s Night Out!" Marc Jacobs penned: "The best of the BEST," with four red love heart emojis in the comments. The stunning snap comes after the former supermodel shared with fans that she had "developed Paradoxical Adipose Hyperplasia or PAH" last year after CoolSculpting treatments left her with a "disfigured" face. She revealed that it had "not only destroyed my livelihood, but it has also sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness, and the lowest depths of self-loathing" and that she had "become a recluse".
