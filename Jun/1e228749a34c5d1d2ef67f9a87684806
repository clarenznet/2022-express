Today, Crown Princess Mary and Prince Frederik of Denmark are in The Hague, Netherlands. The royal couple attended the grand opening of the Dutch-Danish business conference in New Babylon. Princess Mary looked fabulous in a ‘Scanlan Theodore Tailored Jacket in Coral’. She paired these with her ‘Scanlan Theodore Tailored Wide Leg Trousers in Coral’. To complete the trio, Mary wore her ‘Scanlan Theodore Crepe Knit Square Camisole in Coral’. She paired this coral suit with a Chanel tote bag which costs roughly £2,181. Mary styled her hair in a bouncy blow-dry down her ears and wore natural-looking makeup. Instagram user @rmsgreeneyedlady posted: "That suit is so beautiful."
