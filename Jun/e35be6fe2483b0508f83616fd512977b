Stacey Solomon, 32, enjoyed a day by the pool on Saturday and took the opportunity to try out some bikinis from her new swimwear range. Modelling a floral, pink bikini, Stacey filmed herself in front of a mirror and admitted to her 5.2 million followers that she was worried the two-piece wouldn’t “cover everything”.She said in a clip: “I am wearing one of my bikinis today. This is one of the samples from my swimwear range, I'm so excited.“I’m just testing them out at the minute, I haven’t got all of them, this is just one.“I’m making sure they hold me up and cover everything. And, so far, so good!”She added in the caption: “Wearing a sample from my In The Style swim collection to product test today. So far so good it covers my moon and bum and holds my boobs in.”Stacey has four children. Her youngest, Rose, was born in October. She also has Rex, three, Leighton, 10, and Zachary, 14.
