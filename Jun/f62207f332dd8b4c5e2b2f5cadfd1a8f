A long train of velvet hung down on one side of the dress which complemented the satin skirt. Yesterday wasn't the first time Fergie has worn a green ensemble. She stepped out at her daughter, Princess Eugenie's, wedding in a marvellous green knee-length dress.

One was a blue string bracelet featuring a green heart. Another was black and featured a crucifix. On the other hand she wore two more delicate barely-there bracelets.
