Mel C looked fabulous earlier today as she walked around Wimbledon's Centre Court on day four of the tournament. The Spice Girls star commanded attention in an extremely chic orange blazer and shorts ensemble. She kept the look relaxed yet stylish with some nude strappy heels and a white t-shirt underneath the striking co-ord. The singer carried around a small clutch bag as she posed for the cameras at the All England Tennis club.
