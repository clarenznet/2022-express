Sky News correspondent Annelise Nielsen said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “sat out” a number of the main events held across the Platinum Jubilee weekend, including the Party at the Palace concert. She said: “I think that was pretty deliberate – that they didn’t want to be drawing attention away from anything. When speaking to people here – the diehard royal fans – a lot of them say that they are disappointed in how Harry and Meghan have conducted their step back from royal life, that they don’t agree with many of their criticisms of the Royal Family. But they do say … he is the Queen’s grandson and so there should be respect for the monarch and in that instance it does mean her heirs as well.” Harry and Meghan attended the thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday but were notably absent from other public events and went home before the pageant on Sunday.
