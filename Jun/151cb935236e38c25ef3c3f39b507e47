Some 12 fire crews battled the flames at the historic property in Braintree, Essex, after it caught fire at around midnight. Firefighters have remained at the scene overnight and say there has been "extensive damage" to the cottage. It's unclear what caused the blaze at this stage. A full investigation into what happened will now take place, Essex Live reports. Station Manager Howard Midwood said: "Sadly there has been extensive damage to an historical thatched cottage but thanks to the skill and professionalism of the firefighters, the fire was stopped from spreading to the neighbouring properties and as many personal possessions as possible could be saved from inside. "Our control room team also did a fantastic job, co-ordinating the response."  The roof of the property in particular has been damaged significantly. Three fire crews remain at the property at the time of writing. It is unclear at this stage if anyone has been injured in the fire. East of England Ambulance Service have been approached for comment. Roads in the area have been closed, and traffic is particularly heavy on the A120 in both directions around Braintree. Some bus routes may also be affected.
