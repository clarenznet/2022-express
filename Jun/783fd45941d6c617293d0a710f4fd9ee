The actress, 54, who is also producing the new movie through her Red Om Films company, is no doubt hoping for a hit as big as the best-selling book it is named after. In the disaster novel, written by Rumaan Alam, a mum and dad and their two teenage children go on a beach break only to have it wrecked from the moment a mystery couple turn up at their door. Julia and her screen husband Ethan Hawke, 51, were seen filming on location at Sunken Meadow State Park, on the northern shore of New York State's Long Island, earlier this week. There was no sign of the actress's famous smile, inset, as she and her co-stars packed up and fled in panic from the beach. Also starring in the thriller are Kevin Bacon, 63, and Mahershala Ali, 48, who was offered the job when Denzel Washington quit. A release date for the film, which will be streamed on Netflix, has not been announced yet.
