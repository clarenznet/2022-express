South Carolina governor Nikki Haley told the Policy Exchange that Brexit will be a "positive game-changer for the future of Europe" and should be strongly supported by the United States. She stressed the importance of a united western front in response to Russian aggression. She explained: "This is a clash of civilizations â€” a classic struggle between light and darkness, good and evil, right and wrong.

The former US Ambassador to the UN added: "Our challenges are steep, but they are not too steep to overcome, so long as we believe in ourselves and our fight for freedom. We have no higher calling as the heirs of liberty." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
