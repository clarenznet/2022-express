England put in yet another dismal performance at Molineux on Tuesday as they were embarrassingly defeated 4-0 by Hungary in the Nations League. Roland Sallai scored a double, Zsolt Nagy added a third and Daniel Gazdag grabbed a fourth to ensure the Three Lions would remain rooted to the bottom of Group C with just two points from four matches. Here are Express Sport's player ratings for the encounter... AARON RAMSDALE 6 The goal was hit hard but he will be disappointed it went in at his near post after hitting his arm KYLE WALKER 5 Seemed about the only England defender with any sort of poise in the first half, but badly at fault in second. JOHN STONES 5 His distribution was terrible, he was too slow to headers, set up the first Hungary goal and at fault for second. Sent off to cap off a miserable night. MARC GUEHI 6 Looked more tentative than in his other games and was unable to do much with the ball going forward. REECE JAMES 7 Set up an early chance for Bowen but needed a better understanding with the players in front of him JUDE BELLINGHAM 6 Perhaps the season is finally catching up with his young legs but did not seem to have his usual zip. KALVIN PHILLIPS 7 Some uncompromising tackles in midfield but to little avail and gave ball away for second goal. CONOR GALLAGHER 6 Some bright sparks and always like to surprise a Hungarian defender but not enough end product. BUKAYO SAKA 6 Slightly tepid tonight and got dragged into too much confusion down the left flank. Lacked his usual silkiness. HARRY KANE 6 His air shot led directly to the Hungary goal while at the other end he did not manage to get involved enough. JARROD BOWEN 7 Eager as ever, but as he showed running out of steam with his breakaway chance just a little bit short. SUBS RAHEEM STERLING (for Bowen ht) 6 MASON MOUNT (for Gallagher 56) 6 PHIL FODEN (for Bellingham 56) 6 HARRY MAGUIRE (for Saka 85) n/a
