Zawe, 37, showcased her bump last night at the premiere of her new film, Mr Malcolm's List in New York. The London native looked radiant in a stunning, embellished dress which flowed over her baby bump as she walked the red carpet at the glitzy event. Also visible was the star's dazzling engagement ring which she paired with silver earrings. Zawe and Tom's happy news comes weeks after they announced their engagement. The Marvel character, 41, confirmed the news to the LA Times, saying that he's "very happy".
