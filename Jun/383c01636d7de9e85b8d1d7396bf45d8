The incident at the Stadium of Light is alleged to have happened at around 10pm when a man was stood outside the ground's main reception and Sunderland club shop. The man, in his 40s, reportedly got into a verbal argument with a man and woman. The man in his 40s was then allegedly assaulted by the other man - suffering multiple injuries that have been described as serious. The alleged victim was taken to hospital where he still remains, reports Chronicle Live. A 38-year-old man was arrested in connection with the assault and has since been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He is next due to appear at Newcastle Crown Court next month.  Enquiries are ongoing into the circumstances surrounding the assault, and police are now appealing for anybody who witnessed it to come forward. Detective Constable Melissa Mcleod, of Northumbria Police, said: "This is clearly a serious incident that has resulted in a man being taken to hospital with head injuries. "The incident unfolded in a busy location just outside of the ground and our enquiries lead us to believe that it was witnessed by a number of people. "We are asking those individuals who think they witnessed a serious assault, or any events that may have led to an assault, after the concert last Saturday to get in touch with us. "Your information, no matter how insignificant you feel it may be, could prove the key to our ongoing investigation. "A man has since been charged and is due to appear in court in relation to this incident. "As a result, I would ask that everyone refrains from any speculation – both in the community and on social media – that could jeopardise those live proceedings." Anyone with information is asked to contact police via the "Tell Us Something" page of the Northumbria Police website or by calling 101 quoting crime number 065655F/22.
