   Oti flaunted her toned physique in her stunning new creations. The Dancing On Ice judge described how she once wept over her size at a Strictly fitting, as she was self-conscious of her 28GG chest. “I was crying,” she said. "I was like, I look so massive compared to the other girls,” she added, according to The Sun.  Oti looks stunning in a number of new snaps to promote her lingerie line. One picture shows the dancer in a black lace ensemble with a white jacket tied around her waist. Another photo sees Oti in a flattering brown matching bra and pants with a subtle floral pattern. One more shows the star in a bright orange set as she casually drapes a shirt around her.
