State broadcaster CCTV reported Xi as saying during a call with Vladimir Putin that China was “willing to continue to offer mutual support [to Russia] on issues concerning core interests and major concerns such as sovereignty and security”. But reports of the call drew a stinging riposte from the US. A State Department spokesman said: “Nations that side with Vladimir Putin will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. “China claims to be neutral, but its behaviour makes clear that it is still investing in close ties to Russia.” Washington is “monitoring China’s activity closely”, it was said.
