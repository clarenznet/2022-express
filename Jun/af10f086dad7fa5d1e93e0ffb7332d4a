Reach For The Moon, a three-year-old horse trained by John Gosden, 71, has seen his odds shorten from 11-4 a little over a week ago to a 4-5 favourite with Ladbrokes. The bay colt emerged victorious in two races in 2021 when Italian jockey Frankie Dettori, 51, placed first in Newbury and Sandown Park. Mr Dettori finished in second-place last month when Reach For The Moon returned to Sandown Park after a nine-month break.
