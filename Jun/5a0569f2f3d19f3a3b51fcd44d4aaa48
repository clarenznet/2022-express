A whopping £14m is up for grabs during tonight’s EuroMillions draw. Last week one lucky UK ticket holder won almost £55m with the lottery game. But could you be walking away a winner tonight? Camelot announced last Friday that one lucky individual had scooped a total of £54,957,242.50, by matching all seven numbers. The news comes shortly after a record-breaking EuroMillions prize draw was claimed, last month, by a single UK-based ticket holder. A mega £184,262,899.10 was won, instantly making that person the UK’s biggest ever National Lottery winner. An anonymous ticket-holder previously held the record after banking £170m in October 2019.

Players have until 7.30pm on the day of the draw to buy their ticket and enter the jackpot. The National Lottery website sells tickets at £2.50 each for UK residents, who can also purchase them from a number of venues, such as post offices and supermarkets.  On non-draw days, players can buy tickets for the EuroMillions between 6am and 11pm. Five main draw numbers and two lucky stars are all that’s needed to walk away with the money. Players can opt to either choose their regular numbers or take a chance on the EuroMillions Lucky Dip. So is your luck in for tonight’s EuroMillions? Read on to find out the winning numbers.

And the lucky stars are 03 and 11. Just five numbers and one lucky star will be enough to claim £130,554.30, while five main draw numbers alone are worth £13,561.20. Prizes gradually get lower in value all the way down to a ticket which has correctly guessed two main draw numbers.  Players from the UK must be aged at least 18 or over to play. If nobody finds a winning ticket, then the total jackpot will roll over to the next draw, and so on until a winner is found. The EuroMillions jackpot cap is set at 230m euros, after it was increased last October. Originally, the competition was launched on February 7, 2004, by France's Française des Jeux, Spain's Loterías y Apuestas del Estado and the United Kingdom's Camelot.
