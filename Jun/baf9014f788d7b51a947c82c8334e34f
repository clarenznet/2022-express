The American, 18, became the youngest player to reach a Major final since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004 by beating Martina Trevisan 6-3 6-1. And the teenager then sent out her political message following the shooting of 19 children and two teachers in a Texas school last week. Gauff told the Tennis Channel: "For me it is important to use the platform I have. Especially since I am in Europe. Yes it is a problem that has been going on a lot. I can't even say now. It has been going on for years in the US and I wanted to bring attention to it. "I know how many people are watching that match so maybe some global attention to what is going on in the US. We definitely need some change and reform regarding that aspect. “Ever since I was young, you guys know I use my platform to bring attention to topics and today was one of those days." Andy Murray said earlier this week that the shooting in Uvalde made him “angry” and a survivor’s account of the incident was similar to his own experience in the 1996 Dunblane massacre in Scotland. The Texas attack, 10 days after a shooting in Buffalo, New York that left 10 people dead, has intensified the longstanding national debate over US gun laws. “It’s unbelievably upsetting and it makes you angry,” the Scot told the BBC. "I think there’s been over 200 mass shootings in America this year and nothing changes. I can’t understand that. “My feeling is that surely at some stage you do something different. You can’t keep approaching the problem by buying more guns and having more guns in the country. I don’t see how that solves it. “But I could be wrong. Let’s maybe try something different and see if you get a different outcome.” Naomi Osaka supported the Black Lives Matter movement during her run to the 2020 US Open title and wore a new face mask in each round bearing the name of a black victim of alleged police or racist violence in the USA.
