Strutting towards the Heart FM studios this morning, the mother of two stunned in the summery get up. Amanda cut a smart figure in a ruffled bright pink shirt which she opted to wear without a bra. She paired the bright design with an even more colourful maxi-skirt which featured a multi-coloured print. The radio host finished off her glam look with a pair of sky-high, hot pink stilettos, oversized black sunglasses and heaps of gold jewellery. Amanda also showed off her outfit of the day with her 1.8 million Instagram fans while posing up a storm in the Heart FM studio.
