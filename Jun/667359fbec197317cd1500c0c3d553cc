During Olivia Rodrigo’s Saturday set at Glastonbury, the pop star was joined by Lily Allen for a rendition of Lily’s 2009 hit F**k You. Olivia dedicated the song to the US Supreme Court after it overturned a ruling in 1973, known as the Roe v Wade case, which made abortion legal across the US. Bringing Lily on stage, Olivia introduced: “I’m devestated and terrified [by the ruling] and so many women and girls are going to die because of this and I wanted to dedicate this next song to the five members of the Supreme Court who showed us at the end of the day they truly don’t give a s*** about freedom.” The performance was omitted from the BBC’s highlight coverage on iPlayer. However, the explicit rendition was uploaded to YouTube. Glastonbury fans were furious with the BBC for censoring the highlights of Olivia’s set and took to Twitter to complain.

Wild. #Glastonbury #pleaseputitback.” “So the BBC have edited out the whole of Lily Allen’s guest spot in Olivia Rodrigo’s set when honestly their F**k You to the US Supreme Court was so joyous that everyone should see it #Glastonbury,” @elizabennet3 commented. @jlb26_ remarked: “BBC very badly editing Olivia Rodrigo’s Glastonbury set to exclude her performing fuck you with Lily Allen … yeah it’s not a good look given the message behind the performance.” @hadleypch asked.@hadleypch asked: “@bbcglastowhy have you censored the Olivia Rodrigo Lilly Allen collaboration? “You really should be ashamed if you're not going to broadcast it. Or am I missing something? #oliviarodrigo #lilyallen #bbc #Glastonbury.” @MarkGComedyUK fumed: “BBC One and BBC iPlayer are f*****g cowards for editing out Olivia Rodrigo singing F**k You with Lily Allen and rightfully dedicating it to the Supreme Court justices. #Glastonbury.” Express.co.uk has contacted the BBC for comment.

Phoebe Bridgers led the crowd in charts of “f**k the Supreme Court” on Friday. The American singer who recently opened up on having an abortion last year, stopped her performance to speak to the crowd. “It’s super surreal but I’m having the s****iest time. Are there any Americans here? “Who wants to say, ‘F**k the Supreme Court?’ One, two… F**k the Supreme Court.” Meanwhile, during her headline set, Billie Eilish said: “Today is a really dark day for women in the US.” Before performing her song Your Power, she added: “I’m just gonna say that because I can’t bear to think about it any longer in this moment.” Glastonbury coverage is available on BBC iPlayer.
