TV presenter Stacey Dooley, 35, added a splash of colour to a dreary day at Wimbledon, wowing in a pink cropped shirt teamed with high-waisted leather trousers. She added strappy heels and sunglasses to her spectator ensemble. The documentary filmmaker stepped out with beau Kevin in a joint appearance, which has become more rare for the couple lately due to how busy their careers are. Kevin teamed a white polo shirt with tan trousers as the pair headed inside. Their celebrity pal Rochelle Humes was typically glam in a black dress with cut-out detailing, showing off her trim figure. She followed Stacey's lead with chic heels while carrying a Chanel bag. The This Morning star took the rainy weather into account with a smart black blazer draped around her shoulders while her dapper husband held an umbrella over their heads.
