Nadiya Bychkova, 32, stood out from the crowd as she joined a string of Strictly hunks for a theatrical extravaganza. The blonde beauty, who is dating her Strictly co-star Kai Widdrington, will join professional dancers Graziano di Prima, Pasha Kovalev and Nikita Kuzmin on stage. Also taking part will be Karim Zeroual, who made it all the way to the Strictly final back in 2019 without having had any formal dance training beforehand. Nadiya posed alongside her male dance companions in a sexy all-black ensemble, featuring a thigh-skimming skirt that showed off her long and slender legs. Having already wowed fans at the London Palladium, the next step is to take the tour up and down the country, with Nadiya in tow. Tonight the show hits Portsmouth's Guildhall, with subsequent tour date locations including Kent, Nottingham, London and more.
