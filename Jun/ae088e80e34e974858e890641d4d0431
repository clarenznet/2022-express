Mariah Carey, 53, looked sensational as she was seen leaving the cinema with Bryan Tanaka, 39, after watching the new romantic comedy, Bros, in New York. The We Belong Together and Fantasy hitmaker slipped into a black sequin-covered mini dress, and a pair of tall black stilettos. Her dress was emblazoned with the word "BROS" in gold lettering to show her support for the movie. She accessorised with black tights, large black shades, and a Pride-themed rainbow coloured sequin jacket over her shoulder. Bryan, meanwhile, cut a cool figure in a bomber jacket and jeans as he walked hand in hand with his girlfriend. The loved-up pair met when Bryan was a backup dancer for Mariah.
