Monica Bellucci, 57, looked incredible in a risqué dress during the premiere of Irreversible at the 55th Cannes Film Festival. The Italian actress posed up a storm as she showed off her black satin gown that featured a waterfall ruffle that went all the way down to the floor. The dress, which accentuated Monica’s figure, featured straps that held it together at either side and at the front and back. To go with the daring look, Monica chose to style her auburn locks in a half up bun - complete with a straight fringe.
