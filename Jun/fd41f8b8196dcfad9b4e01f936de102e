Many have raised concerns about year six students' readiness because of the pandemic disruptions, citing fears over behaviour and academic skills. Most teachers said they thought the intake will not be socially or emotionally ready to start secondary school. Seven in 10 said their school was organising extra support for incoming starters to address learning gaps. The survey of more than 1,000 teachers, commissioned by GL Assessment and carried out by YouGov, found 75 percent were concerned the new Year Sevens will not be academically prepared. Some 71 percent of primary teachers said SATs would be less reliable this year. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: "The findings show that school leaders and teachers have deep concerns for pupils making the transition this year, both in terms of the impact of the disruption to their learning and their emotional and social preparedness. "This reflects what our own members have been telling us, particularly in relation to the pastoral support that leaders are finding huge demand for across all key stages."  He added that the findings also highlighted the proactive work schools were doing to address these issues. Mr Barton added: "It illustrates the determination leaders and teachers have for ensuring that these children have the best possible start to their secondary education." Crispin Chatterton, of GL Assessment, said: "Schools are going above and beyond to tackle any consequences of the pandemic. "But we shouldn't be under any illusions that this year's transition to secondary school will be anything other than challenging."
