All school-aged children and young people who arrive in England from Ukraine have the right to access suitable education and childcare. The nursery offers professional, registered childcare for children under five, but it does come at a cost. Children aged three and four-year-olds in England can get 15 hours of free childcare per week. Parents who are working could receive an extra 15 hours to make up to 30 hours of funded childcare per week. To qualify, a single parent or both parents in a couple must earn at least the minimum equivalent of 16 hours a week at the national minimum wage or national living wage. There are no criteria or a need to apply, but you will need to find a nursery near you. To do this, you can use the Government’s online tool which will search for nearby childcare settings. You can open the link here on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. It is a trusted website and is safe to use. Just type in the postcode of the accommodation you are staying in and click the green button. This will take you to a new window with a green button. Click on this to open your local council website. A new website will open with options on the screen. Select the one that says ‘providers offering free childcare places for three and four-year-olds’. If you are given the option while searching, tick ‘day nursery’, type out your postcode into the box again, and select a mile range you are willing to travel. You should also check the ‘offers free entitlement’ box. All of the local nurseries with space for new children should appear. You can contact them directly using the phone number shown next to the nursery's name. Once you have chosen a nursery local to you, you will need to supply them with your child's passport, birth certificate, or any proof of ID if available.
