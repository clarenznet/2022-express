Geri Halliwell, 49, took to Instagram yesterday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II as she celebrated 70 years of reign and service. The special Platinum Jubilee post featured Geri’s bandmates waiting in line for Her Majesty to greet them. The glowing monarch could be seen holding a bouquet of flowers as she shook Ginger Spice’s hand in the unearthed photograph. Geri dazzled in a sparkly white dress which featured a sweetheart cleavage and spaghetti straps. The Queen looked regal as ever in a bright yellow short-sleeved dress, which she paired with white gloves and a pearl necklace. In the post’s caption, Geri commended the Queen for her “inspirational leadership” in view of her 1.2 million followers. She typed: “HRH, our Queen ‘s 7O years of service and inspirational leadership.”
