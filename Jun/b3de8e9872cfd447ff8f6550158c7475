The news that it now costs £100 to fill up the family car is yet another hammer blow in the cost of living crisis. The soaring price of fuel at the pumps means that the cut in duty the Chancellor announced in his Spring Statement has barely made a ripple. Prices have outstripped that token gesture and done nothing to help the people struggling most. When the Government made its announcement, petrol was ‘only’ 167p a litre, and diesel was just under 180p. With prices way above that, the 5p reduction has long been cancelled out. We warned at the time that only seven percent of the savings from cutting fuel duty would go to the poorest fifth of households – while one-third would go to the richest fifth. Prices at the pump were already rising before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and, clearly, that has just made matters worse. High fuel prices have also impacted businesses and this has had a further knock-on effect on the cost of living. In a recent report, the Road Haulage Association stated: "Fuel represents over a third of a truck's operating costs, yet profit margins are between 1% and 2%....every penny increase makes a massive difference’.    In addition to this, the recent red diesel rebate taxation on April 1 - questionably designed to reduce emissions - has meant affected businesses like construction have experienced fuel cost rises of more than 50 percent, and that’s above the already raised prices of fuel. The rise in business costs not only threatens companies’ survival, but ultimately results in higher product prices across the board adding further to financial pressure to the public. The government’s strategy to deal with the cost-of-living and climate crisis have been questionable, contradictory and largely ineffective. A great deal of rethinking is required.
