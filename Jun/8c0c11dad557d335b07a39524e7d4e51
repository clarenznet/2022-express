Eamonn Holmes has been soaking up the atmosphere in Hyde Park as he watched the Rolling Stones perform. The former This Morning host could be seen with two female companions helping him to walk amid his agonising battle with chronic back pain. One of the friends helping the 62-year-old along was Saira Khan, who used to work with his wife Ruth Langford on Loose Women. He was also asissted by another female friend as well as using the walking stick he is sometimes seen with. Yesterday, Ruth, who was also in tow to watch Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, posted a gushing tribute to Eamonn on their 12th wedding anniversary.
