The Platinum Jubilee parade is underway, with throngs of crowds filling the pavements in Central London and The Mall, hoping to get a glimpse of the action. The annual military parade marks the beginning of the celebrations, and will be followed by the Trooping the Colour. This is especially exciting for royal fans as they get a chance to glimpse the family out in force on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Many others have opted for the relevant comfort of nearby St James's Park, which boasts huge screens for revellers to watch the events on. Millions of Britons are making the most of the four-day bank holiday, a specially lengthened weekend specifically for the Jubilee. It is intended to allow them to pay their respects to the monarch and celebrate her 70 years on the throne, a record-breaking figure and a first in British royal history. Since the four-day bank holiday was announced, many have called for a permanent bank holiday going forward to remember the jubilee. Business leaders, like Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden and ITV’s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, launched campaigns asking the Government to consider the wider benefits of turning the additional public holiday into an annual fixture. And others, like the Confederation of British Industry, Hospitality UK and the archbishop of Canterbury, backed a Friday June 3 'thank holiday' repeated every year. However, in April, the Government appeared to put a dampener on the hopes after No 10 said it was not likely to back the proposal. So, what do YOU think? Should the jubilee always be a bank holiday in the UK? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
