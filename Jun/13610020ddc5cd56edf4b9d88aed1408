Gary Lineker warded off the embarrassment of being caught short on camera at the World Cup 1990 by simply quipping: "Who hasn't?" The video footage was 32 years old, but, thanks to the Match of the Day star's celebrity status, it was unearthed again on Twitter this morning. @Fanzine_com narrated: "32 years ago today, England faced Ireland at Italia '90 and Gary Lineker suffered the 'most horrendous experience' of his playing career..." The account didn't save his blushes when they chose to tag him in their post, adding: "We'll leave you to fill in the blanks @GaryLineker." Though he could have chosen to ignore it, Gary quickly wrote back, quipping: "Oh come on, who hasn’t s**t themselves in a World Cup game?" "Loads probably but not many have wiped their a*** on the grass so everyone else gets covered in it," fired back @Steven13644104. READ NOW: Julie Andrews hasn't aged a day but Sound of Music kids unrecognisable Gary has previously discussed the mishap publicly, admitting that he had been struggling with a stomach issue at the time. He told of how he was suffering "terrible cramps" but opted to soldier on through the match. "You know, it’s the World Cup, you cannot say ‘Excuse me, ref, is it alright if I pop off for five minutes?’" he reasoned. Then, some wrong footing while in pursuit of the ball led to him "stumbling" - and the shock of his footwork led the shame-faced star to lose control of his bowels. In quotes published by the Sun, he continued: "As I stumbled, I... relaxed. I remember Gary Stevens coming up to me and he’s looking over me saying ‘Are you alright?’" "I just remember saying: ‘I’ve s*** myself!' What do you do?" Gary has also shuddered in the past while recalling needing to rub himself on the ground "like a dog". He confessed that he was desperate to leave the pitch when the accident happened, but could not bring himself to let his team down. DON'T MISS...

Were you feeling rough? Did the oppo [opposition] notice? When did you get to clean up?" @Laird_NathanIRE responded: "He had a virus, which led to him s***ting himself... It happens!" Then @648_Ben took the opportunity to make a political jibe, joking of Gary's sudden out-pouring: "You must have been thinking of a Labour government in charge of the economy at the time." @lilali1982 chuckled that he could have found himself a winning technique, quipping: "It's a great tactic though. Who wants to tackle the guy who just s**t himself?!?!" @jmothecat mused: "Everyone’s s**t themselves at some point in their lives. Very few have played World Cup matches." He added: "If someone told me ‘you can play for your country in a World Cup game, the downside is you will have to s**t yourself’ I’d take that deal." The response from fans was largely sympathetic, although some followers ribbed him over the accident, with @SchadenThings claiming: "These days [the s**t] mostly comes out of your mouth and Twitter feed."
