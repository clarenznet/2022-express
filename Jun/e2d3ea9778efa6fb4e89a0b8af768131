I realise something has to be done about the situation but think the blame lies with Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has never had it under control from day one. Surely the answer is to return them to the country they left prior to arriving in the UK. They could have made requests for asylum there. While it's difficult to predict what will happen with these disputes, this is not the 1970s, when a larger percentage of workers were unionised and members carried out what the leaders demanded, says Barrie Warren, from Bury, Lancs. Yes there will be some disruption but the loony Lefties no longer hold the power they once did. So let's appeal instead to the common sense of the workers who are far more realistic than their union bosses. The Government's proposals to alter the Northern Ireland Protocol are in the best interests of the UK, the EU, and Northern Ireland itself. But the stubborn head-bangers flouncing around the EU are, as usual, seeing problems where they don't exist, says Ashley Smith, from March, Cambs. They are having a toys and pram moment, and relishing siding with Republicans to attack anything that is British. Why is there so much fuss and criticism of Prince Charles's comments about flying illegal migrants to Africa?, asks Geoff Manning, from Lower Kingswood, Surrey. It was apparently made during private chats which someone decided to make public. I happen to disagree with him but everyone, even the heir to the throne, is entitled to have a private opinion on any subject. It is not as if he made a big announcement. I see Nicola Sturgeon is launching a new campaign for independence, on the basis that the rest of the UK is holding back Scotland's potential, says Richard Gunn, from Whickham, Tyne and Wear. Great, let's vote in England. No more UK cash and it launches its own currency. Care to bet on how long before it is bankrupt?
