The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will scrap its requirement for travellers to present a negative Covid test before entering the US, according to a senior administration official. Currently, only vaccinated travellers can enter the United States. All passengers must present a negative COVID-19 test. Non-vaccinated travellers are still not allowed to visit the country. It is believed the new rule will come into effect at midnight on Sunday, CNN reported.

The Biden administration is expected to announce the new measure on Friday, June 10. Travellers have been required to present a negative COVID-19 test to enter the US since January 2021. Travel industry officials and airlines had been critical of the rule for months and urged Biden to scrap the measure. To enter the US, British tourists can show their NHS Covid pass as proof of vaccination. At the time of writing, tourists who aren't fully vaccinated are not allowed to enter the US. Mark Crossey, Skyscanner’s US Travel Expert, commented: "This news will go a long way towards boosting confidence and removing complexity for travellers who are hoping to visit loved ones overseas or book a holiday to the US in 2022. The US has featured high on UK travellers' wish lists throughout the pandemic, and the most popular locations like New York and Los Angeles were often featured in the top searched destinations even when borders were closed with people dreaming of their next trip across the pond. "The recent change in rules will drive long-term and long-haul trip planning, and we expect to see searches and bookings for the remainder of 2022 and into next year continuing to grow."
