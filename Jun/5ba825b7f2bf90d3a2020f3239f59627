Similar to Premium Bonds, the Halifax monthly draw is available to savers with over £5,000 put aside in the high street bank. An estimated 1,600 customers could win between £100 and £100,000 this month.  The Savers Prize Draw has seen Halifax give away over £75million in prizes since 2011. To be eligible for the draw, savers must: Savers will need to hold a minimum of £5,000 for a whole calendar month to be entered into the following month’s prize draw. The £5,000 can be combined across multiple qualifying accounts or held in a single Halifax savings account. Additionally, some Bank of Scotland branded personal retail savings accounts also qualify for the prize draw. Savers can register for the draw even if they don’t have the £5,000 saved up just yet. They will then be entered into the draw once they have amassed enough savings. All of Halifax’s savings accounts and cash ISAs are eligible for the draw, except for accounts for kids. People with joint savings accounts will have their savings split equally for the draw. However, joint account holders need to register for the draw separately. Savers can register through a variety of methods including: Savers only need to register once and will be automatically entered into every following monthly draw that they qualify for. Unlike Premium Bonds, savers in the running for the Halifax prize draw will still benefit even if they don’t win. As the savings are in traditional savings accounts they earn interest regardless of the prize draw results. Conversely, Premium Bonds offer a bigger jackpot of £1million but no interest on any savings held in the bonds.
