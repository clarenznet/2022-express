There's a very simple way to save money on your broadband bill and it's especially enticing for anyone who loves BT. UK mobile network EE has just announced a major sale event which, along with the usual iPhone and SIM-only deals, also includes reduced prices for its internet services. You might not be aware that BT now owns EE after buying the firm back in 2016 and the telecoms giant actually powers EE's broadband network. This new sale means you can get that BT-powered broadband for a much cheaper price than BT itself can currently offer. In fact, if you use EE's mobile network you can grab a deal which includes 36Mbps broadband for £24 per month which is around £4 cheaper than an identical plan from BT. There are also faster 70Mbps downloads from EE which starts from £27 - that's a £4 saving over BT. As well as offering those cheaper prices there's more good news as those with an EE-powered phone will also get an extra 5GB of data added to their plan when they take out broadband with the firm.

A home with one person simply checking emails and surfing the web should easily cope with 36Mbps downloads. However, start adding more devices and extra family members downloading movies and PS5 games and you'll want something a lot faster. Most firms including BT, Virgin and EE now offer full Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) and it's worth checking if this technology is now on your street as it boosts your downloads to speeds in of 500Mbps - that's fast enough to download a full HD movie in under a minute.
