For a moment I thought our Prime Minister, under pressure as he is, would do the right thing by Northern Ireland. No such luck. The new Bill on the Northern Ireland Protocol literally does NOTHING. As I pored over it I was at first heartened by what it said. The Act of Union to be upheld, EU State Aid laws, VAT and Excise duty rates to be jettisoned. And, vitally, the European Court of Justice to be removed as the supreme arbiter of the agreement. Then I got to the last clause of the Bill which states that only its last six clauses will pass into law. All the good stuff trotted out earlier in the Bill (designed to keep people like me happy) would have NO operative effect. They are in the Bill for decorative purposes. So what do these last six clauses say? Well, one of them, as I have mentioned, states that only six clauses pass into law. So that leaves five. Of these, one authorises Government to incur expenditure in implementing the Act and another is a list of definitions. The last three describe how new regulations can be made once the Bill passes into law. In summary, they state the Government may itself pass statutory instruments and implement these UNLESS a past act of Parliament is being varied â€“ in which case the regulation must be subject to an affirmative procedure i.e. be put to Parliament. Errr, is this not how much of Government business is already done? The fact is, the new Bill is toothless. It is to Brexiteers and unionists nothing more than virtue signalling. An attempt to distract us while the Government kicks the can down the road. Any genuine changes to the Protocol would have to go through a completely new Parliamentary process. This Bill does not advance the cause of British citizens in Northern Ireland, or the union of Northern Ireland with Great Britain. Boris Johnson has bottled it - AGAIN.
