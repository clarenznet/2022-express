The 13-year-old girl was dashed to hospital after the sickening abuse. Her mother said she is disgusted with "vicious bullies" who targeted the child at Hilltown Disco, a youth event in County Down, Northern Ireland on Friday, June 17. The youngster was left with head injuries after she was attacked by five girls. As the girl was taken to hospital she kept "dropping in and out of consciousness" and now has a concussion and black eyes, her mother claims. The teenager is badly shaken and nervous to leave her home following the incident, reports Belfast Live. Her mother said: "This was the fourth time that my daughter has been to the disco in Hilltown and the previous three times were great and she had a wonderful time. "On Friday while she was at the disco with a friend, a group of girls who she did not know suddenly attacked her and started kicking her about. "Her friend ended up running outside screaming for help. "My daughter has been left terrified by what has happened to her and was screaming and crying out while she was on her way to the hospital with her cousin, all while fading in and out of consciousness. "It is disgusting that my daughter has went out for a nice night to have fun with a friend only to be set upon by vicious bullies. "If her cousin was not outside to pick her up nobody would have known who she was or who her next of kin were after she was attacked. "I am just thankful that she made it to the hospital in the end." A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesperson said: "Police received a report of an assault on a female in the Rosstrevor Road area of Hilltown shortly after midnight on Saturday 18 June. Enquiries are ongoing."
