Rocco Ritchie looked spectacular in a dark brown suit paired with an eye-catching bright yellow shirt and sunglasses, which he paired with 1950s-style loafers and a pair of sunglasses. Guy Ritchie's son seemed to have been embracing a vintage rocker style as he attended Montblanc's On The Move event in the French capital. At 21, Rocco is Madonna's eldest child - and he has now revealed himself as an expressionist painter. Since Rocco, who had been selling his work under the name Rhed, was outed as an artist by Page Six earlier this year, Madonna, 63, has shared her appreciation for his work on her Instagram account. However, the video and photo footage she shared was posted amid a social media storm. The Material Girl's age-defying raunchy photo shoots have proved controversial with some of her 17.7 million followers, prompting a backlash in recent months.
