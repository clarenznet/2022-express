Judy star Renée Zellweger, 53, stunned with her youthful looks just weeks ago at the NBCUniversal Hosts FYC event for her new project, The Thing About Pam. The Bridget Jones’s Diary actress showcased her gloriously youthful complexion with a natural make-up look, featuring a blush lip. Renée did not seem to have aged a day from photos taken of her earlier on in her acting career, which saw her attend the 10th Annual IFP/West Independent Spirit Awards in one of her very first red carpet events as a budding Hollywood star. In unearthed pictures, Renée, who won the Best Actress gong at the Oscars for her portrayal of Judy Garland in 2020, sported very light make-up that incorporated a pop of colour, thanks to a bold burgundy lip.
