Frances Curley, from South Ayrshire, was on holiday on Inchtavannach Island in Loch Lomond when her two-and-a-half-year-old border terrier Skye vanished from the campsite last Sunday. A Facebook appeal said the partially-sighted dog was in a hammock while Ms Curley made dinner nearby at around 4.15pm on June 19. However, when Ms Curley looked at the hammock her beloved pet has disappeared. A search of the island was launched but there was no trace of Skye. Two paddle-boarders told Ms Curley they had witnessed two men take a little brown dog into a speed boat before leaving the island. Ms Curley said her vulnerable visually impaired pet is "scared of her own shadow". She said: “100 percent no doubt she was taken. "The island was searched twice. "She is scared of her own shadow. "When I was training her, I played hide and seek to test her, when she realised I was not in range of her, she would sniff her way back to where I was hiding - always.” Ms Curley is appealing for anyone with information to come forward. She is also asking the two men to get in touch so they can be ruled out of the search. Skye has been microchipped with the details registered to Ms Curley. She was wearing a pink and white striped collar with two tags, one which reads "fur ever yours", when she went missing. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We can confirm that enquiries are ongoing into the theft of a border terrier dog from the Loch Lomond area. “The theft took place on Inchmoan Island between 16.15 and 16.25pm on Sunday, 19 June. "Police are making enquiries locally and with the National Park Authority regarding a white speedboat possibly being used by persons involved in this theft." Anyone with information can contact police on 101, quoting incident 0213 of 20 June 2022. Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
