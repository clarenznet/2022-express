The Social Mobility Commission chairwoman is expected to say today: "We want to move away from the notion that social mobility should just be about the 'long' upward mobility from the bottom to the top - the person born into a family in social housing who becomes a banker or CEO. "We want to promote a broader view for a wider range of people who want to improve their lives, sometimes in smaller steps." That, she says, means "not just 'Wider view.' Ms Birbalsingh making elite pathways for the few, but by thinking about those who would otherwise be left behind." Speaking at an event hosted by think-tank Policy Exchange, Ms Birbalsingh will say there is no "one size fits all" model of social mobility.  She adds: "If a child of parents who were long-term unemployed, or who never worked, gets a good job in their local area, isn't that a success worth celebrating? "Would we really say it doesn't count as social mobility because they are not a doctor or lawyer?" Ms Birbalsingh, who set up Michaela Community School in north-west London, is known for controversial comments. In April, she was urged to apologise for saying girls shunned A-level physics because they disliked "hard maths."
