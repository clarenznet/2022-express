The campaigner - whose Bowelbabe fund has raised Â£6.7million for cancer research - revealed she was given "days, maybe a week to live" a month ago. She is receiving end-of-life care at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, but continues to defy doctors' expectations. Dame Deborah said: "As we all know, life doesn't go according to plan, so I'm just grateful for whatever extra time the powers that be have decided to grant me." She described the "gut instinct" moment she knew something was wrong before her bowel cancer diagnosis. The You Me And The Big C podcast star said she never dreamed she would live to see the show Embarrassing Bodies air on E4. But she watched Thursday's recorded programme. The 40-year-old told GP Dr Tosin Ajayi- Sotubo she realised there was a problem when she saw blood in her poo. Deborah added: "I had a change of habits. I started going to poo eight times a day. And I used to be a once-a-day kind of girl." She told viewers talking about poo should never be taboo, adding: "Let's smash those taboos because that is going to save lives."
