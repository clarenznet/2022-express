Nadia Sawalha, 57, took to Instagram to share a short video of herself poking fun at social media influencer, Sommer Ray. The influencer posed on a sunbed whilst on holiday in a barely-there bikini as she promoted skincare supplements. Nadia took to Instagram to share her own version, mocking celebrity culture. The Loose Women panellist shared the short video in view of her 516,000 Instagram followers as she took to her sunbed in a tiny string yellow bikini. After showing the clip of Sommer with her skincare gummies and matching bandana and bikini, viewers are left stunned when Nadia appears on the screen. She made her own makeshift white bandana and used pringles as her promotional product. Nadia captioned the video: "Me and @sommerray love to twin in the summer months !! We inspire each other … endlessly. "Ps that’s an HRT patch not a nicotine patch as some of you think." Other celebrities Nadia has mimicked include Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Halle Berry.
