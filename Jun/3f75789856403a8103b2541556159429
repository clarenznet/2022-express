As your leader says it would be a massive shot in the arm to the UK economy and would help the Chancellor during these challenging economic times. When the weather is fine this country has a lot to offer and some fabulous galleries, museums and stately homes etc when it isn't. My big fear is that the more popular our resorts become, the more businesses are likely to cash in and profiteer, as many did in the pandemic. They need to offer value for money. The obvious solution to the appeals against migrant deportation is to let these appeals be dealt with by the applicants after they arrive in Rwanda. We can ship the applicants' lawyers over there at the same time with their clients, and return any successful applicants back here, says John Beck, from Lewes, East Sussex. It would be a simple answer to the problem which should help to deter migrants from risking their lives crossing the Channel, which in turn will help put the smuggling gangs out of business.  I'm surprised to hear Boris single out manned ticket offices as the problem when as an ex-London Mayor he must know that it's the almost total absence of driverless trains, says Roy Daniels, from Luton, Beds. The taxpayer-funded £19bn state-of-the-art Crossrail gave the Government the opportunity of a lifetime to make it driverless from the outset, but instead employed 140 £62,000-a-year drivers working a four-day week for 18 months testing the trains, who will now join the strike. You couldn't make it up. The public are easily led by the media with regards to targeting the PM, says Neil Snow, from Eastleigh, Hants. The public should be looking at his drive to make the country better and what he can do with the public's support.They should look at the alternatives. A Labour Party will support any way to topple the Tories, while trade union strikes will be the norm. God help us if any other party gets in.
