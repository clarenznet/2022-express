Vasilka Stancheva was caught rumaging through the pensioner's handbag outside Oxford Circus station on Wednesday, June 15, at around 5.20pm by British Transport Police officers in plain clothing. At the time, the 22-year-old was wearing a leather jacket and blue hat - which she used to block the view of her right hand. Ms Stancheva stole the elderly woman's medicine, as well as her gold purse. The gold purse and medication were promptly returned to the victim. She was already on the radar of police officers after she was caught using the exact same tactic on another person when she lurked behind an elderly woman on Tottenham Court Road in the West End last month. Ms Stancheva was charged £369 for that offence, reports My London.    Within 24 hours of the medicine theft, Ms Stancheva, who lives on Sutherland Road in Edmonton, Enfield, north London, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court and was charged with attempted theft and sentenced to 28 days in jail. Sharon Turner, inspector of the Priority Crime Taskforce said: "It’s a common tactic for pickpockets to use bags, umbrellas and any clothing to block people’s view as they root around the belongings of an unaware victim. "These criminals operate in large crowds, often close to major stations, and look to steal from anyone they believe is distracted. "We have plain-clothed officers regularly patrolling across London who are trained to spot this suspicious behaviour. "For the public, simply just being wary that thieves are operating can make their job that much harder and help us tackle this offending." Earlier this year, London was named the pickpocketing hotspot of the UK, with over 80,000 thefts taking place in the capital in just two years.
