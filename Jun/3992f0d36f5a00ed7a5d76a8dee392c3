Following Saudi Arabia raising crude sale prices in July, oil prices have spiked by more than $2 (£1.60) in early trade on Monday. This is thought to be an indication of the issues of oil supply despite OPEC+ agreeing to hasten its output rises over the next two months.  Brent crude futures increased by 1.5 percent or $1.80 (£1.44) to $121.52 (£97.25) per barrel at 11:19pm GMT following an intraday high of $121.95 (£97.60), increasing a 1.8 percent gain from Friday. The price of Brent Crude has slightly reduced after passing $124 (£99.24) per barrel previously in the week which was the highest level since March. The reduction will not impact consumers at petrol stations or help with inflation that is being felt across the globe.   The pandemic recovery combined with sanctions on Russian oil will continue to keep oil prices high, with a leading oil analyst warning that these prices are here to stay. Matt Smith, an oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler told CNN Business that “triple digit oil prices” are likely to stay. He added: “If Chinese demand comes roaring back after lockdowns and Russia continues to see production drop, then a retest of the high of $139 (£111.26) seen earlier this year is not beyond the realms of possibility.” READ MORE: ‘Humbled’ Queen inspired by nation’s kindness, joy and kinship  Meanwhile, US West Texas Intermediate crude futures have increased by 1.4 percent or $1.63 (£1.30) to $120.50 (£96.43) a barrel following a three-month high of $120.99 (£96.83). The contract gained 1.7 percent on Friday. According to Aramco (2222.SE), Saudi Arabia increased the official selling price for Arab light crude to Asia to a $6.50 (£5.20) premium compared to the average of the Oman and Dubai benchmarks, up from a premium of $4.40 (£3.52) in June. The spike came despite the announcement from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) that it would increase production in July and August by 50 percent more than planned to 648,000 barrels per day.

The move by OPEC+ has been seen by most as unlikely to rise enough to meet demand following member countries including Russia failing to boost output as demand in the US skyrockets and China eases lockdowns. Commonwealth Bank analyst Vivek Dhar said: "While that increase is sorely needed, it falls short of demand growth expectations, especially with the EU's partial ban on Russian oil imports also factored in.”
