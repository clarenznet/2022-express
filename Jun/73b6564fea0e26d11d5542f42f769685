Jelena Djokovic, 36, gave her reigning champion husband Novak Djokovic, 35, a supportive smile today ahead of his match against Kwon Soon-Woo at Wimbledon. Wearing a brown tracksuit, Jelena could be seen beaming as she ran her hands through her long, straight brunette locks. The childhood sweethearts have been married since 2014, and share two children, Stefan, born in 2014 and Tara, born in 2017. For more than a decade, the family have resided in Monaco. Jelena is the director of the Novak Djokovic Charity Foundation which aims to enhance the Serbian education system to improve the lives of children. Through the foundation, the couple have completed over 37 projects and have approximately 55 volunteers.
