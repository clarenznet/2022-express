The summer transfer window is developing at a relentless rate, with top sides from around Europe pulling out all the stops to strengthen ahead of the new season. Imminent moves are expected at Tottenham and Manchester United, while Chelsea and Arsenal are also attempting to pull strings as fans, managers and owners battle with the fear of getting left behind. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has already had a productive summer, delivering Antonio Conte three new faces and getting to work on more. As of Thursday, the Lilywhites are believed to be closing in on Barcelona's Clement Lenglet and Everton's Richarlison, which would sew up a hefty portion of their transfer business earlier than most. Arsenal and Man Utd are two sides who may have hoped for more progress based on the amount of recruits needed, and they are both trying to remedy that by chasing the same player. Ajax's Lisandro Martinez is the star in question, and a bidding war seems to have taken hold as the figures creep closer to the Dutch side's asking price. And Thursday could see yet more twists and turns involving Leeds United winger Raphinha. Barcelona, Chelsea and Arsenal are all believed to be in contention to sign the Brazilian, who is yet to make up his mind on where to go next. FOLLOW EXPRESS SPORT'S LIVE UPDATES BELOW...
