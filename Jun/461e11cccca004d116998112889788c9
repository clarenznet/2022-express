Staff will get the cash in August so they can shoulder “uncertain economic times”, an internal memo revealed. The payments are not for senior management or executives but will go to 64,182 – or 99.5 per cent – of the lender’s employees, reports state.  The memo read: “We’ve been assessing the evolving outlook for inflation and considering how we can support you… We’ll be making a one-off payment of £1,000 to all our people in grades A to G.” The Unite union last month protested outside Lloyds’ annual general meeting after members rejected the company’s latest pay offer. They slammed the firm’s handing of cash to shareholders through dividends at a time when inflation – which is due to rise to 10 per cent this year – is taking a toll on its lower-paid workers.
