Georgian commander Mamuka Mamulashvili has claimed thousands of Britons currently make up around 3,000 of the 20,000 foreign soldiers supporting the Ukrainian military. The news comes as two British fighters pleaded guilty to “undergoing training with the aim of carrying out terrorist activities” in a Russian kangaroo court. The supreme court of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) has sentenced Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner to death on charges of them going to war against Vladimir Putin's army as mercenaries. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she will do "whatever is necessary" to secure the release of the two captives. In another blow to Putin, Ukraine claims at least 250 Russian soldiers were killed in the conflict in the last 24 hours, taking the total estimated losses to 32,750. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
