The AA said domestic tourism will also miss out on millions of pounds as visitors heading to popular destinations spend more on petrol. Edmund King, the AA's president, said: "High streets are already reeling from families cutting back in this cost of living crisis. With soaring petrol costs, shop tills are haemorrhaging £23million a day to fuel. "Worse still, as the holiday season approaches, UK tourism will see millions of pounds of potential spending by visitors lost to higher petrol costs at forecourts along the way." The average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts reached a record 183.2p on Thursday, according to data firm Experian. That was an increase of 7.3p in just seven days. The average cost of filling a typical 55-litre family car exceeded £100 for the first time on Wednesday. The average price of a litre of diesel was also a record, at 188.8p. Mr King added: "We would urge drivers at the moment to cut out shorter car journeys if they are able to do so, and walk or cycle to save money. Crippling "Almost one fifth of AA members are already doing this. But by changing your driving style you can also save up to 15 per cent on fuel costs. These crippling fuel costs are hitting home so drivers need to take all the steps they can to stay mobile." Simon Williams, of the RAC, said it is "becoming clearer by the day that the Government must take further action to reduce the enormous financial burden on drivers". He added: "A temporary cut in VAT on fuel, or a deeper duty cut, are surely what is needed." Asked about the issue, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "We made a cut already, the biggest cut ever in fuel duty. "I want to see those cuts having an impact on the pumps. We are watching very closely to see what happens."
