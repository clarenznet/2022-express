The first deportations under the contentious deal are expected to happen next week after the High Court ruled on Friday that a flight taking asylum seekers to the east African country can go ahead. Migrants who arrive in Britain illegally face being deported to Rwanda, more than 4,000 miles away, under a deal struck by Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, in April.  According to The Times, a source heard the Prince of Wales expressing his opposition to the plans in a private conversation. The Prince, 73, is said to be particularly frustrated because he is due to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in the Rwandan capital Kigali this month. However, Clarence House spokesperson insisted that he had not tried to influence the Government. The spokesperson said: “We would not comment on supposed anonymous private conversations with the Prince of Wales, except to restate that he remains politically neutral.   “Matters of policy are decisions for Government.” This comes after the judge at the High Court refused to grant an injunction sought by campaigners to block the one-way flight to Rwanda next Tuesday. The campaign groups said they would appeal against the decision on Monday. More than 30 people who arrived in the UK illegally are due to be on the plane to Rwanda the following day.
