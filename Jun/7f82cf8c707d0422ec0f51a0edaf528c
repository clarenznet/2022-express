Brooke, 38, who played Kelly Taylor in EastEnders, shared an adorable snap of baby Ben, named after her brother, 16, who was stabbed to death on June 29, 2008. Little Ben Ross Boardley is Brooke's second baby with her husband, Simon Boardley, 43. She wrote: "A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away. Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud. I know it already." Friends and family congratulated the couple on Instagram. One post said: "A perfect gift to ease the pain of a day that took so much from you." Ben Kinsella was killed in Islington, north London, as he celebrated finishing his GCSEs. His death led to stricter sentences for knife crime. Three men were jailed for life in 2009 for his murder.
