Now could be a good time to check your monthly broadband bill and make the switch to something new. Virgin Media is currently trying to tempt users away from services such as Sky, BT and TalkTalk with the offer of much cheaper internet access and a new incentive that lets new customers sign up for free. First up let's talk about the speeds and price with Virgin currently offering a deal that's pretty hard to beat. Right now you can get 50Mbps downloads for £20 per month. As a quick comparison, Sky charges £25 for 36Mbps speeds and BT's entry-level 35Mbps downloads will set you back £26.99. If you fancy something even faster, then Virgin also has its 100Mbps service available for £24 per month or 200Mbps for just £28 - both of which are far cheaper than BT and Sky offer. As well as cutting costs in its Summer Sale event, there's more good news as Virgin has just announced that its scrapping its joining fee. Signing up to this Internet Service Provider (ISP) usually costs £35 but for a limited time you won't pay a penny. All of the deals available from Virgin require users to sign up for an 18-month contract.

All of the big Internet Service Providers (ISPs) including BT, Sky and Virgin Media have special bundles that are aimed at helping those who are financially vulnerable.

Ofcom recently warned that only 55,000 out of an estimated 4.2 million eligible households have signed up for a social tariff and those that haven't yet joined could be losing out.
