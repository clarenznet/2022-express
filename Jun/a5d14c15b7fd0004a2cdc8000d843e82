Despite his astounding career, he recently opened up and candidly revealed he was extremely "nervous" before singing at Princess Eugenie and Jack Brookbank's royal wedding. He told the Evening Standard he was "very good friends" with her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, and she had personally invited him to the service. Andrea revealed they met "a long time ago in a TV studio," and she handed him a "biography of her life." Bocelli claimed to have watched Eugenie and her sister, Princess Beatrice, growing up and was "very occasionally" a part of their lives. Speaking in 2018, he said: "I was a little bit in trouble with my voice. I was very tired. “I tried to warm my voice, I did my best. But in any case, I had some cough and phlegm. But, yes, I was nervous.” He said: “There is a way to live – I need to eat light. Of course, [I] don’t smoke and don’t drink. Things an athlete does. “The voice isn’t like a normal instrument that you can fix like a piano or violin.” Platinum Party at the Palace is available to watch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.
