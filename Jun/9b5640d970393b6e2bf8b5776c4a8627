David Hasselhoff, 69, and his wife Hayley Roberts, 42, looked sombre as they stepped out together in Paris at the weekend. Baywatch star David could be seen signing autographs for fans as he left a restaurant with his wife of four years. David looked casual in a blue shirt and green hat, while Hayley, who is 27 years his junior, wore a pink jumper dress that showed off her toned legs. The couple were also recently spotted together at the 61st Monte-Carlo Television Festival. In an interview in 2018, shortly after he tied the knot with Hayley, David admitted he had been concerned about their age gap. “For the longest time I didn't think it was right to marry Hayley as I was so much older and I didn't want to take away the fun and the youth and the excitement of growing old together and having children,” he told OK!. “We've been together for about seven years and we've had such a great time. I've realised how much I love Hayley and how much we've become part of each other's life.”
