  Phillip, 60, took to Instagram to share the cute family snap with his three million followers. “My girls are treating me to lunch,” Phillip wrote with the hashtag #fathersday. The photo was a selfie featuring Phillip with his daughters Molly, 29 and Ruby, 26 - but there was no sign of his wife Stephanie Lowe, who he married in 1993. The ITV presenter then shared some snaps of his food and a sweet clip of Molly as a little girl.
