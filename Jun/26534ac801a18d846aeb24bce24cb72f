A land home to my family since the late 1950s providing my inherent sense of affinity and belonging. For millions like me that was a journey shared, of making England our home as a warm and welcoming place of opportunity and prosperity. A country that daily provides millions like me a hand up to get going in life. The waves of immigration from around the Commonwealth which looked to the United Kingdom as a place of hope and freedom. The tens of thousands of Ugandan Indian refugees who this nation welcomed. A cross-Commonwealth voyage, including Priti Patel’s parents, driven by kinship, shared languages, shared history-heritage, and a unique affinity with England.Fast forward to last Friday – 444 illegal economic migrants, who paid thousands to organised criminal gangs, flee France and land on the Kent coast.This adds up to more than 11,000 such visa-dodging, dinghy-boarding, law-discarding irregular entrants this year. And this has meant the Government having to spend nearly £5 million every single day to accommodate people who have such brazenly zero regard for our entry laws, zero claim to be fleeing torture and hardship from France and with vast majority from societies with no shared values - almost zero prospect for meaningful integration into our free, democratic, liberal society.This means resources which should be channelled to places such as Jordan which houses hundreds of thousands genuine refugees are being spent on what is a complete mockery of our immigration system and an assault on our border at the hands of serious organised criminal gangs. And that is after having paid the French more than £50 million to deal with their complete breakdown of law and order with thousands of failed asylum seekers roaming the Calais jungle, trying their luck to cross the Channel by funding dangerous organised criminal gangs to be dispatched across to Kent in a dangerous dinghy.Therefore, just as the Germans have done with billions to Turkey, and in fact the EU has worked with – wait for it – Rwanda! The United Kingdom is absolutely right to do everything we can to discourage and deter this dangerous and vile trade in exploiting human misery. Of course, the assorted wokerati of the virtue-signalling, legal-illegal-migration-conflating, race-baiting merchants of division would have you believe Britain is some “hostile environment” and the Government’s Rwanda plan to stop this vile human trafficking exploiting such vulnerable people is “un-British” and “morally shameful”. Even “the opposite of the nature of God” as per the Archbishop of Canterbury – a contemptuous claim thoroughly demolished by Rwandan Archbishop, Laurent Mbanda.The truth is what is actually morally bankrupt and un-British is the mockery of the rule of law by encouraging irregular undocumented illegal entrants to simply land on our shores having passed through multiple safe countries. An affront to the concept of law and order where we have control of our borders, and a fair and balanced visa system controlling immigration.Now, every year Global Britain warmly welcomes hundreds of thousands aspirational immigrants who fill up long forms, queue up patiently from pillar to post at our visa centres, pay eye-watering sums to the Home Office, fulfil the stringent criteria of English language proficiency, whilst providing evidence of funds to support themselves when here in UK.Hundreds of thousands do this because they respect Britain as a bastion of fairness and goodness and choose to make Britain their home by doing the right thing.And it is with that sentiment – to join Global Britain and enjoy the fruits of a just and liberal society, the security and stability of a nation governed under the rule of law, and the endless opportunities afforded by our booming economy. And people around the world see how Global Britain has always risen to the occasion as a beacon of hope for refugees. Be it the evacuation of tens of thousands from Afghanistan or the warmth of the British people opening their homes as refuge for Ukrainian women, children and families fleeing violence and war or the easy path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of Hong-Kongers fleeing CCP tyranny.That is where we must do more – the rehabilitation and rejuvenation of war/socialism-stricken nations to help rebuild with security and stability so ordinary people are not made refugees in their own lands. Indeed, Global Britain can do even more to partner with the world’s leading contributor to UN peacekeeping – India. Why is that those who chant their virtue-signalling mantra of some magical “safe and legal routes” refuse to admit – the international displacement of persons from their homes and regions, is morally wrong and only serves to fatally gut communities already ravaged by the depredations of war and socialist despots.Ultimately, with the Home Secretary taking on the bigots denigrating the success story that is a resurgent Rwanda (hosting CHOGM this week), and the organised criminal gangs operating with impunity in France and the Britain-bashing racist hypocrites of the ECHR - this is about fairness, the rule of law, securing our borders, the protection of rights of millions of legal immigrants and to stop dinghy-chasing activist lawyers, their clientele and organised crime from gaming our generous immigration and asylum system that should serve Global Britain’s national interest as a global force for good to stand with those genuinely most in need, not those with a want to jump the queue.
