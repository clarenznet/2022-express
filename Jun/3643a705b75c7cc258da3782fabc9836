Lord Geidt said the situation frustrated him and he refused to deny reports, when quizzed by the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, that he considered quitting over the fixed penalty notice. The PM wrote to the peer saying any breach of the Covid rules at his 56th birthday gathering in the Cabinet room in 2020 was "unwitting". Lord Geidt yesterday told the committee: "I am glad the Prime Minister was able to respond to my report and in doing so addressed aspects of the things about which I was clearly frustrated."  He indicated he would not be launching an investigation into Mr Johnson even though he has now received greater powers to initiate his own inquiries.
