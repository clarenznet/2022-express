Jennifer Lopez, 52, turned heads as she put on a daring display as she oozed confidence in a black gown with sheer panels across her chest and hips. The age-defying beauty arrived at the premiere of her highly-anticipated Netflix documentary at the Tribeca Festival on Wednesday night. While her dress provided some coverage, the on-screen star flashed her cleavage as she opted to go braless in the sexy ensemble which displayed her visible curves. The mother-of-two looked radiant with her long brown hair slicked back in a sleek ponytail and a pair of glitzy drop earrings. She accessorised her look with a glossy pink lipstick, smokey grey eyeshadow, blush for a youthful glow and a black velvet clutch. The bride-to-be sported her 8.5-carat green diamond engagement ring, given to her by fiance Ben Affleck in April, and another diamond on her right middle finger.
