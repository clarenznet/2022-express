Officials said the outlay on the revamped nerve centre with a "curved catwalk" and extra interactive screens was "commercially confidential". It came days after the corporation blocked a Daily Express bid to find out how much licence payers cash went on a major rebranding exercise. It ducked a Freedom of Information request about its fees to consultants by claiming that making them public might harm future contract negotiations. After an appeal it then said it would take weeks to track down the information. Yesterday, the corporation revealed the new-look Studio B, which will host News at Six and Ten, as well as some political shows. Based at Broadcasting House, central London, it has introduced a catwalk to help guide viewers through complex stories. It also has a central tower to present graphics and visuals in a vertical format similar to a smartphone screen. There will also be a bigger weather map. Officials said a robotic camera system with tracks in the floor will allow the presenter to move more safely. TV anchor Huw Edwards said: "This gives us a platform which allows us to tell stories in a much more vibrant, creative and impactful way." "It will make a real difference to our audience. "We're really proud of it and I can't wait to share it with our viewers."
