The TUC said parents are now paying £185 more a month compared with 2010, when the Conservatives took office. The average annual bill for a family with a child under two was £4,992 in 2010, but last year this had increased to more than £7,200, said the union group. The UK now has some of the most expensive childcare fees in the developed world, it claimed. Childcare fees have “shot up”, while statutory maternity pay has fallen in value since 2010, said the organisation’s report. The TUC’s general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Childcare should be affordable for all but parents are spending a massive chunk of their pay packets on childcare bills, while their wages stagnate. “This is putting huge pressure on family budgets at the same time as other living costs are shooting up.” She added: “New mums are caught in a catch-22. “The UK’s miserly rate of statutory maternity pay means many are under financial pressure to return to work early and are then at the mercy of sky-high childcare fees. “We urgently need to get wages rising to stop households drowning in bills.” In a previous union survey one in three working parents with pre-school children revealed that they spent more than a third of their wages on childcare. The TUC estimated that parents with toddlers have to work 9.4 hours a week on average just to cover the cost of 25 hours of nursery care.
