It's the day of the Canadian Grand Prix (7pm start UK time) and there's plenty going on in the world of Formula One while we wait for lights out in Montreal. The ninth race of the season takes place later today with Max Verstappen on pole and the overwhelming favourite to claim victory for Red Bull.  Verstappen leads the Drivers' Championship by 21 points heading into round nine with team-mate Sergio Perez second in the standings. Ferrari suffered a double DNF in Baku last time out and so Charles Leclerc has dropped 13 points behind Perez. In Canada, it will be the Alpine of Fernando Alonso joining Verstappen on the front row after a brilliant qualifying performance on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton also had an enjoyable day and will start P4 - a season best - in the bouncing Mercedes. Carlos Sainz, Leclerc's Ferrari team-mate, is sandwiched between the pair as he looks to build some momentum again. The Spaniard has had some rotten luck this season which has stopped him from rivalling Leclerd and the Red Bull duo for the driver's title, at least until now. Perez starts 13th with Leclerc P19 and with Montreal an overtake-friendly circuit, we could be in for some real drama later today. Until then,Â Express Sport rounds up all the latest stories around the F1 paddock below.
