Red Arrow flights are a much-anticipated presence at most royal events, and the aircraft made no exception for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. They appeared several times over the long weekend as events across the country celebrated Queen Elizabeth II's 70th year on the throne. As the weekend comes to a close, they will attend a series of events across England. The Red Arrows made several Platinum Jubilee appearances and will make one last Buckingham Palace run, concluding the occasion this evening. The air bound acrobatic teams have three scheduled events for June 5, taking them across southern England and into the north. The events include the English Riviera Air Show, where they appear from 12.15pm, an Exeter to RAF Fairford run in the event at 4.19pm, and a final transit from Fairford to RAF Scampton from 7.37pm.
