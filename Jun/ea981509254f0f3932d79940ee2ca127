Sir Rod Stewart's daughter Renee Stewart celebrated her 30th birthday last week and took to her Instagram stories to share a black and white photo with her mum, Rachel Hunter, rocker dad and brother Liam Stewart. In the black and white photo, the four of them beamed at the camera as Renee placed her arm over her dad's shoulder. The former Sports Illustrated model celebrated daughter Renee's 30th birthday with son Liam at a dinner for family and friends in Beverly Hills. Renee told her Instagram followers: "Had the best time last week celebrating the lead up to my 30th. Thank you to everyone who made it so special. Last photo is me now currently sitting at home with Covid on my birthday. Thank you so much for the birthday wishes." Renee's dad, veteran rocker Sir Rod couldn't make the birthday dinner. He was committed to performing for the Queen for her Platinum Jubilee outside Buckingham Palace last weekend, but the family is looking forward to coming together this Tuesday when Rockin' Rod plays at the Hollywood Bowl.
