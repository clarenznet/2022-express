Kay Burley slipped into a plunging swimsuit as she confidently displayed her toned figure as she shared a series of photos on Instagram earlier this week. The 61-year-old was seen taking a dip outdoors in a photo which was taken as she spent her last days in Puerto Rico, where she had travelled to during her week-long break from hosting the news. Kay was all smiles in the candid photo and accessorised her look with a pair of sunglasses and a blue cap. “Until next time Puerto Rico,” the presenter captioned, in view of her 38,600 followers. Fans flocked to comment on the post, as Laura gushed: "Stunning." Gary wrote: "Wow Kay, you look amazing, hope you had a lovely time and have a safe trip home." Sallen added: "Beautiful pictures."
