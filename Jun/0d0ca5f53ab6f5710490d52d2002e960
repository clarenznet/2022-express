For best results, a tin sized approximately 20 x 30cm should work best. Next, combine butter, syrup and sugar in a saucepan and heat gently until ingredients melt. Once the ingredients have fully dissolved, stir in the last and mix well. Spoon your mixture into a prepared tin and smooth the surface using a palette knife. Bake in a preheated oven at 180C (160C fan, Gas four) for approximately 30 minutes. Then leave to cool in the tin for about five minutes. Mark your flapjack into 24 equal fingers. Make sure to allow plenty of time to cool completely before cutting your flapjack and removing the slices from the tin. Flapjacks are best served warm, but can also be stored in a cake tin for a treat later on.
