We are beginning to enter the business stage of the transfer window and all around the country the elite clubs are plotting their next moves in the market. We could well be set for the highest-spending summer ever as clubs make more and more signings with pre-season fast approaching. Following a quiet start to the window, Arsenal have suddenly sprung into life. The Gunners completed the signing of Brazilian youngster Marquinhos earlier this week, and they are now closing in on a £34million move for Porto midfielder Fabio Vieira, with the deal set to be made official imminently. Over at Liverpool, meanwhile, all the focus is currently on outgoings, with Reds icon Sadio Mane set to depart for Bayern Munich. The Senegalese forward will leave behind a huge legacy at Anfield, but appears determined to start a new challenge. Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham are also likely to further strengthen before the end of the summer, while the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa and West Ham may fancy their hopes of finishing in the European qualification spots with a few canny signings. With all that in mind there is plenty to keep your eye on. Express Sport keep you up-to-date with all the latest transfer news and gossip below...
