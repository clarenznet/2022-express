Jennifer Lopez, 52, has taken to Instagram to share pictures of herself enjoying a relaxing bubble bath. The photos came prior to Sunday night's MTV Movie and TV Awards. The singer could be seen showing off her bare shoulders as she wore large, golden hoop earrings. Relaxing in the tub, Jennifer wore her long brown locks in a bun as she also sported a golden locket chain. The star can be seen scrolling through her phone in the photos.  In the caption to the post she wrote: “Happiness is a long hot bubble bath (even if you have to take a quick call!) See you later @MTV!!!!” (sic) Fans and friends rushed to the comments to praise the star. Iamskyeholland wrote: “Cozy,” alongside a love heart face emoji. Egt239 penned: “Calling you”.  Jenne exclaimed: "You're everything to me." And Dzifa gushed: "Such a timeless beauty." Later that evening, Jennifer attended the MTV Awards donning a daring leather black display. During the ceremony, the On The Floor hitmaker took to the stage to accept the accolade for her song On My Way from her film Marry Me.
