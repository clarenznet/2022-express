Ashley Roberts, 40, stunned at Wimbledon today as she posed in her gold satin dress. She matched the tight-fitted cutout dress with an oversized blazer, and accessorised with a white tote bag and white heels. The former Pussycat Doll styled her blonde tresses in a high bun, with her bangs left at the front. However, once the Heart FM DJ took to her seat, Ashley put on a rather boozy display as she watched the match. While cheering on from her seat, seh could be seen drinking Pimms and champagne. She also posed with sunglasses on as she pulled faces with her beverages.
