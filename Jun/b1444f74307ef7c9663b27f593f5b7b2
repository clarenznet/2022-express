Jessica Chastain looked characteristically gorgeous as she posed for photos on Monday. The Zero Dark Thirty actress, 45, wore a chic and stylish black mesh shirt with embroidered sleeves and a very plunging neckline. The top had white ruffles which cascaded down Jessicaâ€™s incredible figure until they reached her smart black flared trousers. She wore her long auburn hair in loose waves swept to one side, with smokey eye makeup and a coral toned lip. Jessica was joined by Sex Education star Gillian Anderson, who also looked incredible in a floor length pink and brown striped down with a keyhole neckline and triangle cutouts across her midriff. The Hollywood stars were celebrating the launch of Paramount+ at Outernet London.
