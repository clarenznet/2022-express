The British number one was defeated by French player Caroline Garcia, who is ranked 55th in the world. When asked about the outcome of the match, Ms Raducanu said: "I didn't have many expectations of myself". She added that she didn't feel any pressure as she is only 19 years old and "literally won a slam" - referring to the US Open. But Ms Raducanu's blase "Gen Z" attitude toward failure has been slammed by Daily Mail columnist Mike Column, who criticised the tennis star for just being happy to have taken part in the tournament. He said: "If it's not about winning, why do they keep score and hand out medals for the fastest, highest and strongest?' "Or in Raducanu's case, why does she think they hand out millions of dollars and Tiffany jewellery? So she can smile and wave as she leaves the court after losing?" FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
