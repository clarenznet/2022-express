While a UK ban on Russian oil imports starts at the end of this year, Ecohustler online magazine, which has sent out thousands of stickers, claims the big stores cannot name any concrete actions they are taking to cut ties with Russian oil traders. A third of UK diesel imports are from Russia. Rhian Bartlett from Sainsbury’s said: “We have been working hard to reduce the amount of diesel we sell from Russia.” The British Retail Consortium said its members were “in the process” of phasing out Russian diesel.
