The Queen, 96, has just released her official Platinum Jubilee portrait. Her Majesty looks effortlessly regal sitting in Windsor Castle dressed all in blue. The backdrop of the picture shows the Round Tower. The portrait is symbolic, as Queen Elizabeth is the first ever British monarch to mark 70 years of reign. The photograph was taken by Mr Ranald Mackechnie, according to a Buckingham Palace statement. The Queen's knee-length blue dress coat looks beautiful on the monarch. The dress was adorned with white and gold lace down the centre of the dress and around her collar. For jewellery, the monarch kept things relatively simple.
