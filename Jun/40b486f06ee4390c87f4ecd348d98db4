With Wimbledon 2022 getting underway on Monday, players will be undergoing their final preparations before looking to make a name for themselves in the third Grand Slam of the season. And if glory on one of tennis' biggest stages isn't enough incentive, this year's prize money totals a record amount. The All England Lawn Tennis Club has announced that the Wimbledon 2022 prize pot stands at £40,350,000, with the potential winnings equal across the ATP and WTA draws. It's a 15 per cent increase from the £35,334,000 on offer in 2021 and 6.2 per cent above the previous record - £38,000,000 in 2019. Despite the hefty increase in prize money available this year, Wimbledon still won't be paying its competitors as much as the US Open (£6.9m less) and Australian Open (£3.7m less). However, there will be around £2.6m more on the table than in the French Open. As is customary, more winnings are up for grabs in the men's and women's singles draws than in the doubles. The 2022 singles champions will win a staggering £2,000,000, with the finalists receiving just over half - £1,050,000. In the doubles, £540,000 is up for grabs for the four champions, and exactly half - £270,000 - will go to the two unsuccessful teams.

The £2,000,000 on offer this year is a welcome increase on the £1,700,000 Novak Djokovic and Ash Barty pocketed in 2021. Djokovic is eyeing his seventh Wimbledon title this summer, and he's the overwhelming favourite to move one behind Roger Federer's record tally of eight. Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal is vying to win his third major of the season and move one step closer to completing an illustrious Calendar Slam. Women's world No 1 Iga Swiatek is currently the favourite to win her third career Grand Slam. There is plenty of intrigue across the WTA draw, with Serena Williams making her return to the iconic SW19 grass as a wildcard and Emma Raducanu entering as a member of the tour for the first time.
