She paired her dress, in Royal Ascot fashion, with Philip Treacy's Rose-Embellished Fascinator in Black and White. This featured some ribbon and a large white rose. The fascinator and dress perfectly complemented each other. The royal wore the Romy 100 Black Suede Pumps from Jimmy Choo on her feet. As for her hair, Beatrice went for a simple look. She wore her long tresses down on the opposite side of her head to where her fascinator sat. Her makeup was minimal, with the Princess opting for nude lipstick. She also went for a classic smokey eye.  Princess Beatrice wasn't the first royal to wear a black and white polka dot number at Royal Ascot this year. Both the York Princess and Kate Middleton channelled Audrey Hepburn at this week's events. Just yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in an Alexandra Rich dress. It was predominantly white with small black polka dots. The dress was ankle length and featured a high collar. It also had long sleeves. She was the epitome of grace and elegance in a wide-brimmed dark cartwheel hat. In keeping with the black and white theme, this boasted beautiful white flowers. Royal fans loved Beatrice's look today. Instagram user @daisyrootsdeb commented: "Beatrice is looking fabulous lately ... is someone advising her on her clothes I wonder? Such a lovely outfit."
