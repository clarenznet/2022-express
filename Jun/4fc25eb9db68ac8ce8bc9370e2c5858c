The organisation More in Common has released a new report that found a mere two percent of the UK population believe that a “debate” on transgender people is a top issue facing the country. More in Common was founded in 2016 in the aftermath of Jo Cox’s tragic murder by Tommy Mair, a domestic terrorist who shot and stabbed the MP multiple times. Its name is inspired by Cox’s maiden speech in which she said we “have far more in common than that which divides us. ”The findings of the report, which were published on June 16, stated: “Most are aware of the issues involved, a quarter know someone who is transgender, and for most the starting points are compassion and common sense. “More agree (46 percent) than disagree (32 percent) that a trans man is a man and a trans woman is a woman.” Debate on conversion therapy — a widely discredited practice that attempts to alter a person’s sexual orienation or gender from LGBTQ+ to heterosexual — has raged in Westminster in recent years. The practice includes a variety of methods, including religious prayer and even torture. In 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposed that the banning of all types of conversion therapy for anybody should be mentioned in the Queen’s speech. That year the Queen said: "Measures will be brought forward to address racial and ethnic disparities and ban conversion therapy." This was followed by comments from Liz Truss, then-Minister for Women and Equalities, today Foreign Secretary, who said: “We want to make sure that people in this country are protected, and these proposals mean nobody will be subjected to coercive and abhorrent conversion therapy.” However, a year later, in March 2022, leaked reports to ITV News suggested that the Government was u-turning on its previous rhetoric, and would not ban conversion therapies. But, in what appeared to be an eleventh-hour decision, Mr Johnson confirmed that No 10 would in fact ban conversion therapies — although these would only be confined to gay conversion “therapy”. The equivalent practice for transgender people will remain legal, according to ITV and Sky News. These new plans were later confirmed in the 2022 Queen's Speech.

This sparked an intense reaction from some individuals, including author JK Rowling. Taking to Twitter to oppose the reforms, she wrote: “The law Nicola Sturgeon’s trying to pass in Scotland will harm the most vulnerable women in society: those seeking help after male violence/rape and incarcerated women,” Elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government recently confirmed that NHS Wales had signed up to a Memorandum of Understanding that would ban conversion therapy in the country.

And, in 2021, Northern Ireland became the first UK nation to vote in favour of banning conversion therapy. Reacting to the news, Nancy Kelley, CEO of Stonewall, said: “This fantastic result is the culmination of years of campaigning and the recent work of the Ban Conversion Therapy Northern Ireland coalition, which we’re proud to be part of.”
