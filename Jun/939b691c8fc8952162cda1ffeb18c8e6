Poor Leo piled on the pounds while he was unable to see and sniff the world outside for half a decade, leaving him with claws grown to unnatural lengths. Now, rescue staff are hoping they can find him a happy forever home where he can feel the grass between his newly-trimmed paws.  The six-year-old beagle has been taken into the care of Oakwood Dog Rescue, in Hull, following his ordeal. Rescue staff said the sweet boy had "had a really tough time". Leo is now on a weight loss journey after being kept inside for so long. Staff said he was now enjoying going out on walks for the first time and "making new friends". "This poor boy has had a really tough time," staff told Hull Live. "Leo has spent the last five years inside a home never going on walks or seeing the outside world, he is extremely overweight and he had claws growing into his pads (these are now sorted)."   Pictures showed Leo's overgrown and curled claws, which can happen to all dog breeds when they aren't properly exercised and stay sedentary. The claws had curled over and had started growing into his paws, no doubt leaving him in terrible discomfort. Oakwood Rescue added: "Despite living an incredibly sheltered life he is the sweetest boy, he has taken coming to us in his stride and is enjoying meeting new people and venturing out on little walks – he’s even made a few dog friends!   "Leo has started his weight loss journey and hopefully he will steal someone's heart soon." If you think you could give Leo a loving forever home, find out more about how to apply through the rescue's site at oakwooddogrescue.co.uk. Today's appeal comes after a litter of Caucasian shepherd puppies, which the RSPCA warned would grow to be "incredibly large", found themselves in an appeal to find their special new homes last week.
