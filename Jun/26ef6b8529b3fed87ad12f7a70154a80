The Duchess, 74, looked elegant as she sat next to Prince William for the third day of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The open-air concert, broadcast by the BBC, attracted an estimated 22,000-strong crowd, with millions more expected to watch the spectacle from home. The show is headlined by Diana Ross, with appearances from Alicia Keys, UK Eurovision entry Sam Ryder, and Queen + Adam Lambert. The two-and-a-half-hour show will also feature Sir David Attenborough, David Beckham, and a recorded piece by Elton John. The Duchess of Cornwall took her seat next to Prince William, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte to his other side. Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, watched the show from the children's other side.  The Duchess of Cornwall also had Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The show was kicked off by a performance by Queen + Adam Lambert, and a segment by comedian Lee Mack. The Prince of Wales, 73, and Prince William, 39, will lead tributes to the monarch after she pulled out of her scheduled appearance at St Paulâ€™s Cathedral on Friday and Epsom Derby on Saturday. The Queen, 96, is believed to have watched the action from the comfort of Windsor Palace.  She was represented by her daughter, Princess Anne, at the event. It had been hoped the Queen would be in attendance at the concert near the Palace, but Her Majesty suffered "discomfort" during her appearance at the Trooping the Colour parade on Thursday. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall surprised royal fans gathered around the Palace following the parade with an impromptu walkabout to greet those who turned out for the celebrations in person. They also featured in a guest episode of iconic soap opera "EastEnders" as part of the Jubilee weekend.  MORE TO FOLLOW...
