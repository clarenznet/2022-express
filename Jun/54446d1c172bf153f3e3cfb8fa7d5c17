Dame Mary Berry, 87, looked fantastic today as she attended day four of Wimbledon 2022 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. The former Great British Bake Off judge appeared in great spirits as she smiled for the cameras. She donned a fabulous white midi dress that featured an elaborate floral pattern and she paired it with a large pearl necklace. Dame Mary added a touch of colour to her outfit by matching her fuchsia cardigan to some round-toed pumps in the same hue.
