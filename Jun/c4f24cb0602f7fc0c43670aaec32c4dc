Recently Clash magazine wrote that he "returns with his most well-rounded album to date, a deft fusion of genres. Change The Show is a deep dive into his musings on life, love and everything in-between and demonstrates a more thoughtful and self-reflective approach to life from Miles". The philosophical side of his art shines through tonight, with Coup De Grace being exemplary of his new found deep dive into the tough topics - perhaps a side less seen in his previous more rock n roll driven work to date. The thumping Aviation taken from The Last Shadow Puppets catalogue provides a more contemplative sound that shows a suave edge to his ample songwriting ability. A timely appearance mid set from main support for the night comes from Brooke Coombes and very special guest Corinne Bailey Rae. They are met with sheer delight from the crowd, Bailey Rae greeted with a warm nostalgia by a woozy audience.   The infectious Colour of the Trap Is a well honed track  that has the Roundhouse in raptures, as does The Last Shadow Puppets’ anthemic Standing Next To Me’ from their hugely successful debut album The Age of the Understatement. As Kane lurches into final track Come Closer, after waiting during a teasing lengthy break before the encore, the crowd have reached fever pitch, creating an exhilarating end.
