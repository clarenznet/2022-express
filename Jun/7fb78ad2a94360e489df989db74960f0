The Platinum Jubilee is over after four days of huge celebrations across the UK. An estimated 16,000 parties took place in honour of the Queen’s 70 year reign, and even though the weather was suitably British, that didn’t stop millions from gathering with family, friends and neighbours for the first of its kind Jubilee. Following the end of the celebrations on Sunday, the Queen issued an official statement thanking the nation. She said she was "humbled" by the public for their celebrations, and said her "heart has been with" everyone celebrating. The Queen's statement continued: “I thank you all most sincerely for your good wishes and for the part you have all played in these happy celebrations.” This year it is estimated that up to 18 million people took part in ‘Big Jubilee Lunch’ parties across the country over the past three days. So whether you’re taking your bunting down or making your way through Tuppaware’s of leftover sandwiches, here is a selection of images from the nation’s street parties this weekend.
