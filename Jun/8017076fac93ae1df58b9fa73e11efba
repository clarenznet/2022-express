Over 200,000 spectators are expected to flock to West Sussex to witness one of the most eagerly anticipated motoring events of the year. The festival will begin at 9am on Thursday, June 23 and run until Sunday, June 26. To mark Thursday’s big opening, the incredible Red Arrows soared in the skies around Britain on the way to West Sussex. The famous RAF team set off from RAF base Scampton at 9.50am today. They stopped off at Farnborough for a couple of hours before heading off again for the Goodwood Festival display at 12.30pm. On their way to Farnborough, the red arrows passed several towns.
