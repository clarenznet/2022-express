While Ronnie Wood today celebrates his 75th birthday today, his fellow band members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both 78, have posted footage of themselves enjoying a flamenco party in the Spanish city. Ahead of kicking off their tour, Mick and Keith were keen to keep up with local life. "Enjoying lots of what Madrid has to offer, from fallen angels to Flamenco!" Mick posted on his Instagram account. His 2.5 million followers were treated to a string of snaps from the city. Mick posed by a bar, a statue, and even next to the classic Picasso painting Guernica. Showing his sense of humour hasn't dulled over the years, he also took a cheeky snap beside a mannequin wearing a wedding dress. Keith Richards was also in attendance with his wife, Patti Hansen, and donned a signature leather jacket and hat to the Spanish party.
