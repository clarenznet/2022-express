Coleen Rooney, 36, took to Instagram earlier this week to share an insight into her family trip to Dubai. Wayne Rooneyâ€™s wife appeared to have put the Rebekah Vardy trial behind her as she jetted off to the sunny holiday destination. In the pictures, Coleen could be seen enjoying the sea with Wayne and their four sons as they explored the coast by boat. Other photos show the family of six swimming with dolphins, while others only show Coleen posing alongside some of her children.
