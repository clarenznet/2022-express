Liverpool have ended their interest in signing Barcelona wonderkid Gavi due to their belief the youngster will sign a new deal at the Nou Camp, reports claim. Gavi is said to be in talks with Barca chiefs over a new deal. Jurgen Klopp is expected to sign a new central midfielder this summer having failed to replace Georginio Wijnaldum a year ago. The Reds opted to focus elsewhere last year, but are expected to reinforce the middle of the park this summer. Gavi was seen as the ideal candidate, due to his immense talent, frightening potential and release clause in his contract. His current deal has a release clause of just €42million (£36m), meaning he is certainly affordable for the Reds. However, Gavi is expected to put pen to paper on a new contract with a significantly larger release clause. As a result, Liverpool have apparently ended their interest. Spanish outlet SPORT claims Liverpool had hope of being able to lure Gavi away from the Nou Camp, but his new contract will include a release clause of €1billion, the same as Pedri, Ansu Fati, Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres. Instead, Liverpool are believed to be interested in signing Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips. The Englishman would have been available for just £25m this summer if the Whites had been relegated, but is now expected to cost significantly more. Liverpool are expected to challenge Manchester City for the England international's signature, with Pep Guardiola eager to sign him as a replacement for Fernandinho. Klopp and new sporting director Julian Ward are expected to have a busy summer transfer window, with Sadio Mane set to depart for Bayern Munich. Liverpool are eager to sign a ready-made replacement before Mane leaves, with Phillips' team-mate Raphinha also being monitored.
