BT is running a big incentive to get new customers to sign up to one of its broadband packages. Right now the iconic telecoms firm is offering up to £120 in cashback when new customers sign up for a fibre broadband package. BT will throw in a pre-paid Mastercard loaded with £120 in funds when new customers sign up to get the Fibre 2 package, thanks to a deal being run in conjunction with Broadband Genie. This plan offers download speeds of between 57Mbps and 73Mbps which is more than enough bandwidth to stream movies or boxsets in HD, play online games and download HD movies on multiple devices at once. This plan costs £33.99 a month for 24 months and will also require a £9.99 upfront fee. You need to bear in mind though this price is for broadband only and doesn't include a landline.  Besides this money saving deal, BT and Broadband Genie have also combined to offer another deal on the Fibre 1 package which offers new customers cashback. With this deal you'll get a pre-paid Mastercard with £60 credit, plus access to broadband that offers speeds of between 49Mbps and 50Mbps. BT says this offers enough bandwidth to browse, stream and download on a few devices at once. Once again, this package is broadband only and doesn't include a landline.  If you like the sound of this deal and want to earn cashback you need to act quick as the deal runs out on June 9. Anyone that signs up to this deal and is sent a pre-paid Mastercard can use it at any place that accepts Mastercard online or over the phone. It works exactly like having an extra cash in your back pocket, so you can use this extra windfall to treat yourself or for something more practical.
