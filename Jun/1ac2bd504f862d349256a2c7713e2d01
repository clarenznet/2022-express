She said: “We are expecting to send the flight later today. “I can’t say exactly how many people will be on the flight. "The really important thing is that we establish the principle and we start to break the business model of these appalling people traffickers." Speaking to Sky News, she added: “There will be people on the flight and if they are not on this flight they will be on the next flight because we are determined to break the model of the appalling people traffickers and sort this issue out which has caused untold misery, including people dying in the English Channel.” The Foreign Secretary was unable to confirm how many people would be on the flight with some reports claiming the number could be as low as seven.
