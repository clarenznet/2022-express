As many prepare to sit down for a host of Platinum Jubilee meals, a poll reveals most people under 30 struggle with dinner party etiquette and 73 percent think it is dying out. But six out of 10 believe people aged over 60 could teach them a thing or two about how to behave properly at the table. Rules they find most confusing include knowing which cutlery to use with each course and whether you should tear your bread roll with your hands or cut it with a knife. Confusion also reigns over what to do with your knife, fork and napkin when you have finished eating, which glass is for what drink and where to put your phone. Some confessed they had no idea you should not put your elbows on the table or keep your mouth closed when eating. More than half of the 2,000 polled have been told they have behaved incorrectly at a formal meal. Six in 10 have googled dinner party etiquette, according to the survey for Specsavers Home Visits, as part of its #GenerationWOW campaign – which highlights the knowledge and skills of older people. It has created a tutorial with etiquette expert Diana Mather, who explains you should work your way from the outside in with cutlery and bread rolls should be broken by hand. She said: “Things like etiquette can seem intimidating but what better time than the Platinum Jubilee to learn a bit about it? “I hope my tips will help but there’s really no substitute for talking to an older friend or relative.”
