They want nominal £1 damages from the ex-Sinn Fein leader in a case which could see him cross-examined in the High Court over long-standing claims he was a senior IRA member. Mr Adams, 73, has always denied membership of the terror group or any involvement in its campaign, in Northern Ireland or on the mainland. Three men are suing Mr Adams over the 1996 truck attacks in Manchester and London Docklands and the Old Bailey car bomb of 1973. Jon Ganesh, a security guard hurt at Docklands, said:"We have to make a stand and get justice for the victims. "Not just my friends who died at Canary Wharf or the three of us but all victims of the IRA's despicable campaign. It's not about any money... it's about the principle." "Gerry Adams will have a chance to defend himself in court and answer the allegations." Newsagent Inam Bashir, 34, and his assistant John Jeffries, 31, were killed by a bomb at South Quay which injured 100 people, many seriously - £150million of damage was caused. The attack ended the IRA ceasefire agreed in 1994. One bomber given 25 years was freed after two. Four months later, Manchester city centre was hit. No one died but 212 were hurt as £700million of damage was done by the biggest UK bomb since World War Two. Barry Laycock, an injured rail worker, has joined Mr Ganesh in suing Mr Adams with ex-policeman John Clark who was hurt at the Old Bailey. Caretaker Frederick Milton, 60, died after a heart attack and 160 were wounded. Mr Adams has for years faced allegations of being a senior member of the IRA's army council. In 2012, he dismissed claims by IRA bomber Dolours Price that Mr Adams was her commanding officer and that he sanctioned the attack on the Old Bailey. Price, who was convicted with her sister Marian, alleged the London bombing campaign had been "approved" by Mr Adams - a claim he strenuously denies. In 2014 he was questioned by police about Jean McConville, a 37-year-old mother of 10 who was kidnapped from her home in Belfast in December 1972 but he was released without charge. Suspected of being a British Army informer, she was shot and buried in an unmarked location. Her remains were finally found on Shelling Hill Beach in County Louth, following a storm, in August 2003. During the 1970s, Mr Adams was twice questioned about his alleged membership of the IRA but he was never prosecuted. Mr Adams was Sinn Fein president from 1983 to 2018. He was MP for Belfast West from 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2011 but never took his seat at Westminster. He was a member for Louth of the Dail, Ireland's Parliament, from 2011 until 2020. The trio's case could go before a judge for a preliminary hearing in three months.
