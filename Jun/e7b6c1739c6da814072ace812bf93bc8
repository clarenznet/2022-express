Queen Elizabeth II has presided over some of the most tremendous social and cultural changes during her 70-year reign. But she hasn’t just witnessed the far-reaching evolutions of the United Kingdom, but has also presided over considerable development and change in Commonwealth countries across the world. Based on free and voluntary cooperation, the 54-member organisation represents about a quarter of the world’s population, with the vast majority being former British colonies. Some members are reconsidering their membership of the group, particularly after Barbados finalised its decision to remove the Queen as head of state in November 2021. The country even elected its first president during a ceremony witnessed by Prince Charles. There is also the question of what could happen to the Commonwealth when the Queen eventually dies, and whether this could spur on further decisions to break away from the union.

Relationships evolve. Friendship endures.” Belize is also said to be considering a bid for independence from the Commonwealth. Henry Charles Usher, minister for constitutional and political reform, told Belize’s parliament in March 2022: “The decolonisation process is enveloping the Caribbean region. “Perhaps it is time for Belize to take the next step in truly owning our independence. But it is a matter that the people of Belize must decide on.” DON'T MISSPrincess Beatrice dazzles in glittering floor-length gown [PHOTOS]'Kate would wear this!'
