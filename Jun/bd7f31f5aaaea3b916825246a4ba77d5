 She said: “I've got an operation on my throat coming up very very soon and I'm getting a lot of messages off people who are very worried because they're not sure whether it's sinister or not. “So I'd just like to say to my fans out there, I'm having it done. “As soon as I'm married I'll be getting it taken out and I'm sure everything is going to be fine.”   According to Cancer Research UK, roughly 90 percent survive their cancer for five or more years after their diagnosis. In the UK, roughly 2,000 new cases of this type of cancer occur and it tends to be more common over the age of 60. The symptoms of laryngeal cancer, according to the NHS, include: There are several types of surgeries available to treat laryngeal cancer that Fox could undergo. Some of the main surgeries used are endoscopic resection, in other words laser surgery through the mouth; partial removal of the voice box, known as a partial laryngectomy; and removal of the entire voice box, known as total laryngectomy. Cancer Research UK explains that laser surgery is often used to treat early laryngeal cancer or precancerous cells. Partial laryngectomies are also performed during the early stages of laryngeal cancer. Difficulty with swallowing and communicating is common after a partial laryngectomy. Explaining the effects of the surgery, the charity explains: “You keep at least part of one vocal cord. “You are usually still able to speak afterwards. But your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.” Total laryngectomies, on the other hand, are incredibly invasive and people undergoing the surgery will lose their voice and have to breathe out of a stoma – a hole in your neck.
