David Dimbleby, 83, decided to get his first tattoo when he was 75. It was a "modest sized" scorpion on his right shoulder. Why did he choose a scorpion? The presenter said the tattoo symbolises his Scorpio star sign. Those born under the zodiac sign, like David Dimbleby, are ambitious, intelligent, and confident. Scorpios put all their effort into achieving whatever they want to accomplish and are known to be the hardest workers in the zodiac. David Dimbleby decided to get his body permanently marked after exploring tattoo artistry in one of his shows.

During one episode, the presenter was offered a tattoo but he admitted he wasn't too sure about it. Dimbleby explained: “When I saw it in a preview of the film I thought, ‘That’s a bit feeble.’ "I thought it was wimpish having it just drawn on and I needed to man up.  "I thought of Winston Churchill having his done while mine was being done. "It wasn’t painful at all, it just zings a bit,” he told the Radio Times. The presenter continued: “I’m rather fond of it actually, this little scorpion sitting on my shoulder ready to attack my enemies. "It’s beautifully done, actually. "It’s a work of art. "They have these 3D tattoos now that are done using photographs, which are just astonishing, but I wasn’t about to have one myself. “I thought the shoulder was the most discreet place. "I didn’t want it on my arm because it would show every time I rolled up my sleeve.” After getting the tattoo, David Dimbleby said “you are only old once" and admitted that he had “always wanted a tattoo". "I thought I might as well have it done now. "It’s a dream come true for me,” he said.
