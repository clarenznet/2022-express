Anita Dobson, 73, is well-known for her role as Angie Watts in EastEnders and was on hand to present a prestigious award to on-screen daughter Letitia, who plays Sharon Watts. But the actress distracted fans with her incredible appearance as she opted for a short mini dress to present the award. Anita looked incredible in a glittery purple minidress which featured a low-cut neckline. Gold sequins were placed around her neck and the star added a gold necklace to match. Her silver locks were swept back into a chic p’do while she added a slick of red lipstick. ITV viewers tuning into the awards at home were gobsmacked by Anita’s appearance and rushed to Twitter to comment.
