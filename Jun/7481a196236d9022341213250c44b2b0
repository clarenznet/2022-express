Business-owner Colin and dog-trainer Janet were on the hunt for the perfect holiday home on the Eastern Algarve in Portugal. For their budget of £350,000, Danni Menzies found five options to show them, but despite calling one their "dream home," the couple decided not to purchase any. A Place in the Sun fans quickly took to social media to blast the couple for "wasting time" on the Channel 4 staple. Property three, a four-bed villa in Moncarapacho, was the only potential for the couple by the end of the search. The recently refurbished former farmhouse was located on the outskirts of town within walking distance from the centre. Close to a picturesque beach, it came with a good amount of living space and a massive plot of over 10,500 square metres. Valued at £431,192, the couple seemed keen to consider the purchase despite it being over budget. READ MORE: Blue Bloods exit: Why did Amy Carlson leave NBC drama as Linda Reagan? When the time came to sit and reveal to Danni what they had decided, the property expert seemed surprise at their change of heart. "It was one of the nicest properties we've ever seen," Colin commented. "We really liked it as you know." However, after doing some further research the two had decided against making an offer despite previously referring to it as their "dream". Janet explained: "We talked to local friends who have had work done and suddenly you find out you're talking £430,000, £440,000." "We're still thinking about it," Colin added. "We hope that over the next few weeks we can see a way of getting that over the line." "Okay, so we're not putting in an offer today?" Danni asked, looking confused. "I don't think we'll put in an offer, it wouldn't be fair to put an offer in," Colin clarified. Danni said she'd inform the agent of the couple's interest but advised them to act fast as the homes they were after were the most desirable. DON'T MISS...
