Scaffolding also gave way at the property in Selly Oak, Birmingham, where emergency services remain to assess residents. Miraculously, no one has been seriously hurt in the horror. But the road, home to many student digs, has been closed as firefighters make the area safe again. A 21-year-old student, who asked not to be named, said: "I saw the fire service and could see something had fallen down. I think it's a loft extension. Some of the other houses have it." Residents from surrounding buildings were asked to leave as a "precaution," Birmingham Live reports. The collapse happened at around 11am at the property just minutes from University of Birmingham. A spokesperson for West Midlands Fire Service wrote: "Firefighters from Bournbrook fire station have responded to Heeley Road, Selly Oak where a mid-terraced house has partially collapsed along with some scaffolding. "Around eight people have been evacuated from neighbouring properties as a precaution. The road is currently closed." But paramedics were not called to the scene, West Midlands Ambulance Service said. Photographs show residents stood on the pavement outside the properties, which are adjacent to a railway line which runs north into central Birmingham. Meanwhile, the large city is mourning the death of a grandmother, who was killed in an explosion in the Kingstanding neighbourhood on Sunday night. Doreen Rees-Bibb, 79, was reportedly trapped in the three-bedroom terraced house. Other homes were evacuated, leaving 20 people unable to access their homes. Emotional tributes have since been paid to Doreen.
