Officers and a large number of volunteers were out throughout last night looking for the child, thought to be aged three to five. So many people turned out to help with the search that police eventually asked members of the public to "please return home" at around 2am, as they were concerned the numbers involved might scare the child into no returning home. But the youngster was found by around 10am this morning - nearly 12 hours after going missing. Police and firefighters had initially knocked on doors and searched a river in Old Colwyn, north Wales, without success.The child was last seen at around 10.30pm in the village, North Wales Live reports. Dog units and a helicopter were used in the search. North Wales Police said earlier this morning: "T/Supt Jon Bowcott who is overseeing the search and investigation into the young child seen alone in Colwyn Bay yesterday evening would like to thank the public for their assistance, however we would now like members of the public to return home. "Officers will continue to search for and attempt to identify the child through the night, along with professional search teams. "There is currently a significant number of members of the public out searching for the child, and whilst initially helpful, this may now be causing the child, if still out to stay hidden. "CCTV shows the child, who, whilst young to be out at 10pm is clothed, and does not appear to be in any imminent danger or to be concerned or upset. "I want to repeat that we will continue to search for the child and conduct an investigation to identify them."  Old Colwyn, just east of Colwyn Bay, is a large village on the coast in north Wales. It is just north of Snowdonia National Park. Hundreds of people had originally left messages of support on the North Wales Live Facebook page.Patricia Smith said: "Oh no that’s terrible. I hope that they find him. He could be anywhere! He looks very young and he can’t have got far. Hope they find him soon."
