Police raided the singer's home in 2014 as part of an investigation into a sex assault claim. However, he was never arrested. Speaking at a meeting in the House of Lords yesterday, Sir Cliff, 81, was among several people wrongly accused who pleaded with MPs and peers to grant anonymity for sex offences suspects before they are charged. We said the experience could "completely destroy you", adding that at points he would wake in the night with a racing pulse, fearing a heart attack. Currently, alleged victims of sexual offences receive lifelong anonymity but there is no law against naming a suspect. Campaign group Falsely Accused Individuals for Reform has called for pre-charge naming of sexual offence suspects to be made a criminal offence in England and wales.
