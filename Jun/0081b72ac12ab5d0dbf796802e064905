Bradley Cooper, 47, has undergone huge transformations to play Leonard Bernstein, the Broadway artist behind West Side Story, in his latest biopic. The Hollywood actor has been spotted kissing his co-star Matt Bomer on a sidewalk in Manhattan, New York, while filming. Matt is taking on the role of a clarinet player whom Leonard did have a brief romance with. Bradley looked very different from his usual look, with prosthetics changing his nose, and his dark hair being slicked back with gel. He donned a beige trench coat over a white shirt with a dark green bowtie and black shoes. Bradley also wore a gold wedding band and was seen holding a cigarette. Last week, fans were left speechless when Netflix released the first look of the film including behind-the-scenes photos. In the clip, Bradley had completely transformed for the role with the use of prosthetics as he looked the spitting image of the composer. The actor was unrecognisable with his famous looks covered by a white-haired wrinkled man. In addition, The A Star Is Born actor is also directing the project which will also feature Carey Mulligan and Maya Hawke. The film will tell the story of the Broadway legend and his relationship with Felicia, who stayed with Bernstein all his life despite knowing he was gay. Filming had begun this month in New York with Cooper, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Fred Berner and Amy Durning all producing the movie. Leonard Bernstein was a musical savant and worked as a composer, pianist and conductor and was honored throughout his career with seven Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards and 16 Grammy Awards. He died in 1990 of a heart attack just five days after retiring from conducting. Spielberg was initially set to direct the film and had brought Bradley on board to star but then handed the role over to the actor. This will be Bradley's second feature in the director's chair following the most recent remake of A Star is Born.
