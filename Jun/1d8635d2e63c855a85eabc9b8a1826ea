A dog walker spotted the monster fish while strolling on Oxwich Bay in the Gower region of South Wales on Friday, June 10. They said they noticed a large object in the distance while with their dog Sasha and when they got to it, they described it as "the biggest fish we've ever seen".  The large aquatic creature has since been identified as an Atlantic bluefin tuna, an endangered species of the marine animal and the largest of its kind according to WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature). Wales Online reports thatÂ Atlantic bluefin tuna are endangered - due to overfishing dating back decades. However, there has been a resurgence in sightings across the UK. They are one of four species of tuna that visit the UK but usually in rare circumstances, predominantly visiting the southwestern coast of the UK in Cornwall. Ecologist Thomas Faulkner, who works closely with the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales, identified the species of tuna found on Oxwich Bay. He said: "Bluefin tuna are recolonising south western coastland, especially Cornwall. "These species are typically rare visitors to the UK and even rarer to Wales. They can reach up to four metres long, so you can identify this one just from the sheer size of it. The south or westerly winds could have washed it up from Cornwall or the Celtic deep." He added that it was a positive sign of the species growing in our waters.
