The Pretty Little Thing model, 27, did a candid question and answer session with her 19.8million followers after returning to her home country. Wearing nothing but a fluffy white rob, a fresh-faced Demi implored her fans to ask away. With the robe open, the star gave a glimpse of her large assests as she posed for the late-night snaps. One follower was desperate to know whether the bikini model had a boyfriend, to which Demi replied that she was single. Another fan asked what "enlightened" the star, as Demi revealed that she's inspired by "reading and music", while her robe fell seductively open.
