The Royal couple have been busy preparing for the birthday celebrations apart from visiting the Royal Ascot event this week. On the big day, doting father Mike shared an insight into the celebrations as they stood in a wide-open area surrounded by dozens of colourful balloons.  Although their full plans for Lena's birthday aren't known, the event will probably be held at their home on the Gatcombe Park Estate, where they live close to Zara's brother Peter, his daughters and mother Princess Anne and her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence. As well as young Lena, Zara and Mike are parents to Mia, eight, and one-year-old son Lucas. In a social media post Mike shared, he also gave an insight into some potential Ascot fashion he might style next year as he posed in Zara's striking hat. He joked in the caption: "How could I have forgot this one from yesterday!! We have already started planning for next year @ascotracecourse??"  Fans enjoyed the photos shared, and many wanted to wish the young royal a happy birthday, as one posted: "Happy birthday to Lena!" The couple will have more to celebrate next month, as they mark 11 years since tying the knot in Edinburgh. On the day, Zara wore a precious Greek tiara that belongs to her mother, Princess Anne.
