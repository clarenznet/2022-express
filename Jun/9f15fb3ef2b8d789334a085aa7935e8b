Heidi Klum, 49, looked fantastic last night as she stepped out in a risqué cut-out dress that put her toned muscles on display. The supermodel was photographed in Los Angeles, California, wearing the mini-dress that exposed her bare thighs and upper hips. She narrowly avoided a wardrobe malfunction as she opted to go without underwear to avoid it ruining the dress’ cut-out design. The show-stopping silver dress featured long sleeves and exposed her back, with Heidi pairing the outfit with some matching heeled sandals.
