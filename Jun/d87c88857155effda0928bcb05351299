The summer transfer window is finally open and things are well and truly heating up in the Premier League and beyond. The likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham can now officially sign new players in advance of the new campaign and will be looking to push through plenty of exciting deals over the coming weeks and months. The biggest story of the week involves the future of Darwin Nunez, who is believed to be in talks with Liverpool and United over a potential move to the Premier League ahead of next season. The Benfica forward is one of Europe's hottest prospects and looks set to take on a new challenge in England but it remains to be seen whether he will opt for a move to Anfield or if he will decide to join Erik ten Hag's revolution at Old Trafford this summer. United are also said to be in the market for a new central midfielder and have been heavily linked with the services of Frenkie de Jong, who excelled under Ten Hag's guidance at Ajax before joining Barcelona back in 2019. There is also plenty to discuss from elsewhere in the Premier League, with Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Everton all said to be chasing deals of their own as they look to improve their ranks before the first ball is kicked when the action gets back underway.
