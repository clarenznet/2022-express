Marilyn Monroe has stunned in a series of throwback snaps on what would have been the star's 96th birthday. The Hollywood legend is celebrated as a 1950s and early 1960s American singer and actress who won multiple awards for her film roles, including in the 1959 film, Some Like It Hot. Marilyn tragically died in 1962 after an overdose of barbiturates at the age of 36.  Before she rose to fame as sex icon and actress Marilyn Monroe, the star posed poolside as Norma Jean in a white, high-waisted bikini which would quickly become the star's signature style. Posing for a portrait in 1953, the film icon knelt on an orange sofa while donning a white bikini. The retro piece featured a number of black buttons and perfectly hugged her legendary curves. Another snap showed the star performing for US troops in a dazzling navy number which finished just below her knees. Marilyn had a huge grin on her face as she appeared on the stage while troops could be seen applauding the star. In one picture, the star grinned while on the set of 1953 film, Niagara while wearing a pretty pink halter neck dress. Another snap shows the star in a pair of dark denim jeans and a classic hite shirt while taking a stroll on the beach. Marilyn also posed in a metallic gold number which featured a plunging neckline for the classic 1953 film, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
