Lorraine Kelly caused a social media stir as the ITV host gave her eagle-eyed followers an insight into how she maintains her ageless visage. The Scottish-born presenter, who fronts her self-titled show on ITV, underwent a procedure that left her face "tingling". Taking to Instagram today, the 62-year-old shared the results of her facial. Lorraine underwent microneedling - a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that's used to treat skin concerns via collagen production. It involves pricking the skin with tiny sterilised needles. The small wounds cause your body to produce more collagen and elastin, which heal your skin and help you look younger, according to Healthline.com.
