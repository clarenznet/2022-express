 Dowden simply stuck the knife into Boris (who he's plainly sick of) and signed off with a big "huzzah for the Conservatives". What else was he going to do? Much talk too about what an honourable man he is? Really? Because he doesn't like the boss and he doesn't like losing? I'm not for a moment questioning Mr Dowden's honour or otherwise of course, which I am sure is impeccable, just musung that a very very honourable man might have left the gig before this set of dreadful results. But maybe that's just me. One caveat before the crazy talk of a Lib-Lab ruling coalition starts up again; let's just remind ourselves why we are in Tiverton and Wakefield at all - because Tiverton MP Neil Parish watched porn in the House of Commons and previous Wakefield Tory MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, was jailed for child sex offences.Those sexual freakshows alone might have been enough to put you off voting Tory, Boris or no Boris.The Prime Minister is unhelpfully out of the country - triggering not inaccurate analogies with the downfall of Mrs Thatcher, who was also out of the country as the plotters circled the wagons on her reign at No10.Speaking to broadcasters in Kigali Mr Johnson said: "Voters are going through a tough time at the moment."Indeed they are Boris, but not half as tough a time as you're about to go through.
