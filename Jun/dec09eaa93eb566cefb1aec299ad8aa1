Kate Moss, 48, made sure to leave an impression as she attended the Platinum Jubilee pageant. The former supermodel made sure to pay tribute to the Queen as she sported a union jack fitted blazer. Continuing the Royal theme, Kate clipped back a section of her signature blonde wavy tresses with white, blue and red flowers. Kate wore a long black maxi satin gown as she posed alongside Charlotte and Bridgerton's Phoebe Dynevor. As she posed for pictures the model held up her trail exposing her bright red stiletto heels. For accessories Kate layered silver necklaces, with one including a large rhinestone. Meanwhile, Phoebe kept it simple in a black and white spotted summer dress and Charlotte went for a bohemian look. Kate was just very publicly involved in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case. Appearing via videolink, the model told the court about the time her ex-beau came to her aid after she slipped down the stairs in Jamaica while they were on holiday. Questioned by Depp's attorney Benjamin Chew, Moss said: "No, he never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs. "He carried me to my room and got me medical attention." When questioned about the accident in Jamaica, Kate explained she slipped down the stairs and hurt her back following a rainstorm.
