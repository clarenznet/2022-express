With an estimated £74million left in unclaimed Premium Bond prizes, Britons are urged to check to see if they have ever won any money. As inflation soars and the cost of living crisis continues, any extra cash could be vital for families feeling the squeeze. Each month, National Savings & Investment (NS&I) announce two winners who will take home the £1million prize. When people buy premium bonds, they are entered into a monthly prize draw where they can win between £25 and £1million tax-free. Holders can check the app to see if they’ve won a prize in the June draw or any month during the last 65 years. In May NS&I announced that the premium bond “prize fund rate” – the proportion of the total amount invested paid out in prizes – is being increased from one percent to 1.4 percent in June.

Jill Waters, NS&I Retail Director, said there are many reasons to celebrate Premium Bonds this month. She said: "Firstly, we were pleased to announce the increase of Premium Bonds prize fund rate from one percent to 1.40 percent, effective from this month’s draw, which will see an extra 1.4 million prizes paid out. “The 65th anniversary of ERNIE's first draw is also a momentous occasion." Ms Waters continued: “The thrill of saving with Premium Bonds is still as present today as it was in 1957 and I am sure that is something our two jackpot winners from Essex and Kirklees would agree with. “Premium Bonds have really changed over the years, with the first draw having 23,142 prizes and this month’s draw seeing a total of 4,823,067 prizes – a record number for a Premium Bonds prize draw.”Premium Bonds must be held for a full calendar month before they can be entered into the monthly prize draw.
