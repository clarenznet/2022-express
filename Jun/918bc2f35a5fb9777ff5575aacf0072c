Megan Fox was a vision in pink last night as she stepped out with her beau Machine Gun Kelly. The Transformers star, 36, unveiled freshly blonde tresses with pink highlights, which perfectly matched her peachy-pink bodycon dress. Megan's fiance, 32, wore a pair of white flared cargo pants which he paired with a silver chain and pink and blue patterned top. Matching his model girlfriend, MGK showcased a head of vibrant, hot-pink hair. The couple's appearance comes as they arrived at The New York Hotel after having dinner ahead of Kelly's Hulu documentary premiere in New York.
