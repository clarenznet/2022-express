The Australian star, 46, opened up about how Borat actor Sacha has been her career champion and the perfect partner for 20 years. She admits he still gives her "butterflies in the stomach" and balancing hectic work and family commitments never gets in the way of regular date nights.  The couple, who have two daughters, Olive, 14, and Elula, 11, and a son, Montgomery, seven, said they met at a pretentious bash in 2001 and bonded over "taking the mick out of the other people in the party". Isla, honoured at the 2022 G'DAY AAA Arts Gala in LA on June 11, praised Sacha, 50, for his support, which has seen her star in hits such as Wedding Crashers, The Bachelorette and Definitely Maybe. "My husband advised me to do comedy. He was always saying, 'Isla, you are the funniest person at any dinner party.You need to do comedy'. I didn't see myself in that universe but through his support I realised I could write jokes and be a woman in comedy. "Female stories are being heard in comedy more than ever and it's exciting to be at the front of that."  Isla wed Sacha in Paris in 2010. Asked about the key to a successful marriage in Hollywood, she said: "Like all parents of small children I am doing my best to keep my kids anonymous and have as normal a life as possible. Like all wives and husbands who travel for work we do date nights. "I'm really lucky as he is the funniest person and we have a great friendship." The former Home And Away star also talked about the "cultural legacy" of the end of TV soap Neighbours, saying it was a "breeding ground for talented artists from Australia" who have had international careers. "It is a shame to see work disappearing for local talent but hopefully they come to LA," she added.
