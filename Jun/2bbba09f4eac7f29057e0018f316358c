Record levels were recorded in all parts of Britain in April, the ONS said, though experts have noted a softening of the market since. Prices rose over the year to £299,000 (an 11.9 percent annual jump) in England; to £212,000 (16.2 percent) in Wales; to £188,000 (16.2 percent) in Scotland; and to £165,000 (10.4 percent) in Northern Ireland.
