Andy Murray has been drawn to face James Duckworth in the first round at Wimbledon as the former British No 1 aims to better his performance from last year. Express Sport breaks down what Murray's projected route to the final would be. Projected route to the title by seeding: First round - James Duckworth Second round - John Isner Third round - Jannick Sinner Fourth round - Carlos Alcaraz Quarter-final - Novak Djokovic JUST IN:Â Tim Henman knows why Emma Raducanu is 'frustrated' ahead of Wimbledon  Semi-final - Hubert Hurkacz Final - Rafael Nadal Murray heads into Wimbledon off the back of a strong showing at the Stuttgart Open where he defeated Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach the final. The three-time major champion took Matteo Berrettini to three sets, but ultimately lost out to the Italian in the end.  DON'T MISS  But Murray picked up an injury during the match which forced him to withdraw from Queen's last week. The world No 51 admitted earlier this week that it was still touch and go on how his recovery would be ahead of the first round. "The next couple of days are pretty important for me," he said. "Obviously the plan is still to play. The injury that I had is improving. "I'm feeling better than I was on the Sunday afternoon, evening. Training has been going well in some aspects. With the nature of the injury, it's not stopped me from practising. I've been able to do a lot of work on the court, but there's specific shots that I haven't been able to practice yet." The 35-year-old reached the third round last year on his first return to Wimbledon in the men's singles draw since 2017. He came through tough tests against Nikoloz Basilashvili and Oscar Otte before losing to Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.
