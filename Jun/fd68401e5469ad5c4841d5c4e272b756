The former boxer entered a not guilty plea when he appeared before Westminster magistrates on Friday and was bailed to reappear at the same court on September 9.  "David Haye - 41 (13.10.80) appeared in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday, June 3," a statement from the Metropolitan Police said.
