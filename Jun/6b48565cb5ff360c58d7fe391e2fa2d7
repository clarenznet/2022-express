Rebel Wilson, 42, has been soaking up the sun on a romantic holiday in Corsica alongside girlfriend Ramona Agruma. The actress, who publicly announced her relationship with Ramona in an Instagram post on June 10, looked radiant as she posed in a retro-style bikini as they enjoyed the stunning sights on a yacht.  The Senior Year star showed off her impressive weight loss as she matched her pastel two-piece swimsuit with a cropped jacket and white-framed retro sunglasses. Meanwhile, Ramona also flaunted her toned bikini body while wearing a skimpy string swimsuit. After posting numerous snaps of their time together in Corsica, France, Rebel then uploaded a sweet selfie of the pair together in matching yellow tracksuits from Ramona’s clothing brand line, Lemon Ve Limon. Rebel posted several envy-inducing photos of the new couple's luxurious European holiday over the weekend. In one photo Rebel shared, she was perched on the edge of the cliff as she turned to flash a smile at the camera.
