Up to 18 caravans have been seen on Cowick Barton playing fields in Exeter, with reports they arrived on the site on the afternoon of Sunday, June 12. Pictures from the scene show the caravans parked along the edge of the fields as locals have reported washing lines tied to lamp posts - which are reportedly blocking paths and cycle lanes.  One eyewitness told DevonLive: "Travellers have managed to get into Cowick Barton playing fields which is very rare. I counted around 18 caravans at least - apparently, they were at Exwick playing fields yesterday." It is the second time in a week travellers have been seen in the area after just four days ago a group of travellers was quickly moved on, after descending upon the car park of B&Q in Exeter. Police were called to Avocet Road at Sowton Industrial Estate on June 8, when caravans and vehicles started appearing outside the DIY store at around 5.30pm. Police have confirmed there were no issues to deal with as the travellers had 'already moved on'. B&Q has also stated the incident was quickly resolved. A B&Q spokesperson said: “We can confirm that the unauthorised access to the store site was temporary, and has been resolved." It has not been confirmed for how long the travellers were on site.  Yesterday, June 13, Exeter City Council said it is aware of the group of travellers at Cowick Barton playing fields and confirmed it was in the process of dealing with the situation. A spokesperson for ECC said: "Our legal officers are aware of the travellers and have started the process we have to follow to deal with the situation."
