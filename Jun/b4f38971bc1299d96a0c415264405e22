It also had a black belt around its middle, cinching Beatrice’s waist. To match the belt, the Princess donned a black hairband, which gave her look a youthful twist.

Her make-up was simple and chic as she wore black eyeliner, blusher, and a slick of pink lipgloss. As for accessories, the Princess carried a small white clutch bag which matched her dress. She also donned dangling diamond earrings and a dainty silver bracelet.  The Princess's husband, Edoardo, looked dapper in a black velvet tuxedo and a bow tie. He wore a white shirt, a pair of smart black trousers, and shiny black brogues. Ever since appearing at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2011 wedding wearing a Philip Treacy hat, Beatrice has showed the public that she is a fan of a good headpiece. She owns multiple headbands and even donned a huge, eye-catching one to this year’s Trooping the Colour earlier this month. The headpiece was silver and featured hundreds of tiny pearls, lined with bigger pearls. At the time, royal fans complimented the look, with user @sym836k saying: “Loving that headband. Very chic.” Another royal fan, @isabelandreag commented: “Beatrice is the Queen of headbands.” User @sara_alef99 added: “She looks like a young Queen Victoria with that headband.”  Royal fans praised Beatrice’s look this evening too.
