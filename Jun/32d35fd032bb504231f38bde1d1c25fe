  Ricky Gervais has been displaying his signature dark humour by asking fans to vote for him to “win another award before I die”. The After Life creator is hoping to win big at the TV Choice Awards this year.      Ricky, 60, took to Twitter yesterday to ask a small favour of his 14.9 million followers. “You can vote for me to win another award before I die, if you like,” he penned. The star also knowingly added an angel emoji with the hashtag #AfterLife. He retweeted a post from TV Choice's official account, which told fans: “Don’t forget to vote in the 2022#tvchoiceawards.

Ricky is nominated in the category for his Netflix show After Life, which concluded its final season this year. Ricky plays protagonist Tony, who is learning to navigate the world after the death of his wife.     Ricky has candidly opened up about his health issues before, repeatedly mentioning the back problems that have seen him suffering for three decades. Last year, he admitted he was worried he would end up wheelchair-bound because of his health issues. While out on a run, the star experienced excruciating pain after trying to tie his shoelaces. It was so severe that his partner Jane Fallon even had to help him get dressed. READ MORE...

He said: “This is why I know I'll end up in a f***ing bucket one day. "I've got tennis tomorrow, that's got to be cancelled. Thank god I haven't got a gig. "Next tour, after this one, I'm changing the genre. It's not stand-up, it's sit-down."      Speaking about how he was left bedridden following a game of tennis in Italy, Ricky added that Jane was forced to act as caregiver again when he was unable to even make it to the bathroom. He said: “It's probably happened ten times significantly in 30 years, usually when I'm putting a toothbrush back or doing up a f***ing shoelace. "It's horrible. You forget how much you rely on your spine,” he added in an interview with The Sun. All three seasons of After Life are available to watch now on Netflix.
