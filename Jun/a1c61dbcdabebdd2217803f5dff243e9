The elite of the golf world will be reunited at the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, this week as the 2022 U.S. Open gets underway on Thursday. This tournament in particular will always hold special significance for Rory McIlroy, who ended his search for a major when he won the U.S. Open in 2011. Fresh from winning his 21st PGA Tour title at the Canadian Open on Sunday, the Northern Irishman will be back on the billing in Brookline. That journey from Toronto is a relatively short one, especially compared to those flying from Hertfordshire following the inaugural LIV Golf Invitational Series event. Charl Schwartzel beat the likes of Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson to collect $4.75million (£3.86m) for winning both individual and team contests at the Centurion Club near London, the biggest prize in the sport's history. Even last-place finisher Andy Ogletree was awarded $120,000 (£99,000) for his troubles despite being 24 over par by the time all 54 holes had been played. One can see why some players have had their heads turned considering that same $25m (£20m) prize purse will be offered at each of the LIV Golf Series' first seven tournaments. That sum is then doubled to $50m (£40m) for the eighth and final event, with the number of annual stops set to increase to 14 per year by 2024.

That means McIlroy & Co. would have to win two majors before they can match the numbers up for grabs in the new Saudi-funded competition. McIlroy has been vocal in his opposition against the LIV Golf Series and recently remarked it's obvious why some players have opted to leave the PGA for the lucrative new league. "It's boatloads of cash and it's money up front," the 33-year-old said earlier in June. "I get it and for some guys that's really enticing."

The USGA will allow those players recently suspended by the PGA to compete at the Country Club this weekend, but it may be one of the last opportunities to see a united golf field in action. "If the Saudis are hellbent on spending money in golf, let's try to get it spent in a way that benefits the wider ecosystem," added McIlroy. "That's where I would like to see it going, but whether that happens or not remains to be seen." 2022 U.S. Open prize money breakdown (based on 2021 figures) 1st: $2.25m (£1.9m) 2nd: $1.36m (£1.1m) 3rd: $862,500 (£713,000) 4th: $612,500 (£506,000) 5th: $512,500 (£424,000) 6th: $453,125 (£375,000) 7th: $421,875 (£350,000) 8th: $390,625 (£323,000) 9th: $365,625 (£303,000) 10th: $340,625 (£282,000)
