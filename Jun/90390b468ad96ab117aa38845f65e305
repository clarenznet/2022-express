All lanes of the M25 closed as emergency services rushed at the scene to assist those involved in the accident. It is still unknown if anyone was injured in the accident. Photos from motorway cameras show vehicles queuing for miles. Google Maps estimate the delay to 20 minutes against expected traffic. Earlier today, long delays were reported on the carriageway as one of the four lanes closed clockwise between J21A and J22. The closure was due to a vehicle that broke down. Congestion was also reported on the between junctions J3 and J2 in the late afternoon, with traffic now appearing back to normal. Another collision occured earlier today on the M25 anticlockwise between junctions J10 and J9. The incident is now cleared, although traffic remains. On the same direction, between junctions J10 and J9, motorists are in a gridlock due to the multiple obstructions of traffic.
