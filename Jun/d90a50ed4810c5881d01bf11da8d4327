Manchester City star Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Roma this summer transfer window, after the German midfielder was spotted in the Italian capital. Gundogan, 31, joined City for £22million in 2016 after four stellar seasons at Borussia Dortmund. The star had injury worries placed upon him when he moved, but has more than proved himself by remaining an integral part of City's engine room for more than half a decade. Reports suggested he may leave at the end of the season by seeking a new challenge away from the club, sparking rumours of a move abroad to a team in European competition. But after links had died down following his commitment to staying at City for the final season of his contract, Leggo have claimed that the star could move to Roma to join up with Jose Mourinho. The publication states that the star was recently seen in the Italian capital throughout pre-season. He reportedly earns around £110,000-per-week and is looking to move on in the not too distant future. Barcelona are reportedly favourites to land him, although financial woes may mean that the Blaugrana have to take a back seat. And that could hoist Roma into the driving seat, with the club determined to back Mourinho ahead of the new season. Gundogan claimed that he was extremely excited to be a part of City's squad, despite rumours tipping him for a move away. "I'm very settled," Gundogan admitted after his brace won City the league against Aston Villa. "I've been here for six years and I think the appreciation from the club is also big because I wouldn't be here for six years if they didn't appreciate me. I'm very grateful to play in such a great team. "So, I have one more year (at Man City), I'm looking forward to that year. I feel like there's a lot to achieve next year, a lot of things that are waiting for us and I'm just enjoying my time here." Roma will take part in the Europa League next season after finishing sixth in Serie A last season.
