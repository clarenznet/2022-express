Newquay is said to be Cornwall’s most-visited town, popular with tourists from across the country. Many visitors to Newquay, tourists and locals alike, drive in and face the task of finding a place to park in the town. Some of the town's car parks, particularly beach ones, have developed something of a reputation over the years with CornwallLive reporting stories of people being caught out by parking fines and expensive tickets. In fact, at one privately owned car park, eight hours costs £35 - the most expensive seaside parking in the country, Cornwall Live reports. Meanwhile some people, seeking to skip the ordeal of finding a space, opt for parking on the beach itself. This tends not to go too well, as one unfortunate motorist found out a few weeks ago when they parked up on Porth Beach, only to get their front wheel stuck in the sand. In response to the news that parking in Newquay can cost as much as some people spend on food in a week, breakdown provider Start Rescue has encouraged people to “shop around” to find somewhere cheaper.   Lee Puffet, managing director of Start Rescue, told Cornwall Live: “Parking our vehicle is something many of us take for granted and it’s the last thing we should be worrying about when taking a break at the seaside. "We often find a parking space at the seaside, see the high cost to park, but are wary of moving in case we can’t find a cheaper space elsewhere. We recommend doing your research before your trip, because the cost of parking up by the beach can mount up, especially if you’re visiting for a few days, with prices varying greatly within one area. "If you are able to walk a little further, first try the less expensive parking which is normally a little further away from the main beach area. Choose wisely and you’ll have more money to spend on the things that matter most.”
