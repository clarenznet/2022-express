Nadiya Bychkova and Kai Widdrington looked more loved up than ever as they cemented their couple status while attending the opening night of The Car Man at the Royal Albert Hall. The professional Strictly dancers grinned as they cosied up to one another for snaps. Nadiya stunned in a strappy navy number which hugged her toned figure. The Ukrainian star, 32, dazzled in a pair of black lace heels which matched the lace panel at the bottom of her dress. She wore her blonde tresses in her signature sleek style, while beau Kai, 26, looked dapper in a suit jacket and trousers which he paired with a plain white t-shirt.
