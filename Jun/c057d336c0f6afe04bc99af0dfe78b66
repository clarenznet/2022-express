Roland Garros was hit with a sexism row when only one women’s match was staged in the new night sessions - and Mauresmo claimed it was because men’s tennis has “more appeal”. Billie Jean King has called for men’s matches to be reduced to three sets to prolong the careers of older players. But former world No 1 Mauresmo, who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open, said: “They stopped playing the Masters Final in five sets just before I started playing in it and I was sad. I would have loved that. If you are one set down, you are a bit stuck. There are so many things that have to be factored in. And then you can say, Okay, it's a best-of-five. It will give me more time. "It would give me more time to roll out my game, perhaps to manage tension and stress. It's a different match altogether compared to the other ones. So I thought about this 20 years go. For the Masters nor for the women's Grand Slams, why not? "Why not think about doing this one day? I think that women's tennis would perhaps benefit from that, if it was the best-of-five. JUST IN: John McEnroe raises question over Nadal fears ahead of 'last match'  “This is what men do. We see them perhaps for longer hours, and maybe that's how we look at them in a more endearing way. Maybe that's something we can think about.” King, who received the Legion of Honour from Emmanuel Macron on Friday, said: “I have been saying forever we should only play two out of three sets. DON'T MISS  "As the players get older, I want them to be able to play. Nadal, do you want him to stop? I never want him to stop. "They create such a following in our sport. I want to make it possible for them to win. "I think three-out-of-five, you can lose by attrition. If you're older, it's harder.”
