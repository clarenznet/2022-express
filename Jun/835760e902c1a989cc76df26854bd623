"Offering some alternative fun alongside the street parties and celebrations for the Queenâ€™s 70 years on the throne, luxury bedroom specialist French Bedroom has partnered with Sussex-based print designer Elizabeth Ockford to hide a crown in the brand new Windsor Royalcore Wallpaper," reads the official description. "Recently launched, the limited edition wallpaper is inspired by regencycore interiors that have been prominent in recent art and culture such as Bridgerton and The Crown. "Nestled within a floral print which contains roses, lilies and cornflowers as well as ornate scrolls, the crown is evading the eyes of Brits." If you're struggling to find the hidden crown in the image above, then you may want to cast your eyes towards the left side of the design.
