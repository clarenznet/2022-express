Charlize Theron donned a new look as the actress chose to ditch her usual blonde tresses for another style. The 46-year-old, who is known for her luxurious blonde locks, went for a daring alteration to her look this Saturday. The Oscar-winning actress, who hails from South Africa, wore her hair in a mullet style to the star-studded event. She opted for a simple business casual look that included a white blouse tucked into a high-waisted pair of blue jeans.
