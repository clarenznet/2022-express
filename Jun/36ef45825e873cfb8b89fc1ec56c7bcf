But perhaps the signs of fracture were clear in the book itself - her latest of five - Celebrating The Seasons With The Yorkshire Shepherdess. The tome paints Clive, 67, as a grumpy, angry partner. The mum-of-nine, 47, says he called her a "daft bat" for wanting to improve her exercise regime and flew into such a rage when he fell over that the family never spoke of it again. The book details the huge list of responsibilities she has in the running of Ravenseat Farm - which features in the Channel 5 hit Our Yorkshire Farm - and tells how she cooks the meals for her massive brood. There is no mention of Clive helping with the shopping or cooking, and she admits she feels lonely on the moors. She also says she and Clive tend their own flocks and he raged at her for bad driving. Of the scores of family pictures in the book, which combines farm anecdotes with her recipes, there is only one small snap of Clive. Amanda reveals Clive sees her love of horses as a "frivolous hobby" as he believes animals "need to be contributing to farm life to earn their keep". On Clive's disdain for her efforts to shed baby weight, she says in the book: "In 2019 I decided as I'd been pregnant and/or breastfeeding for the last 20 years, it was time to start a tougher fitness regime. 'Yer a daft bat, thee!' he (Clive) said, shaking his head." When they competed together in a race she said Clive flew into a rage when he fell over while she overcame its obstacles. "I didn't know whether to feel elated from the run, dejected by Clive's comments, or laugh at how funny it was." In a joint Instagram statement this month, the couple said: "Clive and I are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate. "This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family."
