Ioan Gruffudd, 48, made a joyful public appearance yesterday with his new girlfriend Bianca Wallace, 29, as they attended the 61st Monte Carlo TV Festival together. The couple took to the red carpet in style, with Ioan looking dapper and grinning from ear to ear in a classic suit and bow tie, while his partner stunned in a show-stopping floor length cut-out green dress. Their appearance comes after Ioan’s estranged wife, Alice Evans, set up a GoFundMe page to help raise $25,000 (£20,500) for her divorce fees. In a lengthy heartfelt message, she pleaded for contributions as she was left "unable to buy anything”. The statement read: "Hi there. I never in a million years thought I would be doing this. "Until recently everything appeared to be going well in my life. I had a wonderful husband and two brilliant kids who had cost us the earth in IVF but were so worth it! "However in August 2020, just as the pandemic was really kicking in, my entire world fell apart. "Since that date, I have been not only struggling as a single mother to my babies, but also trying to cover bills and food and legal fees (ha! don't even talk to me about legal fees) which dwarf any other expense in my life and have finally drained everything - savings, accounts, pension, the lot." Express.co.uk has contacted a representative for Ioan for comment.
