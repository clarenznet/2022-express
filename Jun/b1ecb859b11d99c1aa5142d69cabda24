This stunning picture shows the glorious reddish-pink glow of the spectacular moon behind The Needles off the Isle of Wight. A supermoon occurs when a full moon reaches its closest point to Earth along its orbital path. As a result, it is much more visible in the sky, appearing larger and 15 percent brighter. The strawberry supermoon gets its name from Native American times when it was used as an indicator that wild berries were ripe for picking. Technically, it peaked on Tuesday at 12.51pm BST when the sun and moon were on opposite sides of the Earth. But conditions were just right for seeing the lunar spectacular on Tuesday night, with clear conditions. Around the world it is also known as the hot moon, mead moon and rose moon. The next full moon is on July 13 and is known as the buck moon. It will also be a supermoon.
