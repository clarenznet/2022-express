Jamie Redknapp’s wife Frida shared a heartfelt tribute to her husband to mark his 49th birthday. The 38-year-old posted a series of snaps which included the couple posing on a boat. Frida looked beautiful wearing a red, floral maxi skirt paired with a yellow bikini top, alongside Jamie who posed in his swimming shorts. Frida also included a sweet snap of the footballer with his youngest son, Raphael. She wrote in the caption: “Happy Birthday Sötnos. What a smashing guy you are, inside out. Cool, super funny, silly, handsome, kind, an amazing daddy to your three boys and the best husband! Love you lots! Have the best day.” Jamie has two other sons – Beau, 13, and Charley, 17, - with singer Louise Redknapp, 47, but she remained silent as her ex celebrated his birthday.
