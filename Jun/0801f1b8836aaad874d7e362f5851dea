Soccer Aid star Damian Lewis, 51, said goodbye to his late wife Helen, 52, in April last year - and he has now posed alongside a beautiful portrait of her as he launched the McCrory Award in her memory. The award is designed to help cash-strapped young people with an aptitude for the arts fulfil their dreams in spite of financial woes. Damian managed to raise a slightly forlorn smile as he proudly remembered her, while dressed in a simple but effective outfit - a black button-up shirt with pale grey loose fitting trousers. Meanwhile, he was surrounded by snaps of Helen with her many celebrity friends, part of an exhibition to raise money for the Hubert von Herkomer Arts Foundation. Other famous names pictured include Eddie Redmayne, Helena Bonham Carter, Benedict Cumberpatch, Sadie Frost and Sienna Miller. Damian will also be raising money for the charity UNICEF soon.
