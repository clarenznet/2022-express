Julia Fox risked accidentally flashing her underboob as she donned a daring skimpy leather top. The 32-year-old actress wore an all-burgundy ensemble last night as she stepped out in New York City. Julia showed off her toned abs as she attended the MADE Class of 2022 Group Show at Brooklyn Bridge Park. She complemented the one-shoulder crop top with matching straight-legged trousers and a floor-length matching coat.
