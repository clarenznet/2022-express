Some people may find some pox spread as far as their genitals. Monkeypox usually does not require intervention or treatment, with most people held in isolation during their illness. The disease spreads via bodily fluids, including liquid from ruptured pox, blood and mucus. Mild infections should subside after a few weeks without treatment, but severe cases may warrant intervention. Severe monkeypox may see some of the lesions caused by the disease expand, causing large tracts of skin to fall off. The extent of symptoms depends on intersecting factors, including age, comorbidity and other underlying conditions. Aside from the smallpox vaccine - which prevents rather than treats approximately 85 percent of infections - there is no treatment for monkeypox. Approximately three to six percent of people who contract monkeypox will die.
