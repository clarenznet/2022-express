Pensioners splashed out £319billion, 54 percent of all consumer spending, in 2018 - and this could increase to £550bn (63p of every pound) by 2040. But retailers have to make town centre shopping easier for older customers by opening more public toilets and offering more seating, among other improvements, according to the International Longevity Centre (ILC) think tank. Director David Sinclair said: "The demography of the high street customer is ageing, and retailers and planners have long failed to adapt or recognise the diversity of older consumers. "Older people complain that their needs are ignored. Public toilets have been closed, cafes and shops blare loud music, public spaces and shops rarely have anywhere to sit, and public transport is poor or non-existent. For our high streets to survive, they must become more inclusive. "They needn't just survive - they could thrive, playing a role in tackling loneliness. Inclusive environments are often a cost-effective way to prevent worsening health among an ageing population."  The ILC points out that the spending power of Greater Manchester households aged 65-plus is increasing by £280million each year. Making local town centres more appealing to them could boost high street spending by a further £50million annually. The ILC has launched a two-year project to transform how the retail sector sees and serves older consumers. In advance of the Second Reading of the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill in the House of Commons, the thinktank argues that supporting healthy ageing is key to levelling up. But in the first half of 2019, 1,234 more high street stores were closed than were opened, according to international tax specialists PwC.
