Laura Dern, 55, put her youthful looks on display last night as she attended the Jurassic World: Dominion premiere. The actress stunned fans in a contrasting outfit consisting of a bright orange skirt and an azure satin blouse. She accessorised the look with a black belt that cinched her in at the waist and pendant earrings. Laura’s ageless complexion was enhanced by a light layer of make-up and a bold, auburn lip. Her blonde tresses were styled in a chic ponytail with two loose strands framing her face. The event took place at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, and saw Laura’s co-stars also make a stellar appearance. Laura first appeared in the Steven Spielberg franchise as Ellie Sattler in the 1993 movie Jurassic Park and reprised the role in the 2001 sequel Jurassic Park III.
