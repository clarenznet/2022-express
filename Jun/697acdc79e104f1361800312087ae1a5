Trooping the Colour is a momentous occasion in British culture, with today being especially significant as the Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee. In 2014, almost two-year-old Prince George attended his first Trooping the Colour. He looked adorable in a baby blue romper. The little Prince also wore white socks and baby blue shoes. He perfectly complemented his mum, Kate Middleton, who wore a Catherine Walker dress, in Astrid design. READ MORE: Kate vs Queen Maxima: Who wore Roland Mouret better? But Prince George's outfit was rather familiar. It wasn't the first time a royal baby had worn the beautiful blue romper to celebrate Trooping the Colour. In 1984, 31 years prior, Prince William had worn the exact same romper on the balcony with his family. The photos of Prince William holding Prince George bear an uncanny resemblance to the photos of Prince Charles holding Prince William more than three decades before. Prince William too was just shy of his second birthday. The only difference was their shoes, with Prince William kitted out in black shoes instead of blue. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took to Twitter on June 13, 2015 to show the pictures of father and son side by side in the blue rompers. The royal pair captioned the photos: "Prince George's first appearance on the balcony wearing the same outfit his father wore at HM's Birthday Parade 1984." Royal fans were delighted to see Prince George wearing such a special hand-me-down from his father. The tweet received nearly 6,000 retweets. @Allan_Lunn said: "Proud grandad proud dad.
