The Queen’s granddaughter, 33, joined tens of thousands of festival-goers at Glastonbury to enjoy the music and the party vibe. She was spotted alongside her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, but an embarrassing incident occurred during their attendance at UK’s most popular festival. The royal stopped to buy some drinks at a luxurious restaurant in Glastonbury. There, after queueing up along with other ravers, the Princess tried to pay for her goods with a card, and it was declined not just one, but three times. The incident happened at the Pony Bistro restaurant, Daily Star reports. A source told Daily Star: "She tried to pay by card but it got declined three times" at the Michelin star restaurant. Beatrice, who is the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, attended the festival that took place after being cancelled for two years during the pandemic. The Princess and her husband dressed casual as they arrived at the festival on Friday to enjoy the first official day of music. Beatrice wore a khaki shirt dress, chic sunglasses and white plimsolls for the occasion. The dress appeared to be trimmed with gold thread along its edges.
