 Kate Hudson, 43, took to Instagram on Tuesday afternoon to promote her high-end footwear brand, Stuart Weitzman. The star flaunted her figure in a mini white bikini.  To match the bikini, she also wore a pair of sparkling silver heels, as the model stood posing, showing off her toned legs and washboard abs.  The two-piece suit featured high-waisted bottoms and a scoop neck top.  Kate’s Stuart Weitzman heels were a sparkly silver pair which included two straps running over the top of her foot.  The Almost Famous actress also had her wavy blonde hair flowing down her chest, as she went makeup free from the promo post before slipping into a stylish black pencil dress.
