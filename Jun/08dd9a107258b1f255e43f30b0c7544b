Maxwell, 60, “should not bear all the punishment”, they told a Manhattan federal court. She was convicted last December on five charges including sex trafficking. Judge Alison Nathan is due to pass sentence on June 28. Maxwell’s lawyers said she gets death threats from other inmates while awaiting sentence and this too should mean she serves less than the 20 years recommended by probation officials. They suggested that five years was enough.
