Salma Hayek, 55, stunned fans in a series of unearthed photographs from one of her red carpet appearances in the 90s. The Frida star dazzled in a skintight bandage dress that put her famous curves on display at the 1997 premiere of Speed 2: Cruise Control. The white midi dress featured spaghetti straps and blue and silver detailing, which matched Salma’s metallic strappy heels. The brunette beauty opted for styling her hair in a side part that showed off her natural curly locks.
