She hopes to attend a number of events over the next few days to mark her unprecedented 70 years on the throne but she is unlikely to be at several of the key Jubilee celebrations. Buckingham Palace is expected to issue regular updates to confirm whether she will be seen at others. The 96-year-old monarch is currently intending to stay away from trooping the Colour, which will kick off four days of official celebrations in the capital tomorrow. She is expected to remain at Buckingham Palace during the ceremony, where Prince Charles will take the salute on nearby Horse Guards Parade and be joined by the Duke of Cambridge and Princess Anne. But the Queen is expected to emerge on the balcony to take the salute from returning troops of the Household Division immediately afterwards and then come out on to the balcony again with the working members of her family for an RAF flypast later. She hopes to be at St Paul's Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving for her reign on Friday where Prince Andrew and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected among the wider Royal Family in the congregation. On Saturday, it looks increasingly likely she will not make it to the special Jubilee Derby at Epsom. It has not been ruled out completely yet but those close to her believe she will stay in Windsor, watch the race on television and spend more time seeing her great-granddaughter Lilibet, whom she has not met yet, on her first birthday. There has also been some speculation that Lilibet could be christened while she is at Windsor but there is no confirmation. The monarch is thought highly unlikely to attend the BBC Platinum Party at the Palace concert taking place on Saturday night. However, there is a chance that she may see the finale of the Jubilee Pageant, which finishes at Buckingham Palace, on Sunday afternoon.
