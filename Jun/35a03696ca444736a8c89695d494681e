Edward Putman, 54, was given three months to hand over £940,000 or face six years jail on top of the nine he is already serving for the scam. He has failed to pay anything but still owns a £700,000 property, it was said. Putman tricked Camelot in 2009 with a bogus ticket made by insider Giles Knibbs, 38, who later killed himself. A former friend of Knibbs said yesterday: "There's no way he should be allowed to get away with it. When he is released, he may well have access to millions." Putman, who was jailed for raping a teenager in the 1990s, went on a spending spree but was unmasked after claiming housing and income support. When he was jailed in 2019, the sum left for confiscation was £939,782. Accounts suggest more than £1million is unaccounted for.  A document released Picture: Steve Bainbridge under the Freedom of Information Act confirms "to date the full confiscation order amount of £939,782.44 is outstanding". The Crown Prosecution Service said Putman, of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, had got a three-month extension. Sources said there are "a range of options" prosecutors could then consider. Putman claimed the win using a ticket forged by his pal Knibbs, who worked at Camelot's fraud detection unit. He had printed 99 tickets with the winning £2.5million numbers, each with a unique two-digit "checksum" figure. Putman then went to 29 shops before a successful checksum match was found in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. He then called Camelot just days before the six-month limit was set to expire, claiming he was "having palpitations". They paid out on the deliberately crumpled ticket, even though key features including a barcode were missing, it was said. Evidence suggested Knibbs was paid £280,000 by Putman, followed by much smaller increments totalling £50,000. After the win, Putman flew first class around the world and was said to have invested in properties in Florida and Malta. Putman claimed he was a "genuine winner" at his fraud trial.
