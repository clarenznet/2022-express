It may not be the weekend just yet, but at least there's a new Wordle puzzle to keep you busy until Friday. Wordle 376 is live for the next 24-hours, so you'd better hurry and figure out the answer, especially if you want to keep your streak alive. If you need a little help solving Wordle 376 for June 30, then head to the bottom of the page for a selection of spoiler-free hints and clues. Good luck, because you might just need it! The word game that would spawn a thousand clones, Wordle is the perfect game for when you have ten minutes to spare and need to relax. The concept is extremely simple, challenging players to figure out a five letter word in just six guesses. To do so you'll need to use the process of elimination to rule out different letters. If, for example, a letter tile turns grey after one of your guesses, you can deduce that this particular letter doesn't feature in today's word. If a tile turns yellow, then the letter is in the word, just not in the right place, while a green tile means the letter is in the word and in the correct position. The aim is to solve each puzzle in as few guesses as possible. You can then share your progress on social media, showing friends, family and random followers exactly how brainy you are. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the following day for a new Wordle to be released. And because the Wordle site tracks your statistics, failure means losing your hard-earned winning streak - something you'll be reminded about every time you login.
