The genocidal dictator adored Hastings-born Winifred Wagner and they remained close all his life. Hitler was also a devotee both of Wagner’s music and his anti-Semitic writings. His January 1933 note said, ominously, that he was involved in “difficult and hard work” – days later he swept to power as Chancellor, which led to the Second World War and the murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its allies. He also wrote, on his personal stationery, that Christmas had been “only a season of sorrow for me” – yet fanatical Nazis changed the words of carols to praise him. Winifred Wagner, called “honoured and dear Wini” by Hitler, died in 1980, aged 82. The letter will be sold by International Autograph Auctions Europe of Estepona, Spain, on July 13.
