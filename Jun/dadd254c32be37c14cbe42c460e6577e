The 2022 Formula One season heads into round eight this weekend with the Azerbaijan Grand Prix but there are plenty of talking points within the world of F1 ahead of the sport's return to Baku. Lewis Hamilton’s future in F1 has been questioned by Jenson Button as the seven-time champion continues his poor start to the campaign. Button claims it’s possible his old McLaren team-mate Hamilton wants to ‘do something else’. His comments come after Helmut Marko, Mika Hakkinen and Jacques Villeneuve were among many questioning his future in recent months. Mercedes has struggled to match the pace of frontrunners Ferrari and Red Bull all season but Hamilton has appeared to be more off the pace than new team-mate George Russell. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen has warned rivals he has ‘unfinished business' at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The Red Bull star crashed out of the race last year and has never scored a podium at the Baku track. Follow the latest F1 updates from Express Sport below...
