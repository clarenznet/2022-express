Charlene, Princess of Monaco stepped out with her husband Prince Albert on June 17 in a stunning green one-shoulder Lanvin dress. The gown had a flared hem, causing the Princess to look like a Hollywood star from the 1920s. But what jewellery did Charlene wear?  One noticeable piece that was missing from Charlene’s glamorous attire was her engagement ring. Charlene has been married to Albert since 2011 but has only been seen wearing her ring a handful of times. Instead, the Princess covered herself in a selection of pieces by Van Cleef & Arpels. Her earrings and left-hand bracelet came from the Palmyre collection from Van Cleef & Arpels.

Charlene’s bracelet is comprised of 135 stones weighing a massive 18.8 carats. Another piece of jewellery that Charlene wore was very poignant. The Princess chose against wearing her engagement ring, which she hardly wears anyways.  Instead, she was seen wearing her Cartier Trinity ring. What was the hidden meaning behind this ring? This Cartier Trinity ring was an anniversary gift from her husband, Prince Albert, according to the Instagram page Royal Couturier. The piece retails for a whopping £2,090 and has been seen on the Princess’ finger for many years.  It is set with five brilliant-cut diamonds totalling 0.04 carats. Its width is just 3.5 mm but is such an elegant-looking ring for Princess Charlene. Royal fans took to social media to praise Charlene’s jewellery choices. Instagram user @kerryburgio said: “She has the best earring collection of any royal.”  Another account, @keratiadiamonds added: “Stunning designs by Van Cleef & Arpels!” Royal fan @suecatinella commented: “Princess Charlene looks beautiful.” Another royal watcher wrote: “Queen of elegance.” Instagram account @maca_m_ said: “Jewellery with a very modern design that is in line with the Princess’ sporty nature.”
