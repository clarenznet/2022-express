Phill Buckland was travelling to work on the Metrolink tram from Didsbury, Manchester when he spotted a pigeon sitting in the hood of a fellow commuter at around 9am today (June 6). At one point during the video, the pigeon appears to peck the back of the man's head, but he remains unmoved. Despite the pigeon's surprise appearance on board the tram, Phill says the other commuters did not say anything about it, reports Manchester Evening News. "I was watching quite a hardcore documentary about a new drug in Colombia," said Phill. "When I looked up, I happened to see the pigeon staring me in the face. "The man was just sat there with the pigeon sat in his hood. I think it was a tame one. "No one said anything but it's pretty hard not to notice it. I think he must have walked in front of a few people when getting on the tram."  Phill says the man got off the tram at St Peter's Square, with the pigeon still sat in the hood on his way out. "It's funny," Phill added. "It's a good way to brighten up a Monday morning. When I lived in London there was a guy with a parrot on his shoulder on the tube, but obviously the Manchester version is a pigeon."  Metrolink byelaws state that animals are not allowed on Greater Manchester's trams, with the exception of guide dogs or hearing dogs. A trial allowing other dogs on board the Metrolink was suggested earlier this year - although it is unlikely any new policy would extend to pet pigeons. Animals have been banned from travelling on the Metrolink ever since it was launched on July 17, 1992.
