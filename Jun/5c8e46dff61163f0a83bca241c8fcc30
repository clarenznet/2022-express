The government announced last month plans to introduce new legislation to rip up parts of the hated deal, such as removing checks on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland. The Protocol-busting Bill had been scheduled for today but has been delayed due to turbulence within the Conservative Party.

Mr Martin said that is it "perfectly reasonable" to look for ways to improve the operation of the protocol but accused the UK government of "bad faith" efforts to undermine it. In a speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday, the Irish leader said unilateral action by the UK would "mark a historic low point, signalling a disregard for essential principles of laws, which are the foundation of international relations".
