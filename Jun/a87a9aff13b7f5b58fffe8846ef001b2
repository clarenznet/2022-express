There were 16,170 "contacts" between families and the Care Quality Commission watchdog in 2021, up three percent on the year before. This year the figure stands at 6,437 or 46 every day. The crisis - exacerbated by families being banned from visiting their sick and dying loved ones - prompted campaigners The Relatives & Residents Association to write to the regulator demanding action. The CQC said it does not record contacts as "complaints". It said not all of them represent grievances but it did probe concerns raised. Meanwhile, the continuing Covid care home visiting scandal has prompted 60 MPs to write to Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid about the "severe impact isolation has caused".
