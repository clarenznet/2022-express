For this month, two lucky individuals took home the £1million jackpot which is widely sought after by bond holders. For June, the first winning Premium Bond number drawn was 281YT705546 and it was purchased by someone from Essex. This jackpot winner currently holds £10,001 in Premium Bonds and bought the winning bond in September 2016. According to NS&I, this particular winner became the 19th millionaire chosen by ERNIE from Essex. June’s other winning Premium Bond number drawn was 464SG223887 with the lucky winner originating from Kirklees. This individual holds £50,000 in Premium Bonds and purchased their winning bond just in July 2021. After this win, this person is only the second Premium Bonds millionaire to come from Kirklees.

NS&I reports that these prizes were worth over £137million, with many winners taking home smaller amounts. As part of the lottery, over 118 billion bond numbers were eligible for the prize draw. Recently, NS&I increased the prize fund rate for Premium Bonds from one percent to 1.40 percent which came into effect for June’s draw. In light of this decision, the odds of each £1 bond number winning a Premium Bonds prize will also change from 34,500 to 1 to 24,500 to 1. Explaining this hike, Ian Ackerley, NS&I’s chief executive, said: “The new prize fund rate ensures that Premium Bonds are priced appropriately when compared to the interest rates offered by our competitors. “It also ensures that we continue to balance the interests of savers, taxpayers and the broader financial services sector.” Since June 1957, when Premium Bonds were initially launched, ERNIE has picked out 567 million prizes which have a total value of £23billion. Those who invest in Premium Bonds with the financial institution are in the running to win the £1million. Premium Bonds is a savings product which is managed and created by NS&I, a Government-supported bank. For many savers, it is regarded as a safe investment opportunity due to it being backed by HM Treasury. Unlike other savings accounts, no traditional interest is earned on Premium Bonds. Instead, there is a monthly prize draw for tax-free prizes. There are multiple high value prizes savers can win via the product, the most famous being the £1million jackpot which is won by two people every month. Other prizes which are up for grabs are £100,000, £50,000 or £25,000, with smaller payouts also available to be won. Among the high value prizes someone can win through lottery are £1million, £100,000, £50,000 or £25,000, with smaller payouts also up for grabs. Winners are chosen randomly by ERNIE, which is otherwise known as Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment.
