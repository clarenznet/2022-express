Max Verstappen leads the drivers’ standings by 21 points as the Formula 1 World Championship heads to Montreal for round nine at the Canadian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton has been warned not to act like a “pantomime dame” after the Mercedes star complained of back pain at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The former McLaren F1 star also appeared to take a swipe at Hamilton’s private life. Watson warned the seven-time champion needed to spend “less time in the air and more in the gym” to ensure his body was strong enough to handle the vibrations. He warned Hamilton could be going through a “seven-year itch” as he praised George Russell for his strong start. Martin Brundle has sided with Christian Horner and claims the FIA should not intervene with porpoising issues, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff appeared to call for changes to the regulations ahead of the race in Baku while Horner has warned against such a decision.  Instead, Brundle has stressed Mercedes could fix their issues by raising the car, as suggested by Lando Norris after the race. Meanwhile. Ferrari have confirmed they are working on a “short-term fix” to the mechanical failures that plagued the team in Baku for this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. Posting on Twitter, the team also confirmed they were working on longer-term fixes to the issue for the rest of the season.
