Richard Madeley's wife Judy shocked the world when she announced she would be taking a step back from showbiz. Fans have been accustomed to seeing the pair present as a couple after they fronted Channel 4's Richard and Judy show for over eight years, and ITV's This Morning for a decade. Judy briefly returned to the celebrity circuit at the races today, accompanied by Good Morning Britain host Richard, who wore a pale blue shirt and beige suit combo. Meanwhile, Judy dazzled in a white dress covered by a floral patterned jacket with pink and peach splashes of colour. In true Ascot style, Judy also boasted a fashionable hat, and white sunglasses to match. It comes after Richard, 65, previously explained that although his 73-year-old wife has decided to retire from being on-screen alongside him, they are still very much together behind the scenes. He has jokingly described their situation as being "semi-detached".
