The past week - one of the worst for pollen allergies in recent years - saw patients bombard surgeries wanting priority access for treatments. The reality is they could be dispensed quicker and easier by high street pharmacies. One family doctor had at least 10 requests for urgent appointments for hay fever on a single day. He added: "That would be nearly a whole GP session taken up." All his patients were directed to a pharmacy as every remedy was available over the counter. But there was "so much kickback due to the cost and a lot of verbal complaints". He added: "There are drives to refer people to pharmacists, but we get so many people refusing to engage because they know we can get it free if we prescribe." The surge of hay fever sufferers to GPs adds to problems facing local doctors. The Express revealed this month patients failed to attend 4.5 million appointments between January and April. This cost the cash-strapped NHS some £175million - more than £1.4million a day - over those four months.
