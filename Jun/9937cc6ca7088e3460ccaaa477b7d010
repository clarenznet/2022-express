Jeff Goldblum, 69, put on a youthful appearance with his young wife Emilie Livingston, 39. The pair were spotted at the Prada Spring/Summer 2023 Menswear Fashion Show in Milan last night. Jeff looked dapper in a black suit, paired with a patterned striped tie. Meanwhile, his gymnast wife Emilie looked lovely in a white oversized shirt style mini dress. The dress featured a feathered hem that highlighted her long and toned legs. Emilie's dress also featured sheer panels on the sleeves and a baby pink pattern strip in the middle.
