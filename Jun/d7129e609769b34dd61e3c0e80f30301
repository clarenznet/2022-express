Piers Morgan’s son, Spencer Morgan, 28, poked fun at his dad with a Father’s Day card that mocked his dramatic Good Morning Britain storm-off.The comical card featured a cartoon of Piers midway through his walk-out with the words: “Happy Father’s Day.“Thanks for never walking out on me.”Spencer shared a snap of Piers holding the card and added the caption: “Happy fathers day to the only reason I’ve got some followers. Keep annoying the right people.”He completed the post with two adorable childhood photographs which saw a youthful Piers holding his son.
