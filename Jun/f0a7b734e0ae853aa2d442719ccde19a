Emma Thompson looked the picture of elegance as she attended the Sundance Film Festival in a perfectly-fitted white suit this evening. The iconic actress, 63, looked radiant as she posed for snaps at the film event in London where she attended the Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, premiere. The white blazer showed just a hit of decolletage and featured buttons which were done up to showcase her incredible curves. Emma's matching, straight-legged trousers finished just below her ankle. The Harry Potter star wore her silver tresses in glamorous curls as she wore a soft face of natural looking makeup which included a pink lip.
