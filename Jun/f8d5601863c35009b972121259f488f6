 Johnny Depp looked relieved and happy as he posed for a photo with musicians Sam Fender and Jeff Beck. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor was no doubt celebrating winning his defamation trial against Amber Heard. He was awarded $15million in damages, while she was awarded $2million after the jury reached their verdict earlier today. Hypersonic Missiles singer Sam branded Johnny and his crew “serious heroes” as they smiled for the camera. Moments before the highly-anticipated result of the six-week court case was read out, Johnny was spotted outside a pub in Newcastle. He released a statement through his spokesperson, in which he said he finally had his life back and felt “truly humbled”. Johnny said he had been “overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and the colossal support and kindness from around the world”. “I hope that my quest to have the truth be told will have helped others, men or women, who have found themselves in my situation, and that those supporting them never give up,” he continued. “The best is yet to come and a new chapter has finally begun. Veritas numquam perit. Truth never perishes. “
