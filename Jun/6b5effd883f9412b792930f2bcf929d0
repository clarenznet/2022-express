Trooping the Colour is the first day of celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee weekend. Camilla looked stunning at Trooping of the Colour this morning. The Duchess donned a pale blue and purple dress. She paired this with a large, wide-brimmed hat in the same colour. She looked chic and stylish as ever. The dress is by Bruce Oldfield. Her statement hat is by Philip Treacey. The Duchess of Cornwall kept her jewellery class with simple pearl earrings. She wore one of her signature multi-strand pearl necklaces.  This is the Four-Stranded Necklace with Round Diamond Clasp. Camilla can often be seen sporting this beautiful jewel at daytime engagements.
