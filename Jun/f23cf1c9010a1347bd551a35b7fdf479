Millions of Britons have hit the beach as Friday is declared the hottest day of the year so far, smashing 30.7C at 11am. Temperatures are expected to increase between 12pm and 3pm, when the Mercury will be at its hottest, before dropping off again. The NHS has declared a Level Three heat-health watch alert, with a warning to take extra care to stay cool as temperatures rocket. Those who are at risk are being urged to stay out of the direct sunlight in the hottest hours of the day. Much of the country will be sweltering in extreme heat by the afternoon, with central parts of London predicted to hit 35C. The alert will remain in place until midnight on Saturday, June 18 - meaning both Friday and Saturday are set to be blistering hot. But thunderstorms are expected to swoop in on Sunday (June 19), bringing with it cool air and some much-needed relief for some. THIS BLOG IS NOW CLOSED
