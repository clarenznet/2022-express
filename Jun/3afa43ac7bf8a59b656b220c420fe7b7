In a video address to the G7 summit, he urged the group of allies not to let conflict in his country “drag on over winter” when brutal weather conditions will hamper the fight. President Zelensky insisted “if Ukraine wins you all win” and called for more weapons for his country. He said Ukraine will not back down by handing over parts of the country to Russia in return for peace. “We will only negotiate from a position of strength,” he told the gathering at the Schloss Elmau resort in the Bavarian Alps. He wants extra defence systems to combat the missile bombardment suffered by Kyiv and other cities in the days before the summit.   The Ukrainian premier will also address the Nato summit, which opens on Wednesday in Madrid in his push to keep up momentum for support from the West. Mr Johnson and Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau sent a video message of support to President Zelensky ahead of Monday's speech. They hailed the “heroic fight” he is leading against Vlaidimir Putin and said they were stepping up economic, financial and military support.  Mr Johnson said: “So our message to you Volodymyr and to the people of Ukraine is: we salute your fight, we believe it’s wholly, wholly legitimate and essential for our world, we support you and we will stay the course.” In a joint statement, the G7 leaders promised to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. They said: “We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. “As we do so, we commit to demonstrate global responsibility and solidarity through working to address the international impacts of Russia’s aggression, especially on the most vulnerable.”
