Rafael Nadal has made even more history after becoming the oldest man to win the French Open title in thrashing Casper Ruud in Sunday's final. The Spaniard barely got out of first gear as he won 6-3, 6-3, 6-0.  Ruud was competing in his first major final against the 'king of clay' and never really looked comfortable against the tennis icon. Nadal came into the final having never lost in the showpiece match in 13 previous attempts at Roland Garros. That didn't look likely to change from early in the first set as Nadal kept his unforced errors to a minimum. In contrast, Ruud struggled to build up any momentum with Nadal proving exactly why he's undefeated in Roland Garros finals. There was a small chance for Ruud in the second at 3-1 up, but Nadal quickly stepped up a gear to win five consecutive games and take the second. From there, it was a procession from Nadal as Ruud appeared to go through the motions and accepted defeat was inevitable. And he finished it off in style, winning the final set with a begal to mark his historic achievement. Follow Express Sport's LIVE blog for updates on the French Open final
