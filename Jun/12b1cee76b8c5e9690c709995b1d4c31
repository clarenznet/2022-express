The Antique Pearl Tiara is made of diamonds and large pearls and is a favourite of the Dutch monarch as she has been seen donning the piece on many occasions. The brooch was the Diamond and Pearl Devant de Corsage. Made in the 19th century, the jewel features a large diamond bow from which a pearl pendant is suspended.  A diamond-studded chain hangs from the main brooch with a smaller diamond bow brooch and additional pearl pendants. The brooch also contains several rare pink diamonds. Sophie of Württemberg, a German princess who married King Willem III of the Netherlands in 1839, was the first royal who wore the piece. Royal watchers were impressed with Queen Maxima's gorgeous look with @lesleywarron saying: "So gorgeous."
