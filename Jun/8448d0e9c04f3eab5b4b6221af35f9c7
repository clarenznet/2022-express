Women’s golf star Karrie Webb fears Greg Norman’s LIV golf series may threaten her beloved LPGA. The 59-year-old has made it clear he wants to get further involved in the women's game and with Golf Saudi already playing a significant role on the tour, Webb is rather concerned. "I know that he's had this vendetta against the PGA Tour as long as I've known him," she said, as quoted by USA Today. "So I don't think there would be any changing him. I would just ask him that in his ambition to succeed, that he doesn't ruin women's golf in the process." Saudi Arabia has been criticised for their human rights record and back in May, Norman was condemned for his words on the matter. This prompted the American to tweet: “The little girl in me just died well and truly!! Has anyone's childhood hero disappointed them as much as I am now??” As we know the LIV golf series is a lucrative eight-tournament circuit worth £200million and aims for a quicker, more attractive version of the game - like T20 cricket - to appeal to a younger, wider audience. The competition is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is furthering its western sports investments after purchasing Newcastle United last year.

Why is it OK … that there’s a Saudi sponsor, Aramco, the largest sponsor of women’s golf in the world? Why is it OK for them? Why is it not OK for these players? “Will [PGA Tour commissioner] Jay Monahan go to each and every one of those CEOs of the 23 companies that are investing into Saudi Arabia and suspend them and ban them? … The hypocrisy in all this, it’s so loud. It’s deafening.”
