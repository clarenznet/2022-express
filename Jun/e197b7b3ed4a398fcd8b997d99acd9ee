Lewis Hamilton has hit out at a social media troll who attacked Sky Sports' appointment of ex-W Series racer Naomi Schiff. However, Hamilton came to her defence as he warned Schiff had been a “great asset” on screen. He said: “Naomi is an ex-professional racing driver & totally qualified to give her opinion as part of the Sky team." Meanwhile, Ryanair has blasted Charles Leclerc after the Ferrari star missed his flight to Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix. The Ryanair Twitter account replied to Leclerc’s message about missing his flight in a hilarious exchange. They said: “He’s a 5, but he doesn’t fly a private jet. He’s a 10 for us.”  Finally, F1 has struck a new deal with the Australian Grand Prix rewarded with a 10-year extension. It means the race will remain at the Melbourne street circuit until at least 2035, extending its stay to almost 40 years. There was some competition for a race in Sydney but Melbourne was retained because of the commercial deal available.
