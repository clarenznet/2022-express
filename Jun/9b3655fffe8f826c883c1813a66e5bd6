Dominic Raab says it will also enable the Government to ramp up deportations of foreign criminals. The Justice Secretary is introducing proposed legislation after the European Court of Human Rights grounded the Government’s flagship policy for asylum seekers who arrive in unauthorised journeys. The Deputy Prime Minister wants the successor to the Human Rights Act to assert that British courts do not always need to follow the court in Strasbourg. Instead, the legislation states that the Supreme Court in London is the ultimate decision-maker on such issues. The Bill would create a permission stage in court where claimants must show they have suffered significant damage before their case can go ahead. This is designed to reduce “trivial” proceedings. The move would also seek to restrict the circumstances in which foreign-born people convicted of crimes are able to argue their right to family life out-weighs public safety in a bid to prevent their removal from the UK. They would have to prove their child would come to overwhelming and unavoidable harm if they were deported under the plans, which need the approval of Parliament. Mr Raab insisted: “The Bill will strengthen UK tradition of freedom while injecting a healthy dose of common sense into the system. “These reforms will reinforce freedom of speech, enable us to deport more foreign offenders and better protect the public from dangerous criminals.” But Mr Raab stepped back from demands from some Conservative MPs to pull out of the ECHR. European human rights judges triggered fury last week by grounding the first Rwanda migrant flight only minutes before take-off. British judges had slapped down appeals from migrants but the European Court of Human Rights got an injunction over the removals. The Rwanda plan could now be grounded for weeks, or even months – though Mr Raab is understood to be confident flights could soon be underway.
