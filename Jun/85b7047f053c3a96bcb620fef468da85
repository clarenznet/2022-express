Andy Murray contests his first grass-court final for six years today as he takes on Matteo Berrettini in the Stuttgart Open. The Briton is seeking a first title on the surface since winning Wimbledon in 2016 and victory over the Italian in Germany would provide an incredible foundation for this year's Wimbledon, which begins later this month. Anticpation is reaching fever pitch after Murray started to show the kind of pre-surgery form which fans have been craving for years, despite his recent victory over the enigmatic Nick Kyrgios being coated in controversy. The Aussie imploded at the end of the first set and the start of the second as Murray secured a 7-6 6-2 triumph in 91 minutes. After a closely-fought first set, in which Kyrgios was on fine form, Murray clinched the tiebreak 7-5, prompting the 27-year-old to smash his racket on the court and his bench. He received a point penalty for his actions, followed by a game penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct just moments later. Now, Murray returns to the heart of the action looking to add a final victory to his resume ahead of the Wimbledon showpiece.
