The Countess looked radiant while seated beside her husband Prince Edward and their two children Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.  Sophie wore a white and pink gingham suit and matching pink hat as she waved at the crowds while passing in the carriage. The carriage drove the family to Horse Guards Parade, where they joined other members of the firm, to watch the day's events. The crowds began gathering on the Pall Mall outside the Palace this morning ready to welcome the Queen back on the balcony for the first time since 2019.  After the parade, Sophie will make her way to theÂ Buckingham Palace balcony, where she will stand alongside the Queen, her husband and children, and the other working royals for the RAF flypast. The Wessexes will be some of the few Royal Family members to be featured on Buckingham Palace balcony this year. While in the past, the balcony has included upwards of 40 people, this year it will be a much smaller group. It comes after the Palace announced that only working royals will stand on the balcony at the service. MORE TO FOLLOW..
