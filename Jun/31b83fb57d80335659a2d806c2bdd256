  Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp, 50, took to Twitter today to hit back at the men celebrating the overturning of Roe vs Wade. The overturned law significantly sets back women’s abortion rights in the US.        Kirstie, who is pro-choice, called out the men who were cheering online in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision. In view of her 428,000 Twitter followers, Kirstie wrote: “The number of men dancing around on Twitter thrilled by the reversal of Roe versus Wade makes me want to vomit. “Please pipe down, you are NEVER going to have to make this choice.” Kirstie was not the only high-profile person to speak out on the issue, with plenty of famous faces from both sides of the pond weighing in.

Kirstie’s fellow celebrities also expressed their outrage as the news broke yesterday that US lawmakers had decided to make abortion illegal in parts of the USA. The landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case made abortion legal across America and now, nearly 50 years later, that progress has been reversed.        Women in some states could now face prosecution if they get an abortion, which has sparked a massive debate about what this will mean for women’s freedoms. Billie Eilish even took time out of her Glastonbury headlining set yesterday to address the shocking news. The singer said: “The song we’re about to do is I think one of the favourites that we’ve written and it’s about the concept of power and how we need to always remember how not to abuse it. “And today is a really, really dark day for women in the US. I’m just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer at this moment.” READ MORE...
