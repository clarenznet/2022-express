She said was alarmed to learn that when the parents returned home one of them "stumbling" because of the drink. Taking to Mumsnet, the woman asked users if they thought she was being unreasonable for wanting more for her child, reports The Mirror. In a post, she wrote: "There are a lot of other issues with this family but recently found this out...the first time my child (12) went for a sleepover at her friend's house the parents told them around 8.30 pm they were 'going to the office' (15/20) mins away. "Anyway the dad came back two hours later and his children asked where's mum. 'At the pub' he said. "The mum in my child’s words 'stumbles in' later slurring saying 'Sorry it's been a s**t night I think I have Covid" she was p**sed up. "So basically they hadn't entertained the kids at any point just lied they were going to the office at 8.30 at night and f***ed off to get p**sed. "She had left my child and her friend (12) and their other child (9). Keep in mind she has to get babysitters for her kids when they go out. "I'm p**sed off. This is just the final nail on a big f**k off coffin with these people. "When I have sleepovers I cook, try and plan activities etc if the kids want to but I would never in a million years leave someone's child unattended!! Especially at night time! The kids are only really just 12. "I've not said anything yet for the kids sake but should I? Apart from this, the woman is honestly unbearable anyway....this incident happened a few months ago before any other incident. "I didn't know her beforehand as it's a friend my child made when starting secondary school.” People were divided, with some parents backing the furious mum, but others saying that the children could be left alone for a few hours at that age. One wrote: "Contact safeguarding at school about her kids and never let yours stay over again." Another suggested: "I'd encourage future sleep-overs to be at your house in future, regardless. Just tell them you really enjoy hosting and they may be grateful.” One argued: "It's not right, but I don't know why you expect parents to entertain 12-year-olds at a sleepover. "At that age, even before that age. I'd expect the kids to just do their own thing in their rooms or whatever.” "You are being unreasonable to let your child stay with them in the first place”, one harshly wrote. Another parent wrote: "In my opinion, 12 is an appropriate age for children to be left on their own for a few hours. "Granted the doors are locked, they know how to safely use and switch off appliances and know who to contact in case of an emergency. "However, It was inappropriate of the mother to get p**sed up and return shouting about Covid in front of the children. "If you’re uncomfortable with the whole setup, don’t allow your child to sleep over there again. Or wait until she’s a couple of years older like 14 or 15 to sleep there again.” "You’re obviously very upset about this, so just be thankful your child is now safe in your care. Just don’t allow your child to go there again," another suggested.
