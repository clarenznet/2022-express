Abemaciclib, made by Eli Lilly, cuts the chance of the disease coming back once a tumour has been removed. It is suitable for those with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who have had surgery.  Results from a clinical trial showed those on abemaciclib who had hormone therapy had a 30 percent greater chance of being cancer-free if they had surgery too. Charity Breast Cancer Now welcomed the move by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to offer women the drug.
