 Environment ministers from the European Union’s 27-member states agreed to a range of measures to tackle climate change after lengthy discussions. After 16 hours of negotiations, policymakers agreed to phase out new fossil fuel car sales as of 2035.  Ministers supported core parts of the package that the European Commission first proposed last summer, including a law requiring new cars sold in the EU to emit zero CO2 from 2035. That would make it impossible to sell internal-combustion engine cars. The deal makes it likely that the proposal will become EU law. The outcome states: “The Council also agreed to introduce a 100 percent CO2 emissions reduction target by 2035 for new cars and vans.” READ MORE: EU car ban: MEPs vote to ban all petrol and diesel car sales  Lofty goals have been set by the European Union to reduce net emissions by 55 percent from 1990 levels. The European Union is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. Also in the agreement was a requirement to impose CO2 costs on polluting fuels used in transport and buildings, which should launch in 2027. This included a €59billion (£50.8billion) fund to protect low-income citizens from the policy’s costs between 2027 and 2032.

This was seen as a major win for environmentalists, with one calling it a “real success for industry and climate”. Of a total of 612 votes, 339 were in favour of the proposals, while 249 MEPs rejected, alongside 24 who abstained. The UK Government has set out plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030, with a similar ban affecting hybrids launching five years later.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania wanted to delay the plan to effectively ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The group of countries wanted to delay the proposals for another five years, until 2040. Based on papers circulated among EU states, the five countries called for a 90 percent cut by 2035 and a 100 percent target by 2040. Similar targets were set out for light commercial vehicles too.  They argued they should meet an 80 percent CO2 cut by 2035 and 100 percent by 2040, rather than the 100 percent reduction in 2035 proposed by the European Commission. One Bulgarian official, who did not want to be named, said climate policies need to take into account different economic and social factors between EU countries. Germany has also been sceptical of the deal, with Finance Minister Christian Lindner saying that the Government would not agree to the plans. He said there would continue to be niches for petrol and diesel cars, so a ban was wrong.
