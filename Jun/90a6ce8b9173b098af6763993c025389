It was another in the actor's series of surprise appearances in cities across the UK as he appears alongside rock legend Jeff Beck on tour. The 58-year-old dined out at Varanasi in the city's Broad Street but he has also been seen in Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield in recent weeks. It follows the Pirates of the Caribbean star's successful defamation lawsuit against former wife Amber Heard last week. Depp was awarded Â£8.2million in damages but missed the conclusion after joining Mr Beck in the UK. The actor booked out Varanasi for Sunday evening's curry feast washed down with champagne. It included a three-course dinner of chicken tikka shashlik, vegetable samosas and a king prawn starter for Depp, Beck and about two dozen members of their crew. Operations director Mo Hussain said: "He was very humble and stayed to talk and greet everyone. They spent a lot of money but never looked at the bill." Meanwhile, Depp was not the only big name from the US enjoying a meal in Britain. Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, speaking as a guest of ex-Labour MP David Miliband, who organises an annual lecture in his former constituency. They went to eat at Colmans, a fish and chips institution. Mrs Clinton posed for photos with owner Richard Ord. His son, co-owner Richard Ord junior said: "It was surreal but she was so down to earth."
