NS&I announced the June prize draw winners yesterday and has since updated its prize checker app. Savers can now check to see if they’ve scooped a prize ranging from £25 up to £1million. Premium Bonds have been popular with savers since they were first launched in the 1950s not least because they offer Britons the chance to win £1million every single month. Two lucky people woke up £1million pounds richer yesterday while many others could be sitting on cash prizes worth thousands. June’s winners from Essex and Kirklees will both receive £1million. The first winning bond, 281YT705546, was purchased in September 2016 by someone from Essex, who holds £10,001 in Premium Bonds.

The total prize money paid out by National Savings and Investments (NS&I) in the 65 years since the very first draw in June 1957 comes to £23billion. People can check the app to see if they’ve won a prize in the June draw or any month during the last 65 years. Typically, winners are informed but if they moved address they may have an unclaimed prize waiting for them. When the first Premium Bonds prize draw was held in June 1957, the jackpot was just £1,000 instead of £1million. Jill Waters, NS&I Retail Director, said there are many reasons to celebrate Premium Bonds this month. She said: "Firstly, we were pleased to announce the increase of Premium Bonds prize fund rate from one percent to 1.40 percent, effective from this month’s draw, which will see an extra 1.4 million prizes paid out. “The 65th anniversary of ERNIE's first draw is also a momentous occasion."

Britons are urged to check if they have won anything as there is an estimated £74million left in unclaimed Premium Bond prizes.
