Sofia Vergara, 49, is known for her jaw-dropping curves and killer looks and today's Instagram post from the actress was no different. Her husband Joe Manganiello, 45, took to Instagram to share a selfie of the happy couple both sporting matching blue hair. Sofia looked jaw-droppingly beautiful in her small pink bikini top as she posed for a mirror selfie, with vibrantly dyed hair. Jason appeared to be in the gym, showing off his ripped arms, with a bold blue mohican. He captioned the picture in view of his 2.6 million followers: "Blue is better S/O: @poemmanganiello." Sophia was quick to respond: "Jajjajaja si." (sic)
