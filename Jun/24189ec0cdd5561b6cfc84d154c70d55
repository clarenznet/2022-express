The cancer campaigner, known as Bowelbabe, was pictured sipping a refreshing drink with Heather, 64. Her mum, known as Bowelgran, posted a snap to Instagram with the caption: "A lovely relaxing lunch in the sunshine." Deborah was in a wheelchair looking out onto the waters of Pyrford Lock at The Anchor pub in Woking. The 40-year-old podcaster, who was diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer in 2016, is receiving end-of-life care at her parents' home in Surrey. But the mum of two is doing the things she loves including attending Royal Ascot and the Glyndebourne opera recently. Her Bowelbabe fund has so far raised £6.7million for cancer research, with a further £1million from the sale of her Rebellious Hope T-shirt. Deborah wasn't the only one enjoying the weather, as sunseekers yesterday revelled in heat that hit a high of 82F (28C) at Heathrow airport.
