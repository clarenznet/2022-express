Yesterday, 25 Labour MPs took to the picket lines alongside Arthur Scargill, who is known for leading the famous miners' strikes when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. Mr Johnson said that the Conservatives have been helping working people by getting people off welfare into work and cutting transport costs while Labour are on the picket line "literally holding hands with Arthur Scargill." He continued by saying that Labour under Sir Keir Starmer is "worse than Jeremy Corbyn". He added: "This is a government that is taking this country forward, they would take it back to the 1970s".
