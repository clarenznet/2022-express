You'll likely find life a lot easier in the UK if you have a mobile phone - not just for communicating with friends, family and your sponsor, but also for enjoying everything the country has to offer. Some restaurants or pubs accept orders by logging onto an app, and QR codes are dotted around the high street. If you're just arriving in the UK from Ukraine, you're in luck as some mobile providers are handing out free mobile phone SIM cards to see you through. Three UK has removed roaming charges anywhere in Ukraine, and all calls or texts from the UK to Ukraine are now free. Ukrainians arriving in the UK can grab a free 30-day Pay As You Go SIM card from Three. The card will include unlimited domestic calls, texts and data. Simply head to one of the UK's 311 Three stores to collect your SIM card. Once your 30 days have expired, it's time to get your mobile phone contract. You can either head directly to the network provider you're interested in (whether it be O2, EE, Vodafone, Three, and more), or head into a Carphone Warehouse store. Carphone Warehouse has deals with a number of network providers, meaning it's easier to compare prices. If you need to provide an address for the contract, you could use your sponsor's address for the time being. Similarly, to help cover the cost of the contract, there are a number of schemes available. You're eligible for Universal Credit - a payment made to everyone of working age on a low income - as well as Pension Credit. Your local JobCentre Plus will be able to help you gain access to these benefits.
