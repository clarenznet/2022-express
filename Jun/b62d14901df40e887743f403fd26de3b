The station was closed for 45 minutes following the evacuation, which took place at around 2.30pm. Transport for London (TfL) have confirmed it was closed due to a fire alert. The London Fire Brigade responded to the emergency. Twitter user @usdew described the experience of the evacuation as "alarming" but "admirably British". He said they had been "hurried out" by staff. The user added that the evacuation was "very efficient, though alarming. We were last through the gate before they shut it and forced everyone behind us to rush for the other exit." He went on to joke: "No stampedes or screaming. All admirably British." Travellers were urged to re-plan their journey. Tickets for the Tube train were being accepted on London buses. The Tube station is served by the Jubilee, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines. The TfL website states all three still ran a good service aside from the closed station. With over 35 million people passing through it over the course of a year, Green Park is one of London's busiest stations. Close to Buckingham Palace, it offers a scenic walk past St James's Palace to the historical site. While Green Park was evacuated safely, in 1987 a fire alert at King's Cross station did not end so well. A discarded match on the wooden escalator for the underground station caused an enormous blaze. This led to the deaths of 31 people, as well as 100 injured. Prior to this event, staff on the underground had reportedly been given minimal training on how to deal with fires. New fire safety regulations were introduced as a result. This included wooden escalators being replaced with the metal ones we know today, and proper training for staff to tackle any such emergencies.
