But, armed with a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label whisky for Her Majesty, Scotland's First Minister made sure things were happy and glorious. The two looked pleased to see each other as the 96-year-old monarch received SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh yesterday. The Queen, who has suffered mobility problems, stood without a walking stick as she greeted Ms Sturgeon - but a purple bruise could be seen on her right hand. She had noticeably purple hands when she met former defence staff chief General Sir Nick Carter at Windsor Castle in November. Ms Sturgeon later paid tribute to Her Majesty, praising the "life and service of an extraordinary woman." Hours earlier, she announced a Bill for a consultative vote on a "legal, constitutional" independence referendum - which could lead to a break-up of the Union - on October 19 next year. The SNP has insisted it would retain the monarchy and remain part of the Commonwealth after independence, but there are strong republican roots and leanings among the party's senior figures. After her meeting with Ms Sturgeon, the Queen held an audience with Scottish Parliament presiding officer Alison Johnstone. The monarch carries out Holyrood week engagements in Scotland every year. On Monday, she attended the historic Ceremony of the Keys - the traditional opener to Holyrood weeks - accompanied by Prince Edward, 58, and his wife Sophie, 57. She then met Armed Forces members during an act of loyalty parade.
