The Duke of York, 62, tried to persuade the monarch to restore his status as blood prince which would see him return to official events alongside other royals. He has reportedly been lobbying for his daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, to be made working royals. A source said: “The colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards was his most coveted title and he wants it back. Having remained a Counsellor of State, he also believes he should be included at royal and state events.  “Most importantly for him is his status as an HRH and ‘Prince of the Blood’ and he feels that should be reinstated and his position recognised and respected.” The Queen’s third child will appear alongside senior members of the Royal family at the annual Order of the Garter ceremony at Windsor Castle. It comes after he made a controversial appearance at Prince Philip's memorial service, escorting the Queen to her seat. However, he missed the Platinum Jubilee celebrations last weekend after contracting Covid 19.  The Queen has reportedly held secret talks with Andrew and senior royals to discuss his role. In February, the Duke paid around £12million to settle a civil case with Virginia Roberts Giuffre who accused him of sexual abuse. He has always denied any wrongdoing.
