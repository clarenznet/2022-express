Stags will also be out in force, however, Bath has always been more appealing to hens, Somerset Live reports. In fact, this summer they will outnumber their male counterparts by 10 to one. Combined with soaring temperatures, the city's popularity means it will soon be full to bursting. Last Night of Freedom, a firm offering hen and stag dos, gave its view on the numbers. "This year, Bath has cemented itself as one of Britain’s premier hen party destinations," said Matt Mavir, its managing director. "According to our industry data, we expect there to be more hens heading to Bath than typical hotspots like Dublin, Prague and Amsterdam. There’s been an explosion in bookings this summer, but we’ve seen around 75 per cent of those trips being for British towns and cities, which is great news for the likes of Bath.  "But it is also set to be busier than the likes of Blackpool, which fits in with an industry trend we are experiencing in that hens want a more upmarket weekend, and are willing to spend more for experiences, activities and accommodation in order to make memories with their closest friends that they can really cherish. “The only shame is that more stags aren’t heading to Bath. There’s a reputation for it being a hen party town, but it is an immense location for men too. It has great pubs and bars, and you can do everything from racing quad bikes to life drawing."
