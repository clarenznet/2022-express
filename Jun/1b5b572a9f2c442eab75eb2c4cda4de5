Greenwood was initially released on conditional bail, which was due to expire this month. However, he is now set to remain on bail in the wake of Thursday's hearing, with the news having been confirmed by Greater Manchester Police via an official statement."Following a hearing yesterday (Thursday 23 June 2022), a 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and making threats to kill on Sunday 30 January 2022 remains on bail," read the statement.Greenwood was arrested shortly after pictures and videos were posted online by his alleged victim back in January, with United having already confirmed that he will not be available for selection or allowed to take part in training with his team-mates until further notice.
