Emergency services brought the man out of the crowd and rushed him to hospital after he suffered a medical episode on Saturday evening at Download Festival, a rock and metal event at Castle Donington, Leicestershire. Medics rushed into the throng moments before Iron Maiden took to the stage for their headline performance. Police are now investigating what happened. One witness told Leicestershire Live: "It happened just before Iron Maiden came on. I noticed people were shouting and then paramedics were going back and forth to help whoever it was. "It was during the first song that they were taken away. I don’t think many people realised what was happening at first." The tragic death is currently being treated as unexplained.  A spokesperson for Leicestershire Police said today: "We can confirm the death of a man who had been attending the Download Festival in Castle Donington at the weekend," said a force spokesman. "The man became unwell at the festival on Saturday evening (11 June) and was taken to the Derby Royal Infirmary where he sadly died. "The death is currently being treated as unexplained and enquiries remain ongoing." No further details about the man, including his age, have been disclosed by police at this stage. One person wrote on Facebook: "This is such terrible news." The tragedy came hours after East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) and the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland Air Ambulance were dispatched to the festival to reports of a medical emergency involving another festival-goer. Reports suggest this medical incident was on a festival campsite. "We received a call at 12.49pm on Saturday 11 June to Castle Donington, Leicestershire, to assist with a medical emergency," said an EMAS spokesman. "The air ambulance was in attendance and assisted medical teams on site."
