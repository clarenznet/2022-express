Dame Joan Collins, 89, elegantly led the procession of Dames during yesterday’s Platinum Jubilee Pageant as the nation celebrated Queen Elizabeth II’s 70 years on the throne. The legendary Hollywood star could be seen waving and smiling at royal fans on the Mall in a video shared with her 277,000 Instagram followers last night. Dame Joan captioned the video: “A momentous and #unforgettable day, the likes of which we’ll never see again #platinumjubilee @platinumjubileepageant @theroyalfamily #thankyou #queenelizabeth” For her appearance during the Dames in their Jags section, Dame Joan was accompanied by her husband Percy Gibson, 57. Dame Joan was the epitome of glamour in a pale pink ensemble that featured a fascinator and a long scarf, along with some lavender gloves. Percy looked elegant in a light grey suit and silver tie, with a lavender shirt to match her wife’s outfit. In a separate post in which she could be seen sitting in a car, Dame Joan thanked designer Philip Treacy for creating the “wonderful” hat she wore for the special occasion.
