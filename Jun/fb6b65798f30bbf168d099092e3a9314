Why are there no do-gooders blockading French highways, stopping these people from heading to the coast? The answer is that France doesn’t want them any more than most decent citizens of the UK do. Oh, and, of course the European Court of Human Rights just happens to be in Strasbourg, which is in France. There is no more to be said. Robert Goddard, Ashford, Kent -------------------------------------- Lawyers are in charge but nobody voted for them We vote for a party, it wins but it can’t govern because its policies are blocked by lawsuits. It now appears that lawyers are running this country and I don’t remember voting for them. They make a fortune from the public purse while costing the UK a fortune with their actions. It is an affront to the normal people of this country and democracy. Dana Wiffen, Bexley, Kent -------------------------------------- Throw down the gauntlet to France over refugees Why can’t the Government get the European legal system to understand that refugees are the responsibility of the first safe country they enter? How come France is not censured by the European Court of Human Rights for its continued failure to meet its responsibilities? Robbie Barnes, Milton Keynes, Bucks -------------------------------------- Judge for yourself who is actually running country Can someone please explain how the Government can propose a solution to the immigration crisis and get it approved but then lawyers can continually appeal until they find a judge who doesn’t agree? Who runs this country? John Evans, Waterlooville, Hants
