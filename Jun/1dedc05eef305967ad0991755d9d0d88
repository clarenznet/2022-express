Rafael Nadal secured a historic win over Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals of the French Open to set up a mouthwatering last-four clash with Alexander Zverev after a four-hour battle with his Big Three rival at Roland Garros. The Spaniard needed a fourth-set tiebreak to see off the challenge of Djokovic and wrap up a gruelling victory over the world No 1 in a match that will live long in the memory of all those involved with the sport. Nadal came flying out of the blocks to clinch the first set under the lights in Paris, with the 13-time French Open winner employing an aggressive and no-nonsense approach to ease into the lead. He managed to break Djokovic twice on his way to the post as he rolled back the years to the approval of the partisan crowd in attendance. The Manacor native broke again at the start of the second set to put himself in control but was quickly pegged back by Djokovic, who did incredibly well to edge a highly-competitive and lengthy affair in order to draw level. Nadal, however, came out swinging in the third set and raced to another commanding triumph before he managed to clinch a fourth-set tiebreak in spite of an impressive showing from Djokovic, who threw everything at his long-time rival but ultimately came up just short once all was said and done.
