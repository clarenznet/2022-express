Former flight attendant Nassim exclusively shared with Express.co.uk her tips to stay safe while holidaying abroad. The flight attendant admitted she doesn't always feel safe in her hotel room. She explained: "When I started flying I heard of a story where a crew member had gone into their hotel room and not checked it out properly and someone had hidden in the room. "They got attacked so every time I got to a hotel room I would use my luggage case to keep the hotel door open. "I then go inside and check everywhere.

"I would never ever enter a room without doing that," she explained. Nassim said some hotels don't have chains for the door "so we just rely on the lock". "So I would place my bag by the door.  "In case someone would open it from the outside so that it would make a noise." The flight attendant explained this is a good hack in order to acknowledge someone is entering your room straight away. The crew member shared other things travellers should always do to stay safe abroad. She explained: "I would also make sure to never get in a lift with just one person and press my floor. "And make sure no one is following you to your room. "If you are feeling unsafe wait in the lobby until they have gone. "Only then, proceed to go to your room especially if you are on your own." Nassim added: "I would always also put no room service on my door to avoid having anyone come in." The crew member recommended always using the room safe. She said: "I did use the safes as well for my important documents and money. "Always, always use that!! "I always leave my tv on as well so it seems like I am in the room at all times," she added.
