Serena Williams is looking to right the wrongs from last year's WimbledonÂ after an injury in the first round saw her campaign end in disaster. The American legend only recently returned after 12 months out and is playing in her first Grand Slam since her unfortunate exit at Wimbledon last time around. The 40-year-old, who has won seven Wimbledon titles across her illustrious career, may have played little tennis over the last year but still appears to be aiming to go all the way. When asked what would be a good outcome for her, Williams said: "Oh, yes. You know the answer to that (smiling). You guys know the answer to that, so... "I don't know. I have high goals, but also -- I don't know. We'll see. I'm not going to answer that." Williams, who also refused to rule out this being her last Wimbledon, kicks off her campaign on Centre Court against France's Harmony Tan. THIS LIVE BLOG IS NOW CLOSED.
