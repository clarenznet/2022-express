He also brushed off reports that Tory MPs were continuing to plot against him in the wake of last week’s by-election defeats. Asked if he was concerned about events at home, Mr Johnson said: “We settled that a couple of weeks ago.” However, it emerged last night that three Red Wall Conservative MPs are in defection talks with Labour. They are believed to be dissatisfied with Mr Johnson’s leadership of the Tory party. Under current rules he is supposed to be safe from a leadership challenge for another year and says he still wants to serve a third term as prime minister. He said: “I not only have the authority, I’ve got a new mandate from my party, which I’m absolutely delighted about.”
