Sir Shirreff explained why the UK had to play catch up as the war had been going on in Ukraine since 2014, not February of this year. The ex-NATO commander discussed the consequences of not ensuring that Russian President Vladimir Putin is defeated. Sir Shirreff claimed there will be no peace in Europe while Putin still lives in the Kremlin.
