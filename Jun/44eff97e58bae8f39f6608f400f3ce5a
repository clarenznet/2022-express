Tom Cruise, 59, landed in South Korea today to continue the promotion of his latest film Top Gun: Maverick. The Hollywood actor waved to crowds of fans who waited for him at Gimpo International Airport in Seoul. Tom looked amazing in the tight-fitted beige polo shirt, leaving his ripped arms on full display. He paired the shirt with navy jeans and smart black shoes and wore a pair of black shades. Tom seemed in high spirits as he chatted away with fans lining the entrance of the airport. The Golden Globe winner is still on the promotional trail for his new film but will take a break in a fortnight as he celebrates his milestone 60th birthday.
