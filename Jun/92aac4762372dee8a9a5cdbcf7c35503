The situation has led the media regulator Ofcom to look at whether to shake-up the television advertising rules. Ofcom is looking at the “frequency and length” of advertising on broadcast TV, which could see extra minutes set aside for commercials. Further product placement could also be added on screen into dramas and entertainment shows. It has led to fears that British television will become more like the US, which is renown for advertising breaks and commercial breaks, along with goods being seen in shows. One MP last night raised concerns the impact of additional advertising would lead people to “vote with their feet.” A broadcasting consumer group pledged that they would be “looking at this issue very carefully.” In a document this week, which looked at the relicensing of ITV and Channel 5, the media regulator said: “We are also looking at the rules that set the frequency and length of advertising on broadcast TV. “These rules are complex, with limits in place for public service broadcasters that are stricter than the rules set for commercial broadcasters. “We have had initial discussions with stakeholders, and we expect to be able to outline our next steps later this summer.” Ofcom will also look at the “trade-off between more adverts or instead allowing more product placement,” according to the document. It said: “On content subject to commercial arrangements, we are conducting audience research to gain a better understanding of attitudes towards commercial references in programmes and views on the potential trade-off between exposure to more advertising versus more in-programme branding.” Ofcom is also looking at whether the maximum minutes of advertising per hour remains at the right level or if it needs to be changed.
