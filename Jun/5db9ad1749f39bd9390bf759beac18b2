Record fuel prices putting drivers off [WARNING]  At the beginning of May, there were an average of 50,000 people checking the platform to see the latest prices, with around 3,000 entries logged for pump costs around the UK. Over the last week, more than 150,000 concerned drivers have been searching the platform for the cheapest prices in their area. For those using super unleaded, they face even steeper costs with RAC Fuel Watch showing average prices of 194.68p per litre. With prices “likely to rise”, drivers may see costs higher than the current price of £107.40 for an average tank.  Before the Jubilee bank holiday, prices stood at 174.02p per litre for petrol and 183p for diesel, showing the staggering cost increases in just over a week. According to the AA, petrol wholesale costs that had reached £1 a litre for the first time ever last week continued to be lower than in the run-up to the Jubilee bank holiday. They had gone above 153p a litre (including fuel duty, which is paid by retailers when they receive deliveries) on June 1 but were 148.51p yesterday and so far remain below 150p. The motoring organisation described the price rises as a “huge shock”, calling on the Government to act.  RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: “It’s a truly dark day today for drivers with petrol now crossing the thoroughly depressing threshold of £100 a tank (£100.27p). “It’s also important to remember that the Government is still benefitting from the high fuel prices by taking around 30p in VAT from every litre sold. “This compares to just 25p before Russia invaded Ukraine. “On top of this, the Government is still collecting 53p fuel duty from every litre.”
