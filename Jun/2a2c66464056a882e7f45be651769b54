The Loose Women panellist, 57, lip-synced along to one of Kim's SKIMS adverts where the reality star gushed over the "supportive" quality of the non-underwired bra. However, Nadia was quick to poke fun at the promotional video voiceover. Standing in nothing but a strapless black bra and matching pants, Nadia lip-synced along to Kim's voice as she captioned the clip: "Ditch the underwire with #skidsâ€¦ All the support a girl needs..." She lipsynced to Kim's voice: "I think that the myth of an underwired bra - I don't know if you have, like, big boobs and you don't think that non-underwired is supportive enough," she said while grabbing her breasts to her chest. "SKIMS has changed all of that," she pretended to gush while playing with her hair. The video went on: "Because it's all I wear, I don't wear an underwire anymore. "They are so supportive and lift," the clip ended as Nadia posed which her hands supporting her bosom.
