Dame Deborah James, 40, made sure she is making the most of the British summertime as she attended Royal Ascot today with her brother Benjamin James. The former BBC broadcaster stunned in a mini black and white polka dot dress, featuring puffed sleeves and a white collar. She styled the dress with studded cream pumps and a large straw hat. Deborah went for her signature smokey eyed makeup look, with blue eyeshadow. This comes as Deborah's cancer research fundraiser hit an amazing Â£6.7 million last weekend, with the money going towards helping Cancer Research UK, the Royal Marsden and Bowel Cancer UK.
