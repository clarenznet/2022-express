Kate Garraway, 55, and her 12-year-old son Billy headed to Capital’s Summertime Ball on Sunday. The pair were spotted sitting in the stands at Wembley Stadium eagerly awaiting performances from the likes of Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran and Sam Ryder. Kate and Billy attended the concert with a friend and were videoed dancing in their seats. The Good Morning Britain presenter looked summery in a floral midi dress with some sunglasses adorned with flowers. The outing comes after Kate revealed that her husband, Derek Draper, had recently returned to hospital, over two years since he contracted Covid in March 2020. She announced the news to her 1.1 million followers saying that she had been feeling “exhausted and fretful” and that she hoped the “wonderful health teams” will be able to help him.
