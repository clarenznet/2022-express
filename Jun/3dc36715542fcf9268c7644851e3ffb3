They need to be more visible and focused clearly on catching criminals in order to win back the trust of the public, he says. This is the kind of straight talking that the nation desperately needs. His comments will resonate with a British public that is tired of seeing the police failing to do the job that they are paid for. It's important to have the trust of communities, but the way to win that trust is to prevent and investigate crime, rather than focusing on what might be described as public relations. Police must also avoid carrying out tasks best suited to other agencies, such as dealing with mental health issues. Mr Cooke knows what he's talking about. Civil servants are under pressure to perform and many do an admirable job, but it does sometimes appear that they have an easier life than employees in the private sector. This is illustrated by figures showing civil servants are taking thousands of days off without providing a sick note. It seems that some of the rules people working for a business take for granted don't always apply to them. Jacob Rees-Mogg is battling to convince civil servants to get back to their offices and stop working from home, to ensure they are performing their important jobs to the very best of their abilities. Let's hope he turns his attention to this issue next.  ---------------------------- Dame Deborah James has published charming photographs of a slumber party with her 12-year-old daughter.
