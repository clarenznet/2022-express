Things that would have been simple pre-Covid, such as getting a replacement driving licence, are taking the DVLA months, and don’t get me started on how long it’s taking to get a passport from the Home Office. And even if you’re one of the lucky ones who manages to receive a passport, it doesn’t guarantee that you will get on that flight you booked and enjoy that summer holiday you paid for, as in post-Covid Britain we’re witnessing a catalogue of mismanagement and mishaps, a couldn’t-care-less attitude and, of course, people working from home. When we live in a society that requires government licences, permits and security checks in order to drive, fly, build or work, it means we need our civil servants in the office, busting a gut to process the paperwork which allows the wheels of the country to turn. Getting this great country back on track is going to take a monumental effort – and it won’t be achieved with key parts of the workforce working, or more accurately, not working from home. Surely it can’t just be me who sees how we have emerged from lockdown into a world that no longer functions properly and one where nobody seems to care. So when one of the country’s top civil servants argued that home-working had “precisely zero bearing” on the serious failings in the Passport Office, he was kidding nobody. Of course it has a bearing – a very big bearing. Work isn’t being completed on time, and the backlogs just grow longer and longer. How on earth can there be 91,000 more civil servants than in 2016 and yet such an inferior level of service being delivered to the public? Lockdown taught many people that you can sit at home and do nothing and collect 80 percent of your wages. Now, it seems some think they can do the same and collect 100 percent of their wages. We have got to snap out of this. Ending this working from home culture, where the work most certainly cannot be done at home, is definitely the best place to start.
