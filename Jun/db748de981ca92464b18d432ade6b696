The first day of the tournament has seen people queue for on-the-day premium tickets up to 48 hours before the gates open.Around 42,000 people are expected to attend each day over the next few weeks as it returns to full capacity for the first time since COVID-19. But fan @shroomtwo said the system is the "worst thing about Wimbledon" and the way other grand slams organise ticket sales is "so much better". Meanwhile, Twitter user @Tomtetom2 said: "The queue impresses me zero. it only shows that Wimbledon still has an outdated and backward ticketing system. to be honest it's just really embarrassing in 2022 and no reason to celebrate."
