Zara Tindall wore a hot pink dress to attend the Service of Thanksgiving today.  The royal looked very similar to Home Secretary Priti Patel. The Queen wore pink at her Silver Jubilee in 1977, so perhaps it was a sweet tribute to Her Majesty. Zara is wearing a Laura Green coat with a Juliette Botterill Hydrangea bow. Although this coat is no longer in stock, Zara wore an identical one from the same brand for £3,000 back in March. Zara's bow costs a whopping £550. She has paired these with a pair of Emmy 'Claudia' heels.  These cost an outstanding £415. The daughter of Princess Anne is also rocking her Aspinal of London Micro Lottie bag. This costs a sensational £395. For today's service, she was seen arriving wearing her Illesteva sunglasses and her Rolex watch. Royal fans took to social media to praise Zara's style. Twitter user @ChristinsQueens said: "Today is all about the pink!" Another fan, @QuynhMint14 added: "Always love Zara's style. Similarly, @Suzanne_Brmptn added: "Zara looks absolutely stunning today."
