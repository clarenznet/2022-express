Emma Raducanu and Andy Murray are stepping foot on Centre Court again for Day Three of Wimbledon 2022. The Grand Slam winners will be playing their second-round matches with Raducanu facing off against Caroline Garcia and Murray taking on John Isner. If you want to watch Wimbledon 2022 then you can tune into BBC One or BBC Two on your TV or alternatively you can head to BBC iPlayer which also are broadcasting Centre Court matches in 4K. The day's play on the SW19 main stage begins at 1.30pm with defending champion Novak Djokovic taking on Thanasi Kokkinakis. And then it will be the Brits to follow with both Murray and Raducanu facing tricky second-round opponents. Raducanu, who announced herself to the tennis world last year with a glorious debut at Wimbledon, is facing off against the unseeded Garcia. The 28-year-old will give the US Open 2022 champion a stern test, with Garcia coming off the back of her second French Open women's doubles win earlier this month. The Frenchwoman clinched the title once again earlier this month with partner Kristina Mladenovic. Murray, meanwhile, is playing the big-serving Isner who Wimbledon fans will remember as being the winner of an absolute marathon match against Frenchman Nicholas Mahut. That match, at the 2010 Wimbledon Championship, lasted for a staggering 11 hours and five minutes with the match being played over three days. Suffice to say, it's the longest match in history and it finished with a staggering 70-68 final set score. BBC will be exclusively broadcasting all the action from Wimbledon 2022. The biggest matches of the day include Emma Raducanu vs Caroline Garcia and Andy Murray v John Isner. Raducanu is on Centre Court second, with her match starting from 3.30pm and Murray is third on Centre with his encounter with Isner from 4.45pm. Wimbledon 2022 is being shown on both BBC One and BBC Two, with viewers able to press the red button to access matches from all courts. You will also be able to watch Wimbledon 2022 on BBC iPlayer, with all live Centre Court matches being shown in crystal clear Ultra HD. You will need to have an eligible 4K device (such as Smart TV that supports HDR) to watch Wimbledon in 2022. Alternatively, if you want to watch on the go you can tune into all the Wimbledon action via the BBC iPlayer app on your smartphone or tablet. It's worth noting that those who are away on holiday and trying to watch outside of the UK won't be able to use BBC iPlayer due to geo-location restrictions. This problem can be easily fixed though by using a recommended VPN (Virtual Private Network). For those on the market for a VPN subscription you can find our picks for the best deals around below...
