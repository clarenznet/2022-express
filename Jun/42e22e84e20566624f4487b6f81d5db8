Rose Ayling-Ellis, 27, who won Strictly 2021 with Giovanni Pernice, has wowed in a red bikini as she went off on a spa retreat for a reunion with one of her co-stars from the BBC dance show on Saturday. The EastEnders actress was joined by professional dancer Luba Mushtuk.  The pair wowed fans as they posed in their bikinis.  Rose looked astounding in her red bikini, while Luba looked just as beautiful in a black number.  They struck a playful pose, as Rose held the quirky ear flaps of her hat in the air, while Luba put on a supermodel pose as she lifted an arm behind her head.  "Finally back together and spending our relaxing / spa day at @banya.in.belgravia," Luba captioned the post, adding a raised hand and love heart emoji.
