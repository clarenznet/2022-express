Madonna, 63, posed topless today as she gave fans an exclusive look into her backstage preparations. The Material Girl hitmaker could be seen giving the camera a fierce look while wearing nothing but various sparkly necklaces. She covered her breasts with her long blonde locks, which were being styled by a hair stylist. The legendary singer performed yesterday a concert at Terminal 5 in New York City, which featured some of the hits included in her Finally Enough Love album. The upcoming album is set to be released on August 19 and will feature some of her best-loved tracks, including the iconic hit song Vogue.
