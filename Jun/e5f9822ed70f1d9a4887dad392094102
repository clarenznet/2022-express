Call centre workers are also reluctant, having just 19.5 days out. Across all industries, a full working week of time off is left unused. A separate study of 2,000 workers, also commissioned by RotaCloud, found one in five cited having too much work to take all their entitlement. And one in six worry about Covid restrictions, so still refuse to travel. Fearing a mountain of work prevents 16 percent from taking it easy. Pam Hinds, at staff management company RotaCloud, said: “Taking regular breaks from work is vital, for both your physical and mental health – so it’s really important to take your entire annual leave entitlement, no matter how busy it is at work.”
