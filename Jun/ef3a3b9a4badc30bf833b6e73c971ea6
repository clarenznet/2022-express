Camilla combined the long-sleeved midi dress with a stylish clutch bag. The cream handbag featured a colourful print. The royal finished her look with her favourite pair of shoes: the black and cream Chanel heels.  Camilla has been wearing the pair of shoes for years now and many have speculated the reasons why these are her favourite design. It is believed the Duchess of Cornwall loves Chanel as the brand logo features two Cs. A double C could stand for Charles and Camilla. In fact, Princess Diana refused to wear Chanel shoes for the same reason. Australian designer Jayson Brundson once explained: "I went through [all the shoe options], and I found a pair of Chanel shoes. "I said [to Princess Diana], 'well these would look great with the Versace [you're planning to wear]' and she said 'no, I can't wear linked Cs, the double C'. "So I asked why, and she said, 'it's Camilla and Charles'." Over 500 invited guests attended today's reception at Buckingham Palace. One of the last times Camilla was seen wearing her favourite pair of pumps was to meet Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A reception with G7 leaders was held at The Eden Project, in Cornwall, in June last year.
