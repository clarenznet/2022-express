In a glowing endorsement, Mr Zelensky added that Mr Johnson was "an important ally" and had shown support following the Russian invasion. The two leaders met in Kyiv in April and are known to speak regularly. It is understood that before the vote on Monday night, Mr Johnson spoke to Mr Zelensky to reiterate the UK's commitment to arming Ukraine in its resistance against Russia. Earlier this week, the UK followed America's lead by sending three longer-range rocket systems to help Ukraine defend itself.
