Three fairly lacklustre loan spells at Millwall, Ipswich and MK Dons have offered little to no hope that the prodigy will become good enough to offer back-up to Harry Kane. But with the England captain also undergoing failed loan spells before his journey to stardom, there is still hope for Parrott yet. And after impressing for the Republic of Ireland in their dominating 3-0 win over Scotland on Saturday evening - scoring and creating an assist - the Dubliner showed he could start to play a part in Antonio Conte's plans. And former comments by Mourinho suggested that such could happen by labelling him the 'privileged one'. “He already has two appearances in the Premier League which is something not very normal for an 18 year old kid, so he is a privileged one. And at the moment he understands the privilege he has to be training as part of the first team every day with experienced coaches and players, with very good people in the academy he is a privileged one. Step by step. “We take care of the players. Of course it was not my work but for Harry Winks to arrive into the position of club captain in a Premier League match shows what can be done in this club. A kid who comes here at nine, ten years old, is taken care of, comes into the first team, plays in the first team and then arrives at a moment where he even wears the armband. “Troy is in a process, a young kid with a lot, a lot, a lot to learn.” The striker has four international goals for his nation in just 14 appearances, and alongside fellow youth prodigy Michael Obafemi, the future looks exciting for Ireland.
