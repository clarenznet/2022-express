The pilot will run for six months from June 6 and won’t reduce employees’ pay - all while giving them a three-day weekend every week. It works on the basis that everyone involved in the scheme will get 100% of their salary for 80% of the hours, but with 100% productivity.

During the trial run, the businesses will work with researchers to record the impact on productivity. They will also track worker wellbeing and the impact on the environment and gender equality. A wide range of businesses and charities will participate in the study, including online marketing company Adzooma and the Royal Society of Biology.

Instead of reducing employees' hours, it made the four working days longer. Some companies have also trimmed hours down to give workers permanent 32-hour weeks with no loss of pay. Outside of the UK, four-day working week arrangements have been trialled across a number of countries including Iceland, New Zealand and Spain. According to a Microsoft Japan study conducted in 2019, the productivity of employees went up by nearly 40% when it trialled a four-day working week.     The company said meetings were more efficient, and workers - who were also happier - took less time off. More than 60 firms based in the UK will participate in the trial but not all of them have agreed to be publicly named. The employers that have been named so far include:
