Rita Wilson, 65, went solo on the red carpet after her and husband Tom Hanks were mobbed by an overzealous crowd. The actress attended the Songwriters Hall of Fame 51st Annual Induction and Awards Gala on Thursday. She smiled for the cameras wearing a black dress with matching leather jacket.  Rita's appearance comes after Tom defended her from a particularly aggressive fan telling him to “back the f*** off".  Tom and Rita were leaving a restaurant in Midtown when a large crowd swarmed them.  One member of the public got too close to Rita and knocked into her, causing her to fall over.  She looked towards her husband as she wobbled slightly and tried to regain her composure as she held up her hands and shouted: "Stop it!"  After rushing to see if Rita was ok, Tom then turned to the crowds and shouted: “My wife? Back the f**k up! Knocking over my wife?!” The couple then quickly ran into a waiting car.
