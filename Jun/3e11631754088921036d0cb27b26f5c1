A series of agreements means the UK and the Faroe Islands both have fisheries jurisdiction over a “special area” between the two countries. The Faroe Islands government last month banned Russian vessels from entering its ports. But the ruling does not apply to fishing boats. A UK Government source said: “The Faroe Islands should have taken a tougher stance on this. “Allowing Russian vessels access to an area worth around £16 million in the midst of the horrors we are seeing in Ukraine is simply wrong. “We, alongside our allies and partners, have taken urgent action to maximise damage to Putin’s war machine and degrade the Russian economy for years to come. “We will categorically not licence any Russian flagged vessels to fish anywhere in UK waters, and we will continue to urge the Faroes to follow our lead, ban these vessels, and do what is ultimately the right thing to do.” The government reportedly intends to introduce a 35 percent tariff on imports of white fish from Russia this month. Up to 40 percent of the whitefish on sale in Britain is caught by Russian ships, estimates from industry body Seafish suggested. In 2020, the UK imported 432,000 tonnes of whitefish at a value of £778million, meaning the money going to Russia is likely to be in excess of £200million. There are concerns that the rising cost of fish and energy could put chip shops across Britain at risk of closure. Andrew Crook, president of the National Federation of Fish Friers, said: "I know a lot of it's beyond the government's control but they do have some things that they can do to help operators like myself, that do everything right and pay the staff well, and try to do everything environmentally sound.” Aoife Martin, director of operations at Seafish, said: “We will continue to provide advice and guidance to businesses to help them to adapt to changes once further information is available.” The Faroe Islands government has been contacted for a comment.
