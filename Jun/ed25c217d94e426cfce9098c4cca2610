Mick Jagger, 78, reunited with his bandmates Ronnie Wood, 75, and Keith Richards, 78, at Giuseppe Meazza stadium in Milan on Tuesday. The Rolling Stones played for the excited audiences as the legendary rocker appeared to be in good spirits. Mick belted out their hits on the mic for his performance in black skinny jeans and a glistening pink bomber jacket, embroidered with lacy black designs. Ronnie also sported a colourful outfit in a crimson and turquoise jacket over a white graphic print T-shirt while Keith sported a yellow beanie with a purple button-up. Steve Jordan - who is touring with the band following the death of long-standing drummer Charlie Watts - looked chic in a black blazer suit.
