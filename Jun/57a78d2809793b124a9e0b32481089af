Spotify members have a new tool to play with thanks to the free Spotify Pie chart feature that launched this week. Like the popular Spotify Wrapped, the new Spotify Pie chart website lets people take a deep dive into their music streaming habits. The free-to-use site creates a pie chart that shows the different genres you listen to and which ones you turn to most, plus your most popular artists. To create your very own Spotify Pie chart, you just simply need to head over to the official website and log into your account. You'll then be presented with your very own interactive pie chart. When you hover over a slice of the pie chart you will find out which artists you listen to are from that genre.  The Spotify Pie chart website has been hugely popular since it first launched, with more than half a million people using it within the first two days of it being available. However, the new Spotify feature isn't the work of the streaming giant itself, it was actually created by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student Darren Huang. The Spotify Pie chart website isn't the only cool feature for the streaming service that was created by a third-party.  Receiptify was created by Michelle Liu who is an Information Systems and Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. As the name suggests, Receiptify analyses your Spotify history for the past month, six months or year and then shows your most listened to songs in the style of a shopping receipt. You can create your own Receiptify list by heading to the service's official website. You can use the tool with a Spotify account as well as an Apple Music account.
