The Daily Express witnessed the work on Hope Hostel in Kigali, which should have taken in its first migrants earlier this month. The hostel will hold up to 100 migrants across 50 rooms, each of which has two double beds, a desk, wardrobe and a limitless supply of free toiletries. Bosses at the hotel-style accommodation, which overlooks the beautiful rolling green hills surrounding the capital city, said they want the people arriving to feel "at home". Toys will be provided for any children. A play area will also be created, and staff are hard at work building a basketball court where football and badminton can take place. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We prepare for all eventualities and you can see we have prepared properly."  Those removed on deportation flights from Britain will be given three meals a day, including the option of a full English breakfast. On arrival, they will be tested for Covid-19 in a processing tent which also acts as a games room, with a pool table and plans for darts and table tennis. Those testing positive for coronavirus will be isolated. Each migrant will receive a monthly allowance of Â£90. Any troublemakers will be separated by guards and offered support services like counselling and medical attention, government officials and hotel staff said.
