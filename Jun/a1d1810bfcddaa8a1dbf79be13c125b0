Alexander Zverev has addressed the "very serious" injury he sustained on Friday which forced him to retire from the French Open semi-final with Rafael Nadal. The world No 3 had been in excellent form throughout the claycourt season and looked on course to reach just his second major final. The 'king of clay' was standing in his way of making it through to the final and the pair were embroiled in an intense match from the outset. Nadal ended up narrowly taking the first set in a tie-break and the second was heading for the same outcome. But just as Nadal won the point on his serve to force another tie-break decider, Zverev cried in pain as he appeared to roll his ankle. The German tennis ace writhed around in agony and his screams silenced the crowd inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. It was immediately clear that the injury was serious and he was unable to walk off the court on his own accord. Zverev ended up needing a wheelchair to bring him back to the medical room to assess his injury further, before returning minutes later on crutches to withdraw from the tournament.
