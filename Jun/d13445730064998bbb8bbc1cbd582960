Zara Tindall, 41, cemented herself as a "style icon" according to the ITV commentators today at Royal Ascot. The royal wore a buttoned collar dress with puffy shoulders that looked pale pink in colour. She paired this outfit with a bright monochrome full brim green hat. The hat also had a stunning pink flower on the side. Royal fans took to social media to praise Zara's style. Twitter user @BrowneyedBluen1 said: "Lovely to see Mike and Zara Tindall in the first carriage with the Princess Royal and Captain Laurence." Another fan, @SophiexJane added: "Absolutely love Zara Tindall's outfit, absolutely all of it.  "So, so lovely." Zara's dress was a long length pale pink number. The dress featured puffy sleeves and a top button collar.  The dress then featured fuchsia buttons down the front of the dress. The daughter of Princess Anne even styled the dress with a chic belt around her waist. Zara could also be seen wearing stud earrings in the shape of daisies. The blonde royal styled her locks in a curly way behind her ears. This ensured her bright hat was on full show. Zara attended the races with her husband Mike Tindall. Mike wore a pale pink shirt to perfectly match Zara's dress. He also chose a tie that was bright fuchsia in colour. This meant that the rugby player's outfit perfectly coordinated with his wife's gorgeous style.
