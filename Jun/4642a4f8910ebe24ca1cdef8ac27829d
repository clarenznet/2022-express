FIA technical delegate Jo bauer ‘stomped’ down the pits to speak to AlpaTauri as they tape uo Yuki Tsunoda’s wing, according to Karun Chandhok. The Sky Sports pit reporter claimed Bauer was walking towards Alpha Taurio just as Tsunoda left the pits with thick grey tape covering his DRS flap.  The Japanese driver’s rear wing was seen stuck half open which caused him to receive the black and orange flag. This forced the team to fix the car immediately and they used three bits of tape to dramatically fix the damaged part. Speaking on Sky Sports F1, Chandhok said: "I tell you what, Jo Bauer from the FIA has come stomping down the pitlane. Jo Bauer unfortunately got here about five seconds too late and the car had already skidded off. This may not be something the FIA are particularly happy with." Moments later Paul di Resta slammed Alpha Tauri's quick fix. He said: "You can't tape a wing like that!"  Tsunoda was battling with Sebastian Vettel with hopes of a top-five finish before the failure. After the pitstop, the 22-year-old came out 13th and was told he could not use his DRS. Since returning to track, the FIA has not issued any further statements in relation to the rear wing, suggesting they may believe the tape was legal.
