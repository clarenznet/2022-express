A No10 spokesman has said that the situation is being monitored very closely as hospitalisations are beginning to rise. But clarified that, due to vaccinations, deaths or ICU admissions have not increased. Over the seven days between June 16 and 22, a total of 101,157 new cases have been confirmed in England. This shows an increase of 33.9% compared to the previous 7 days. A total of 7,578 people went into hospital with coronavirus between June 19 and 25 in England, an increase of 39.5% compared to the previous 7 days. Today, 7,822 patients are in the hospital with Covid. Out of these, 192 patients require a mechanical ventilator. In the week between June 16 and 22, there have been 354 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. This shows an increase of 27.8% compared to the previous 7 days. The spokesman for Boris Johnson said: "We are obviously seeing the emergence of two Omicron sub-variants, which is likely the driving cause for the rise in cases." "The latest data suggest that these are now the dominant strains in the UK. "But, so far, vaccination means those rising cases haven't translated into a rise of severe illness or death with no increase in ICU admissions."

VOTE IN OUR POLL  Over 33 million people have been fully vaccinated in England so far, according to the official data. Over 39 million people are fully vaccinated in the whole of the UK, while the number of total vaccinations given in the country has surpassed 149 million. The spokesperson continued: "The key thing for us is vaccination has meant the rise in cases is not translating into ICU admissions and deaths. "But we've always been clear Covid hasn't gone away, which is why we have always continued to urge people to come forward and receive vaccinations when they were due them. "As you would expect, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) continue to monitor the situation very closely."
