Russians affected now cannot deal with UK banks and businesses or fly to Britain. They include Russian Children’s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, who is accused of enabling 2,000 vulnerable children to be torn from the Donbas region for adoption in Russia. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, and Sergey Savostyanov, the deputy of the Moscow city Duma, are two others. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Kirill has “repeatedly abused his position to justify the war” and declared: “We will not tire of defending freedom and democracy, and keeping up the pressure on Putin until Ukraine succeeds.”
