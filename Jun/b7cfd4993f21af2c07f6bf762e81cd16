Eagle-eyed Scott Dixon insisted mistakes are "never in the consumer's favour" with some items scanning at higher prices than those on the shelf. He warned shoppers that the "scandalous" problem of supermarkets overcharging at the tills is "getting worse". Scott, 52, of Edinburgh, added: "Prices have been rising so fast the staff cannot keep up with changing the tickets. Errors are becoming more common. "I'd recommend shoppers check receipts before they leave the store. The till was charging newer and higher prices but the items were priced on older and lower prices on the shelf. Tills must be centralised on changes." Scott said any food item can be affected by these pricing mistakes but more often than not it is the more popular items. He named Aldi and Morrisons among the culprits. Chicken, priced at £2.35 on the shelf at Aldi, went through at £2.59 at the till, he claimed, while 85p Piccalilli rang up at the checkout at £1.25. And chewing gum shot up from £2 on the shelf ticket to £2.40 at Morrisons store. He advised all customers to check their receipts for any incidence of incorrect pricing. Some supermarkets will compensate customers if they have been overcharged. Shoppers on social media have also voiced their anger at these out-of-date price offers in UK supermarkets. One customer posted on the MoneySavingExpert forum: "I was overcharged for bacon. I started paying more attention." Aldi said: "The prices displayed on the shelf for these products were incorrect and we apologise for any confusion. Errors like this are very rare." Morrisons said: "This was an isolated case last November during staff training. If an error occurs, we will aim to rectify it."
