Official data shows anxiety levels are up and feelings of happiness are down as middle-aged Britons now cope with rising bills. The only group to report lower life satisfaction than those aged 45 to 64 were those in their 90s. And those in their late 40s were more anxious than those about to retire. Retirement specialists Just Group analysed figures from the Office for National Statistics. Just Group's Stephen Lowe said: "People in the 45-64 age group often act as the glue that holds families together financially and emotionally. "The toll this can take on them can be overlooked but this research starts to paint a picture of how thinly stretched this group can feel. "And with inflation, interest rate rises and economic uncertainty, they will be feeling the strain even more over the coming months. "More recently we've seen many employers take positive steps to support workers' emotional wellbeing, but the impact of financial pressures is all too often forgotten." It is the 45-64 age group who are most likely to have dependent families both below and above them, with children going through school and university while their parents may need care.  Many will still be paying off mortgages while planning their retirement. Sarah Coles, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "The 'squeezed middle' is really feeling the pain as their income is pulled in all sorts of directions. "They're not just covering their children but, in many cases, also having to support older family members. "This may include helping to pay expensive care bills. "As bills rise through the roof, their budget is being stretched even thinner so it's no wonder that so many people are so anxious. "Anyone who took a break or worked part time for childcare reasons might be thinking of returning to work just at the time when their own parents start to need them more."
