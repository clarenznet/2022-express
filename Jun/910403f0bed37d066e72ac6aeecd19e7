Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, constantly dresses her sons Prince Louis and Prince George in outfits similar to those sported by her husband, Prince William as a young boy in the 80s. So it was no surprise to see Prince Louis arrive at the special occasion wearing the same white and navy sailor outfit, which a two-year-old Prince William wore 37 years ago at the same event.  Some royal watchers have suggested it could even be the same outfit, preserved from 1985. Prince Louis, 4, sat between his older siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte in a carriage, with their proud mother the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall sitting opposite. The children, who are dressed in a light blue, navy and white colour scheme, waved to the cheering crowds enthusiastically.  At one point Charlotte appeared to push her little brother Louis's hand down as he continued to wave and point at the crowds in The Mall. On his best behaviour, Prince Louis leaned out the window of Horse Guards and did a small salute at the Irish Guards as they continued to parade for the Trooping the Colour. Dressed in a cornflower blue dress, Charlotte squinted in the morning sunshine as the carriage left the palace. While future King Prince George looked smart in a navy suit and tie.
