Boris Johnson led the Tories to a landslide win in the 2019 general election, smashing expectations and gaining some of Labour’s grassroots constituencies. But the political landscape could not be more different now. This week, the Tories had one of its most comfortable majorities overturned in Devon and lost a key red wall seat in Wakefield. The disastrous results follow months of carnage for the ruling party. Partygate has put the Prime Minister squarely in the bad books of millions of Brits who stayed at home and followed coronavirus rules, even when he didn’t. Legislation such as deporting migrants to Rwanda has lost the Tories support, with even Prince Charles speaking out against Priti Patel’s flagship policy. The resignation of two MPs - one for watching pornographic images in parliament and the conviction of another for sexually assaulting a minor - have also eroded the trust of Tory voters and beyond. So, what do you think the Conservatives should do to get you back on side? Is it time for Boris Johnson to step aside, or do you still trust him to lead the Tories into the next general election?
