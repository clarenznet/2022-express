Ray Winstone looks almost unrecognisable in a snap he shared on Instagram of himself enjoying a holiday in sunny Portugal. The actor, 65, looked worlds away from his clean-shaven image as he soaked up the Mediterranean sun while joking that an egg could be fried on his stomach due to the high temperatures.  In view of his 122,000 followers, the TV star shared a candid snap as he topped up his tan. In the snap, Ray kicked back and relaxed as he lay on a sunlounger in Portugal. In the topless snap, Ray wore a shell necklace which he matched with a pair of orange-tinted sunglasses and a black hat. However, it was his bushy beard which rendered him almost unrecognisable. Ray told his fans: "Got two days off graft, so we’re hanging about “Vallado Winery” in the mountains of Portugal. “Hot, Too Hot! Not for me, I love it, you could fry an egg on my stomach” if you ever find yourselves down this way, stay here. "It’s the absolute business," he ended the post.
