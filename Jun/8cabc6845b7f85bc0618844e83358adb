Less than a week into the summer transfer window and some of the Premier League's biggest sides have already blockbuster deals, while others are working on statement signings of their own. The likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Leeds United remain hard at work, in the knowledge that getting business done early can often save cold, hard cash. Liverpool stole the show yesterday by announcing the arrival of Darwin Nunez for an initial Â£64million. If add-ons are triggered, he will become their record signing, and with Sadio Mane expected to make way over the coming weeks, the Uruguayan will be under pressure to produce instant results. Man Utd's window is yet to run so smoothly, with Barcelona still playing hardball over the services of Frenkie de Jong. The Dutchman remains a priority target for Erik ten Hag, but the Red Devils have also submitted a proposal for fellow midfielder Christian Eriksen, who is available on a free transfer. Leeds, meanwhile, have been mightily busy. Jesse Marsch has already welcomed two new faces, and while a deal has reportedly been agreed for a third, the Whites hierarchy are already getting to work on a fourth signature.
