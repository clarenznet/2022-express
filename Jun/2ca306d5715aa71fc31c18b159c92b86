In the end it was a little boy who beat both of them, and the Duchess of Cambridge shook his hand saying: "You did better than I did." Kate, 40, had swapped her stilettoes for a pair of wedges for the visit to Cambridgeshire County Day at Newmarket Racecourse. It was the final engagement of the day for the royal couple, who had travelled to Cambridge in the morning to see their first official portrait unveiled. Wills, who turned 40 this week, gasped: "It's quite big!" In the painting by British artist Jamie Coreth, Kate wears a Â£1,595 green gown by design brand The Vampire's Wife, which she was seen in during a visit to Ireland in 2020. She also wears the Queen's Cambridge Pearl Pendant brooch and a pearl bracelet and earrings that belonged to Princess Diana. The portrait will stay at Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum for three years before being shown around the UK. Afterwards, the duke and duchess visited East Anglia's Children's Hospices in Milton. Kate, - who was wearing a blue, patterned LK Bennett dress - enjoyed painting with eight-year-old Willow Bamber before the royals went to the housing charity Jimmy's in Cambridge and the County Day. Yesterday it was also revealed that a portrait of Princess Diana will go on display for the first time. The 1994 sketch by the late US artist Nelson Shanks shows her in the green Catherine Walker halter dress she wore for Vanity Fair magazine's June 1997 issue, two months before her death.
