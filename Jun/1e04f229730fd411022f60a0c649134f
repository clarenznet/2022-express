Brexit Party Member and former MEP Ben Habib said the EU has "shot itself in the foot" with the move and the British public will turn against them.Mr Habib said: "The EU is merely damaging itself by behaving in this way. I am delighted that they are revealing their true colours, because the British people will rise up against them". It emboldens the Government, to say well ok if you are going to be bloody-minded about this then we will become bloody-minded and be firmer in our stance. To hell with negotiations".
