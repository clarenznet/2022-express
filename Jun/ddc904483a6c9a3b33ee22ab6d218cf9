Nick Knowles, 59, looked loved-up as he attended Royal Ascot 2022 alongside girlfriend Katie Dadzie, 32. The DIY SOS host opted for a classic look in a bowler hat and three piece suit.  The star wore a black blazer and pinstripe trousers, matched with a black top hat for the occasion.  Meanwhile, his new girlfriend Katie looked beautifully summer-ready, as she dressed in a light, floral dress with matching feather hat and beige heels.  The two were pictured smiling together ahead of the races.  Nick and Katie went public with their romance for the first time earlier this year.
