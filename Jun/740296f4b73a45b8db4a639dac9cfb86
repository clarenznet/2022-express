Sharon Osbourne has taken time off from her new UK TV show The Talk to be with her husband in California. She says that the treatment is "a very major operation." Sharon added: "I have to be there. It's really going to determine the rest of his life." The Black Sabbath singer not only tumbled in his bathroom but also has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Before his fall in Los Angeles home, Ozzy also damaged his neck in a quad bike accident in 2003. With Ozzy struggling with his health over the past two years, Sharon admitted she does not know if he will be well enough to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary next month. Ozzy recently made a statement saying: "I am hoping this next surgery will get my balance back because I am falling all over the place. I feel 95. I am still in this recovery mode. I've just got to get going again.” "Everyone says 'Ozzy give it time' but how much f****** time have I got to give it?"    The operation took place in LA to correct issues with his initial surgery, which replaced rods in his back and neck. After that winter surgery, he said: "I have physical therapy every morning, three days a week. I am trying the best I can but my stamina has gone. I cannot sit around with a thumb up my a*** anymore." In March, Ozzy announced he wants to move from LA back to the UK in 2022 after 20 years. The rock legend wants to move back to his home in the village of Jordans, Bucks, prompted he said by high tax rates in LA.
