Max Verstappen leads the world championship by 46 points from team-mate Sergio Perez with Charles Leclerc a further three points back. The Dutchman's commanding championship lead is down to securing six wins from nine races, seven of which he has finished. Verstappen's excellent consistency should give him an excellent chance to rid the demons of 12 months ago when he retired from the British Grand Prix after a spectacular crash. However, the reigning champion could be under more pressure this weekend after his girlfriendâ€™s father, Nelson Piquet, racially abused Lewis Hamilton. The former F1 champion used a racial slur when describing the accident between the pair back in July last year. Despite this, Mercedes will arrive at Silverstone with optimism as the team brings new upgrades to the car. The changes and smooth track surface are expected to push Hamilton and George Russell closer to the front.
