Carol Vorderman stunned as she took to Instagram while wearing a plunging bikini top while gushing over the stunning landscape as she enjoyed a day of sunbathing yesterday. The star, 61, appeared happy and relaxed as she shared the short clip with her 226,000 followers who were left in awe at her natural beauty.  Wearing a plunging, black and white bikini top, Carol thoughtfully shared her stunning surroundings with fans while excitedly revealing that she was near an RAF base.  Carol exuded a natural glow in the skimpy swimwear, straw hat and large sunglasses, while opting to go makeup free as she flaunted her ageless beauty to fans.  Sharing her thoughts, Carol captioned the clip: "Happiest geek girl on the planet. In my dream home on the jetty next to the Crystal clear water, not a soul around, EXCEPT the stunning Hawk T2 @royalairforceuk doing their THANG from @royalairforcevalley.  "It's where our single seat fighter pilots are trained. I love watching the 3 ship (3 aircraft taking off at once together on the runway) at about 8.30am when I'm having my coffee."
