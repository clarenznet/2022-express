Kate Beckinsale, 48, stunned as she posed on her sofa at home for her many Instagram followers. The English actress looked amazing as she rested on her side in a mini black bandeau top, exposing her taut abs. She partnered the skimpy top with a skintight black skirt, featuring a bold graphic print of the late EastEnders legend June Brown, who played soap icon Dot Cotton, smoking a cigarette. Kate wore her signature brunette tresses in delicate waves as she posed for the camera. She captioned the sultry post with the word "OiOi", in view of her 5.4 million followers. Make-up artist Katrina Klein commented: "You're the best! Wait, I just realised that Dot Cotton is on your skirt. hahahahahahaa." (sic)
