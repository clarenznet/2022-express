Andy Murray was blunt when expressing his feelings following his second-round loss to John Isner at Wimbledon. When quizzed on how he felt, the Brit responded: "Yeah, pretty disappointed."  Murray was later asked to expand with a comparison to his 2021 US Open first-round defeat against Stefanos Tsitsipas, which went the distance. "I was pretty angry after the US Open last year," he explained. "I was pretty angry after that match. Probably more so than I am just now. "I feel disappointed right now. Obviously I wanted to do well here. I love playing at Wimbledon, a surface that I feel like I can still compete with the best guys on. It definitely, definitely hurts. But, yeah, US Open last year was certainly on a par with this if not worse." Murray's run at Wimbledon came to an end partly because he was unseeded, meaning he faced 20th seed Isner in the second round. The 35-year-old hopes to climb the world rankings over the coming months to avoid a similar situation occurring at the US Open. "I really want to try and improve my ranking to a level where I'm getting seeded in slams," he said. "That was a goal of mine sort of post-Miami. "I've spoken to my team a lot about that, and that's something that I want to try and put my position -- put myself in a position hopefully come the US Open. If not the US Open, then going into the Australian Open next year where I'm seeded again. "That means obviously I'll need to be out there competing and winning matches because it does make, like I said, things trickier.   "I was coming into Wimbledon feeling like I could have a deep run. If you're playing against top guys right at the beginning of the event, obviously makes it a little bit more challenging. "That's kind of what my goals are between now and the US Open."
