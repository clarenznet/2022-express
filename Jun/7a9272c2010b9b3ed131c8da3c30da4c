Rose Ayling-Ellis, 27, has raised fashion stakes on day three of Wimbledon 2022. She has done so with the help of Sinead McKeefry, the celebrity stylist behind the wardrobes of women such as Claudia Winkleman and Fearne Cotton.  The Strictly 2021 winner opted for a mini dress for this yearâ€™s star-studded annual tennis tournament.  She paired the high-neck style with a double breasted white jacket and heels for her royal box visit on day three of Wimbledon 2022.  Rose completed the look with a simple white clutch purse.  Day three of Wimbledon today sees Novak Djokovic, Emma Raducanu and Andy Murray scheduled to play on Centre Court.
