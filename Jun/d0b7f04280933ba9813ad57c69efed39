The royal chose the summery accessory for almost all the appearances during the royal tour of St Lucia last month. The Capri Bag in beige blue by Sophie Habsburg currently retails for £154.  For today's event, Sophie finished her look with a pair of white espadrilles with white ribbons to tie around her ankles.

She styled her hair into a low bun and opted for a natural make-up look. This morning, the Countess of Wessex stunned in a white dress with a pink and orange polka dot print. The Suzannah 'Cora' silk tea dress has a price tag of £1,050. Sophie's dress had a V-neck and three-quarter length sleeves bunched up in frills at the elbows. She combined the gown with nude stiletto heel shoes. For accessories, the Countess could be seen carrying a brown tweed clutch bag.
