Jamie Lee Curtis looked stunning in a series of pictures she shared on Instagram from when she was 20 years old. The Hollywood icon, 63, stunned in the pictures with a short wavy bob, which were taken at her apartment in Los Angeles in 1978. The star told her 4.2 million fans: "A klute, pun intended #tbt to when I thought I could play pool/snooker and thought I could rock the Jane Fonda KLUTE haircut and pull off the linen does wrinkle outfit. "Remember there were no stylists or glam teams back then. Funny to see it. "I think this was from the movie ROAD GAMES that I made with Richard Franklin in Australia with Stacy Keach."
