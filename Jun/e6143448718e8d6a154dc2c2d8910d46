André (André Dussollier), a retired industrialist from Paris, is paralysed after a stroke. With no hope of a full recovery, he asks novelist daughter Manue (Sophie Marceau) to arrange his assisted suicide.  Flashbacks detail their troubled relationship but he's a lot closer to Manue than his other daughter, gallery worker Pascale (Géraldine Pailhas), and his ex-wife Claude (Charlotte Rampling), a famous sculptress with chronic depression. In the grand tradition of French cinema, every character is a wealthy intellectual. Still, there's plenty of grit in the unsentimental script which uses the issue of assisted suicide as the springboard for a convincing family drama.
