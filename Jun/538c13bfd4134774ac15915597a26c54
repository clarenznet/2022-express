West Midlands Police ordered everyone to leave Stoke Heath Park in north Coventry, at around 2.45pm and cordoned it off for several hours. The shell, discovered in a nearby canal, was buried under sandbags in a hole dug by specially trained officers. Abdulwahid Hassan, 22 and who saw the explosion, said it was "quite loud" despite being buried a significant way underground. Speaking to Coventry Live, the university student said: "It was my first time being around something like this, so it was a really cool experience. The bomb was quite loud even after being buried fairly deep in the ground." Footage captures the bomb disposal unit carrying out the operation, which took several hours. A spokesman for the police said: "We were called after a suspected World War Two shell was found in the canal off Leicester Causeway, Coventry, just after 2.45pm yesterday (14 June). "We contacted the EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) who removed the device and carried out a controlled explosion." Stoke Heath Park is a large green space near the Court House Green area of the city. Residents took to Facebook to praise the police and bomb squad for their work. One woman posted: "Well done those highly trained EOD officers who risked their lives... If they'd not packed it with sandbags etc, it would have been much bigger. Effectively it was underground to lessen potential damage." Another Facebook user shared: "Gosh, this is what we heard on Tuesday. It was loud."
