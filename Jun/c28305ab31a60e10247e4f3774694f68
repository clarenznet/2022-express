The four-day bank holiday weekend was celebrated by millions with events including Trooping the Colour, a thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral, a concert at Buckingham Palace and a pageant through London. The Royal Family even made two balcony appearances and attended events in all countries of the United Kingdom. Celebrations began with Trooping the Colour on Thursday, June 2, followed by working members of the Royal Family watching the Red Arrows and RAF flypast from the Buckingham Palace balcony. In the evening more than 3,500 beacons were lit across the UK and Commonwealth. The 96-year-old monarch did not attend a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday, June 3. She also cancelled her appearance at the Epsom Derby on Saturday, June 4, due to her episodic mobility issues. Buckingham Palace hosted The Platinum Party at the Palace with 22,000 fans attending the concert. Celebrations ended with thousands lining the pavements of London on Sunday, June 5, to watch the Jubilee pageant. Over the weekend some 10 million Britons hosted street parties with the country coming together to celebrate Her Majesty in their local communities. For those at home, BBC One showed 15 and a half hours of live coverage over the four days, in addition to documentaries and special programming. The Queen said she was “humbled and deeply touched” by the celebrations held across the UK. In a statement at the end of the weekend’s celebrations, the Queen said she had been inspired by the kindness, joy and kinship shown. She acknowledged that she was unable to attend all official events but said she was “committed to serving you to the best of my ability supported by my family”. So what do YOU think?
