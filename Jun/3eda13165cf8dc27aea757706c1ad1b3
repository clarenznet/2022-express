The Foreign Secretary was addressing MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee where she warned that foreign policy needs to be about spreading British interests and supporting liberty against China. But asked about suggestions from Macron that the UK would be linking up again with the EU on foreign affairs less than two years after Brexit she responded: "Not true!" Howeverm, Ms warned the biggest economies, not just in Europe, need to do more after they held their meeting last week in Germany. She said: "I want the G7 to act as an economic Nato not just the challenge of Russia but also the challenge of China." She went on: "What we need is a network of liberty around the world with both Nato and the G7." Ms Truss insisted that she "envisaged no problems" with France in taking on Russia and China despite President Macron suggesting a compromise with Vladimir Putin recently. And the Foreign Secretary revealed that she will be meeting her French counterpart next week for talks on Ukraine and Britain's overall relationship with its nearest neighbour.  Ms Truss also rubbished claims that the UK has bad relations with members of the EU. She revealed that 13 formal bilateral agreements are already in place with EU states, most recently Portugal. Another seven are "in the pipeline" and will be signed shortly, she added. Her comments underlined that UK relations with countries in the eU are not dependent on Brussels. The evidence to one of the most powerful committees in Parliament comes after Ms Truss managed to secure the Second Reading of the Northern Ireland Bill to fix the controversial Protocol and thwart EU attempts to break up the UK.
