Sir Cliff Richard, 81, is known for his boyish good looks that appear to have lasted the test of time as he put on a suave appearance at Wimbledon today. The legendary singer wore a metallic grey blazer while putting his best fashion foot forward at the tennis tournament this afternoon. Cliff paired the jazzy blazer with a striped tie, black shirt, trousers, and leather shoes. On Twitter, fans gushed over the star as they praised his youthful visage. @mackemandy81 typed: “Cliff Richard just doesn’t age. Back at Wimbledon again I see.” @Richard96543187 remarked: “Rain on the first day of Wimbledon, bring out Cliff Richard! "We're all going on a summer holiday. "
