Phyllis Middlemass, 60, says she spent a week in hospital and was in a sling for three months after she claims she was struck by a pallet lifter. She claims it was being pulled by a worker at the Aldi in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, in October 2019. According to the Daily Record, Phyllis is now on the lookout for a lawyer to help her. She says she was left with a broken arm, a head injury and a fractured wrist. She also claims that skin was ripped off her left shin. She said: “I’m left with these injuries through no fault of my own. It wasn’t my fault, I was just out doing my shopping.” When asked for a comment about the incident in-store, an Aldi spokesperson said: “We are not in a ­position to comment as it is an ongoing legal matter.” Aldi is the UK’s 5th largest supermarket chain and has 950 stores. According to its website: "Without our customers, we wuldn't get very far. Which is why we put them at the heart of everything we do. From tackling campylobacter to through to a range of customer-focused initiatives, we're giving back to the people who support us most."   Aldi is also officially the nation’s favourite supermarket, according to the latest polling data from YouGov. Shoppers rated the UK’s lowest-priced supermarket ahead of M&S, Tesco and Sainsbury’s in the study.  It comes at the same time as the supermarket attracted an additional 1.6m shoppers as consumers look to save money amid rising energy, mortgage and tax bills. Richard Thornton, communications director at Aldi, said: “With so many costs rising right now, customers want to know they can still afford to treat themselves to high-quality food and drink without breaking the bank. “Aldi is the only supermarket to offer that unbeatable combination of great quality products at low prices. We believe that’s why British shoppers have, once again, voted us the nation’s favourite.”
