The scrapping of the Plug-in Car Grant, for drivers buying an electric car under Â£32,000, was criticised by motoring groups. And it came as average petrol prices reached a new high of 185.4p a litre on Monday, up 6.9p in a week, according to data firm Experian.  Transport minister Trudy Harrison said they wanted to use the grant cash for other vehicles, "from taxis to vans...to help make the switch to zero emission travel cheaper and easier". But AA chief Edmund King said: "Drivers, and indeed many fleets, planning to make the switch to EV, may now back out until they can find more cash." RAC's Nicholas Lyes said it was disappointed. Consultancy New AutoMotive found high pump prices meant the cost of running an EV was around 80 percent lower than for petrol and diesel.
