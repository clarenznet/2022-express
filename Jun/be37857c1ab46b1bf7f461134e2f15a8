Max Verstappen will take a commanding lead into the weekend with a 46-point advantage over team-mate Sergio Perez Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc lies 49 points behind Verstappen after the Monegasque’s strong start crumbled away. Leclerc has now retired from two of the last four races as mechanical failures plagued him in Spain and Azerbaijan. The Ferrari star also suffered from bad luck in the other two to drop behind his main title rival. A bad strategy call in Monaco cost him a great chance of victory, while a grid penalty for taking new engine parts ended his chances in Canada before the race had begun. Silverstone provides new optimism for the British pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The Mercedes stars have been promised new upgrades for their home race in a bid to close the gap on the leaders. An excellent third and fourth in Canada was their joint-best result of the season so far with Russell maintaining his record of top-five finishes in 2022.
