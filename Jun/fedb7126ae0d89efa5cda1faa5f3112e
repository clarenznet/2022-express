Max Verstappen is seeking a first ever Azerbaijan Grand Prix race win this weekend - but he will only start in third for Sunday's race after qualifying on Saturday. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc produced a stunning pole lap for his fourth successive pole position, though he has not won any of the last three races having lost his lead in the Drivers' Championship. Sergio Perez starts between Verstappen and Leclerc in second. Leclerc declared post-qualifying he did not expect to start on top spot but the Monegasque went nearly half-a-second faster than team-mate Carlos Sainz who had been on provisional pole. Sainz, in second, was 0.282seconds slower than Leclerc. Sainz will only start fourth despite having gone into his final flying lap off the back of the quickest lap. George Russell, seeking to continue his faultless run of top-five finishes, starts P5 but Lewis Hamilton is only seventh. The Mercedes driver faces an investigation from the stewards for driving unnecessarily slowly in front of the McLarens. Pierre Gasly is between the two Mercedes in one AlphaTauri with Yuki Tsunoda eighth in the other. Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel is ninth while Fernando Alonso starts 10th for Alpine. The two McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo are 11th and 12th having narrowly missed out on the top-10 Q3 shootout. Relive qualifying for the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix below.
