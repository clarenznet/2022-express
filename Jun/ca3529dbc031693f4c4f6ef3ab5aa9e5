In his resignation letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chris Pincher admitted he had "embarrassed" hiimself and "other people" after drinking too much. In the letter, he wrote: "Last night I drank far too much. I've embarrassed myself and other people which is the last thing I want to do and for that I apologise to you and those concerned."   The letter continued: "I think the right thing to do in the circumstances is for me to resign as Deputy Chief Whip. "I owe it to you and the people I've caused upset to, to do this. "I want to assure you that you will continue to have my full support from the back benches, and I wish you all the best as you deal with aftershocks of Covid and the challenges of international inflation. "It has been the honour of my life to have served in Her Majesty's Government."    It is understood Mr Pincher will remain a Tory MP because he has admitted wrongdoing and resigned from his whip's role. Mr Pincher has been the MP for Tamworth since 2010 and served as a minister under former PM Theresa May. The news comes after former Tory MP Neil Parish  resigned after admitting he twice viewed pornography on his phone in the House of Commons in what he described as "a moment of madness". Mr Pincher was reportedly drinking at Tory Party private members club the Carlton Club in Piccadilly when he is alleged to have groped two fellow guests. A number of alarmed Tory MPs contacted the Tory whips office to complain about his behaviour and demand he lose his role.   More to follow...
