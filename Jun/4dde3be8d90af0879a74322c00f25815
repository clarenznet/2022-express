Heidi Klum, who is still in the modelling game aged 49, stepped out to enjoy the sunshine while wearing a long, black, transparent lace skirt. She paired it with a ruffled black top and a chic pair of sunglasses, and tagged high fashion designer Marc Jacobs when rocking the look on Instagram for her 9.6 million followers. The America's Got Talent judge was keen to show the world her fashion forward outfit while making the most of the sultry summer weather. This isn't the first time this week the star has excelled with impressive outfits, previously modelling clashing leopard prints on an outing with husband Tom Kaulitz, 32. Heidi also paraded a glittering multicoloured rainbow dress for her appearance in New York City on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday.
