Ukrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina will be absent from Wimbledon this week despite the tournament banning Russian and Belarusian players from competing. In April, The All England Tennis Club sparked controversy by issuing a strongly worded statement confirming they were imposing sanctions amid the invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. The decision was roundly criticised by players, with Novak Djokovic last week reaffirming his stance that the ruling is wrong. In response, the ATP, WTA, and ITF stripped the tournament at SW19 of ranking points, potentially undermining the prestige of the iconic grass-court event. On Monday, Wimbledon CEO Sally Bolton issued her regret on the impact the All England Club’s decision had caused, which has rendered the likes of men's world No 1 Daniil Medvedev absent. However, she also stood by the ban, which was issued after discussions with the UK Government. However, the santions haven't persuaded Svitolina, 27, to take her place in the main draw. The former world No 3, a semi-finalist at SW19 in 2019, is on an indefinite break from tennis to focus her efforts on raising funds and awareness of her country's plight.
