Dyson first introduced its laser-guided V15 vacuums back in 2021 but now the famous cleaning firm is back with a new compact device that should rid homes of every speck of dust. The all-new V12 Detect features a slimline design that makes it easier to whizz around the floors plus it features the unique laser head which reveals exactly where dust and grime is hiding around the home. This works by shooting out a green light with muck that can't be seen by the naked eye suddenly becoming visible. Despite its lightweight look, Dyson is promising that users will get plenty of suction with the firm boasting that this is their most powerful compact cordless vacuum yet. It also features new Acoustic Dust Sensing technology which monitors what is being sucked up and sets the power accordingly. That means better battery life and cleaner carpets as you always get enough power for the job at hand. There's even an LCD screen that shows the size and number of particles being picked up in real-time so you can see just how disgusting your floors really are. Another nice addition on the V12 is the latest anti-tangle hair screw head which makes sure hair spins off into the collection bin rather than getting twisted around the brushes. Speaking about the new V12 Detect, James Dyson said: "As engineers our job is to solve daily problems, and recent times have created plenty of new ones with more time spent indoors. "We are all cleaning more frequently, trying to remove the additional house dust but desperate for peace of mind that our homes are truly clean." If that news has got you thinking that it's time for a spring clean then be warned. The V12 Detect is not exactly cheap. Those wanting to own one will need to fork out Â£529.99 - ouch! Not bothered by that high price? It's available now.
