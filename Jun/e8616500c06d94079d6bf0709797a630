The Duke of Sussex attended the service along with other royals as he joined his family in the UK for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Harry and Meghan were greeted with a mix of cheers and boos from crowds as they arrived at the cathedral. Harry was spotted, with his mouth wide open, appearing to be enjoying a hilarious joke with another royal seated across the aisle. Beatrice, sitting a few seats down, was also grinning in the same direction. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were holding hands as they walked into the Cathedral, smiling and waving at the crowds. They had to squeeze past Harry's cousins, Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, who were already seated, to get to their places. The Sussexes attended the Trooping celebrations at Horse Guards on Thursday, but stayed out of the spotlight inside the Duke of Wellington's former office with more than 30 members of the family. Today is their first public appearance in the UK since they left in 2020. The couple moved to the United States to lead a more independent life, and have since delivered some stinging attacks on Buckingham Palace and the royal family. The service at St Paul's Cathedral is to pay tribute to the sovereign's 70 years on the throne. It is taking place on the second day of the celebrations for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.  The monarch herself didn't attend the service, as it was announced yesterday that she experienced some discomfort following her appearance on the balcony of the Buckingham Palace as she greeted the crowds during the Trooping the Colour parade. The 96-year-old has been forced to cancel a series of engagements recently because of "episodic mobility problems". Nearly 40 senior royals and politicians attended the ceremony in honour of the Queen. Also absent from the service was Prince Andrew, 62, who has tested positive for COVID-19.
