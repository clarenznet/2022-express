The fist fight, which erupted in front of startled customers at the Birmingham Markets, was filmed by one of the bystanders. Their footage shows the two young men skirting around each other in circles near to the Bullring shopping centre before trading punches, reports Birmingham Live. At one point one manages to grab the other person - and knock his cap off. The astonishing broad daylight fight took place as frightened shoppers watched on. One bystander in a white top is seen urging them to "leave it man, leave it" before he calmly intervenes and separates the pair. A female voice can also be heard saying "stop fighting" as the brawl continues. However, another man urges the fighters to "keep going". The shocking scenes happened next to a row of empty stalls at around 2pm on Wednesday (June 22). Thankfully, it appears that neither person involved in the incident was seriously injured.  People flooded to Birmingham Live's Facebook page to comment on the footage, with many users glad to see that there were no weapons involved in the fight. This comes in wake of the increase in knife crime across the United Kingdom. One person said: "Doing it old school. Fair play, no weapons". A second person added: "At least they are fighting with their fists, rather than silly little boys with knives". "No knives or a seven on one situation... good," someone said. Another commented: "Fist fight is pushing it... Could apply for Strictly..." A fifth person wrote: "Fair play to the guy who intervened and stopped it". Why the fight began is still a mystery, but the West Midlands Police has been contacted for a comment on the incident.
