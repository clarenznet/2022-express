Following his death on May 26, the band said there had been an “outpouring of love.” On Instagram Depeche Mode said: “A couple of weeks ago we got the result from the medical examiners, which Andy’s family asked us to share with you now. “Andy suffered an aortic dissection at home. So, even though it was far, far too soon, he passed naturally and without prolonged suffering.”  The band held a celebration of his life in London last week, describing it as a beautiful ceremony with tears and laughs. The statement was signed by bandmates Martin Gore and Dave Gahan, the singer. Andy leaves behind wife Grainne and children Megan and Joe.
