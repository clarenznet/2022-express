Dame Joan Collins, 89, looked sensational and merely a fraction of her age as she posed alongside 56-year-old Liz Hurley in a throwback snap celebrating the latter's birthday. In view of her 277,000 followers, Joan exclaimed in the caption: "Happy Birthday E!" In a tribute to her friend, whose full name is Elizabeth. Affectionately referring to Liz as her daughter, a role which she also takes on in E! series The Royals, Joan exclaimed: "We miss you! Love, Mummy Dearest." In the snap, which also featured Liz's 19-year-old son Damian, Joan stood out in the centre of the image, while dazzling in a crystal and sequin encrusted silver dress. Her choice of outfit was a great fit for her usual impeccably glamorous demeanour.
