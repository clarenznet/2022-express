Her oldest son and heir, Prince Charles is expected to attend the opening ceremony in her place. The 2022 Commonwealth Games, is an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth. It is scheduled to be held in Birmingham from July 28 to August 8 2022. And this year will be the third time England's hosted the Commonwealth Games following London in 1934 and Manchester in 2002. The Queen is patron of the Commonwealth Games Federation, the organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games. The opening ceremony will take place on July 28 at the city's Alexander Stadium, in front of an audience of 35,000 people. Birmingham 2022 is set to be the largest multi-sport event to be held in England in the last decade. A spectacular closing ceremony is scheduled for August 8. Sources told the Mail that the engagement is "still in the Queenâ€™s diary and that no final decision had been taken, adding: "Decisions on events are taken closer to the time." Although a specific reason for Queen's absence was not given, it is understood that it is due to the monarch experiencing sporadic mobility difficulties and wants to pace herself. The Queen made a limited number of appearances during the four-day Platinum Jubilee celebrations.  She had to cancel her attendance at the National Thanksgiving Service at St Paul's Cathedral on Saturday, June 4. Also, she could not make it to her beloved Epsom Derby. However, she did wave at the cheering crowds during two appearances at the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside other senior members of the royal family. Previously, she has had to cancel her attendance at the State Opening of Parliament, with Prince Charles taking her place.
