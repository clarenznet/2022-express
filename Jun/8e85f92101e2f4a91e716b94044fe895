Paris Jackson, 24, turned heads last night as she attended the 75th Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Pop legend Michael Jackson’s daughter opted for an off-shoulder nude flowy gown that featured chain patterned embroidery. She was accompanied by her brother Prince, 25, who looked dapper in a suit paired with black shoes, and a shirt and tie. The siblings stunned fans of the late King of Pop with their grown-up transformation, as the duo posed up a storm on the red carpet before paying tribute to their father on stage during the ceremony.
