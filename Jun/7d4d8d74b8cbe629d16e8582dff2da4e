Donna D'Errico, 54, showed off her amazingly ageless figure last night as she attended an event during the 75th annual Cannes film festival. The Baywatch star made a fabulous appearance at the Frank & Penelope launch party in a low cut floor-length purple gown. Donna had also traded her signature blonde hair for brunette locks, which she styled in her usual side part. The actress completed the show-stopping look with drop earrings and a fur shawl.
