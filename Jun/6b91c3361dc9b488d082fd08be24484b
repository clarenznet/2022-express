Johnny Depp, 59, is set to play King Louis XV in his first film role since winning his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. Amid his positive career trajectory, the actor was spotted continuing his post-trial transformation, while wearing a suede jacket and debuting a new braided hairstyle.  The Hollywood star, who recently stunned fans with his clean-shaven visage, was spotted in Paris as he headed to the airport carrying a mocha-coloured briefcase as he waved to fans before being ushered into a chauffeur driven car. He was wearing dark aviator glasses and had a brown scarf wrapped around the handle of his briefcase. Johnny’s last appearance in a movie was Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge, which was released in 2017. A source has since told Poptopic that the actor has been in talks with Disney since his legal victory, and that a possible return to the franchise as Captain Jack Sparrow was on the cards to the tune of $300 million, as reported by the Daily Mail.
