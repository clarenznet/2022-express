New research has shown that the London borough of Westminster is the most expensive place in the country for motorists to drive in. According to the latest figures, drivers will have to pay £8,722 per year to drive there. This in turn is £3,000 more than Liverpool occupying the second place. Rivervale Leasing’s study looked at the average cost of insurance, fuel, parking, tolls, repairs, servicing and road tax. They analysed 50 of the most populous areas of the UK and found that the City of Westminster was by far the most expensive area to drive. British drivers spend a huge £3,800 per year on average, but people spend more than twice that in Westminster– and that’s without buying the car itself.
