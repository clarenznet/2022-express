The three-part drama Nolly, written by Dr Who supremo Russell T Davies, will explore the all-powerful reign and decline of Crossroads actress Noele Gordon. She was declared the Queen of the Midlands thanks to her iconic role as Meg Mortimer and was the darling of the establishment. But after 18 years in the show and at the height of the soap's success, she was axed without warning or explanation, with Crossroads ending two years later. Helena, 56, was spotted in an auburn wig and fur coat filming scenes with an unidentified co-star in the streets of Bolton. It has been transformed into 1970s Birmingham for the ITV three-parter. Helena said: "Noele was a fascinating, complex, brilliant and gutsy woman - none of which I knew before I read Russell T Davies' script. I'm so thrilled to help tell Nolly's long overdue and largely forgotten story." Noele played Meg from 1964 to 1981, and later returned for a two-episode stint in 1983. She died in 1985 at the age of 66.
