Ezekiel Long stepped on scorching hot sand while playing at the beach on Saturday, June 11. The four-year-old was taken to the hospital by his mother, Kerensa Long, where he was treated for burns. Kerensa shared a photo of her son's injury in a bid to remind people of the dangers of leaving beach fires unattended. She wants people to do the responsible thing and dampen the fire with seawater or mark the dangerous area with stones, reports Cornwall Live. Kerensa said there was no evidence that there had been a fire on the patch of sand where Ezekiel burned his foot at Grebe Beach near Falmouth, Cornwall. She said: "As it's that time of year, I just want to send a message to people to clear up and make sure it's safe before they leave. "Take the barbecue home or wash it in the water first. It's irresponsible and it can have a big impact." Ezekiel was taken to the hospital where he was seen immediately for his wound. He returned to the hospital for further treatment on his foot the following day. Speaking on the day of the incident (June 11), Kerensa said: "The bottom of his foot is completely blistered and tomorrow they have to cut all the skin off. "He's all bandaged up and on ibuprofen and paracetamol but he can't put a shoe on and probably won't be able to go to playschool on Monday."  Kerensa said she felt that it was extremely important to highlight the dangers of beach fires as had it been an even younger child crawling on the beach, they may be unable to lift themselves from the burning sand.
