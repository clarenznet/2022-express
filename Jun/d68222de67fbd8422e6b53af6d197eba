Lewis Hamilton could be banned from this weekend's British Grand Prix as his exemption from the FIA's jewellery ban comes to an end. It means the seven-time champion could be hit with severe penalties if he tries to compete with any jewellery on during tomorrow’s free practice sessions. It’s a big weekend for Mercedes who have claimed they are optimistic of being able to compete closer to the front. The team are bringing a set of new upgrades to the car for the British Grand Prix as Hamilton and George Russell aim for glory on home turf. The Mercedes has looked more competitive at traditional purpose-built trace tracks with smoother surfaces compared to the many bumpy street tracks seen so far. However, Red Bull have so far dominated proceedings in 2022 with Max Verstappen enjoying a commanding lead at the top of the standings. The Dutchman is now almost 50 points ahead of his early season rival Charles Leclerc after Ferrari mechanical failures and strategy mistakes have cost the Monegasque.
