Matthew was cast as Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell's) son David Metcalfe four years later in 2006.      The pair began dating in 2007 and announced they were expecting their first child in 2009. Matthew went on to propose to Charley on Christmas day of that same year, and the couple welcomed their eldest son Buster in April 2010.
