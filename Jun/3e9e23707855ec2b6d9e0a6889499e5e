Tom Cruise's ex-wife Katie Holmes looked smitten with her boyfriend Bobby Wooten III as they attended the Tribeca FilmÂ Festival together. The couple couldn't keep their hands off each other as they posed professionally for snaps on the red carpet. Katie stunned in a white, peek-a-boo dress which featured a netted design, allowing for glimpses of her skin beneath the floor-length design. She wore her brown tresses in loose waves around her shoulders and accessorised with a thick, gold choker and nude-coloured clutch. Her boyfriend, Bobby, cut a smart casual figure in a collarless white shirt, black jacket and trousers.
