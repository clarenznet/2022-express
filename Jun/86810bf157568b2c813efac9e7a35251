The data was published by the TaxPayers’ Alliance, with investigations campaign manager Elliot Keck claiming its findings highlighted “horrendously wasteful excesses” in arms-length organisations. However, NHS Blood and Transplant Service has countered by pointing out the important role social media plays in enabling it to connect with potential new donors, as well as encouraging existing ones to attend blood donor sessions. In order to compile its results, the TPA submitted a series of Freedom of Information requests to establish levels of social media spending by quangos (a term which stands for quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations). Total overall spend was £31,248,548, with spending more than doubling during the first year of the pandemic, and 50 per cent above pre-pandemic levels during the second year. NHS England spent £4,634,736.69, the NHS Blood and Transplant Service £3,179,580.67, and VisitScotland £2,611,273.46, including £80,000 on WeChat, the Chinese instant messaging service. Six other organisations spent in excess of £1 million - VisitBritain (£2,577,307.88), the Office for National Statistics (£2,288,092), Scottish Enterprise/Scottish Development International (£2,000,964), Sport England (£1,495,402.68), the British Council (£1,482,219.35) and the Financial Conduct Authority (£1,083,910). Mr Keck said: "Taxpayers will wonder why quangos are spending vast sums on social media platforms they've never heard of. Far too many arms length bodies are riddled with horrendously wasteful excesses and a serious lack of accountability. "Ministers must trim back the endlessly increasing size of government, starting by streamlining the quango state." An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesperson said: “We use social media channels to attract new donors and prompt existing donors to give blood. “The NHS needs 5,000 donations every day to save and improve the lives of patients in emergency surgery, childbirth and to treat debilitating conditions.

"Social media is one element of our overall marketing strategy designed to attract visitors to Scotland. In 2021/22 it accounted for just 16 percent of VisitScotland’s overall paid media spend. “We take a targeted approach to using social media and we get strong levels of engagement, focusing on those platforms which work best for our target demographic in each country. During the pandemic our marketing team has focused on using digital platforms and assets, including social media channels, to reach wider audiences.

"This allowed for a significant increase in spend across all VisitScotland’s marketing activity, including on social media, to target audiences in key inbound markets of North America, Europe, UK, and China.” A spokesperson for NHS England, said: “Communicating with the public through widely used social media platforms is a lifesaving way for the NHS to raise awareness of a wide range of important health issues, such as how to spot the signs of cancer or a heart attack. Campaign spending is approved by ministers in both the DHSC and the Cabinet Office.” Top 10 QUANGOs by social media spend: 1) NHS England: £4,634,736.69 2) NHS Blood and Transplant Service: £3,179,580.673) Visit Scotland: £2,611,273.46 4) Visit Britain: £2,577,307.88 5) ONS: £2,288,092 6) Scottish Enterprise/Scottish Development International: £2,000,964 7) Sport England: £1,495,402.68 8) British Council: £1,482,319.35 9) Financial Conduct Authority: £1,083,910 10) HMRC: £924,521.34 Comment by John O'Connell, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance: The TaxPayers’ Alliance have long called for a bonfire of the quangos – quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations. There are too many government bodies that taxpayers have never heard of; doing work they don’t care much about; and wasting taxpayers’ money doing it. Today we reveal that these bodies are spending tens of millions of pounds on communicating via social media. Certainly, there are legitimate reasons to spend money on social media. The almost £2.3 million spent by the Office for National Statistics seems excessive, but is understandable given 2021 was a census year - and all the promotional material that comes with it. Likewise, four NHS bodies spent a combined £8 million. Given the need for public health messaging around covid-19, this is not necessarily wasteful. But when one reflects on the fact that each NHS Trust will also have its own social media spend, you wonder if perhaps some of that money might have been better spent on nurses, doctors and equipment. But much of the spending is not justifiable, or is even downright daft. What possessed, for example, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, to spend £5,000 on “Reddit”? And what on earth is Visit Scotland doing spending over £2.6 million, including on platforms that support the Chinese censorship state? That’s more than Visit Britain, which already promotes Scotland enthusiastically. This is the sort of wasteful spending that taxpayers really should not tolerate. Britain has a bloated bureaucracy, with too many bodies trying to do too much. It’s time for the government to restart the bonfire.
