Cliff Richard, 81, has appeared at Wimbledon in great spirits as the singer arrived at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. He showed up at the Tennis tournament for the second time this week.  The star looked smart dressed in a teal suit over a white shirt.  He complemented the ensemble with a tie and pocket square.  Cliff also pinned a red rose to his lapel.  The Devil Woman singer protected his eyes with some sunglasses as he enjoyed the tennis, despite the glum weather.
