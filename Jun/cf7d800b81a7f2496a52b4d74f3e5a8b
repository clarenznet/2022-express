Drivers in the UK are being hit with millions of pounds worth of fines from speed cameras every week, with West Yorkshire the worst affected. Speed cameras in that area are activated a staggering 850 times per day - more than a million over a three year period. Car Lease Special Offers sent Freedom of Information requests to police forces in the UK, to find out which speed cameras were catching drivers out the most. They also discovered which areas were causing the biggest amount of speed camera activations between January 2019 - March 2022. For context, if all West Yorkshire’s activations led to prosecutions at the minimum fine amount of £100 each, it could total an eye-watering amount of £10,058,3000. The next top area was those covered by The Met police, with 789,621 recorded camera offences - which is an average of 666 a day.

Since the start of 2019 until 31st March 2022, this has had 1,223 activations. That equates to just 1.03 flashes per day. Will Bullen of Car Lease Special Offers said: ”While speeding continues to be the biggest offender when it comes to driving fines, it’s important to remember to stick to the speed limit and avoid dangerous driving that could cause harm to yourself and other road users. “Know the route you wish to travel on or research it before you go on a trip, and leave yourself plenty of time to arrive at your destination to avoid having to speed up and get caught by a camera.” The most common cameras in the UK are Gatso and Truvelo speed cameras, but there are more than a dozen different types of speed camera in use on UK roads in total. Speed camera detectors can use GPS location technology to warn drivers of fixed camera locations. In addition, some units also feature laser and radar detecting technology to warn of mobile speed camera sites, as well as those fixed locations that aren't logged on to the device's database.
