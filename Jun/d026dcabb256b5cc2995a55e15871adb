If you're trying and failing to access Yahoo! Mail this morning you are definitely not alone. The hugely popular messaging service appears to be having some major issues with hundreds of reports that its users can't read, reply, send or open new emails. However, one of the biggest problems appears to be users seeing their full inbox but then getting an error that reads "We couldn't load this message," when they try and check an individual email. The gremlins first appeared at around 9.30am with the frustrating problems still ongoing. In fact, Down Detector - which monitors outages across the globe - is actually showing a steady increase in reports with some 1,500 per minute being shown by its chart. Speaking on its forum page one Yahoo! user named Elaine said: "Can see my emails but cannot open them or delete them - haven't tried sending any yet." Whilst another named Julian added: "Unable to access Yahoo emails this morning." Along with the reports on Down Detector, Yahoo! users have also flocked to social media to vent their frustrations. Speaking on Twitter, one angry user named Sayan, said: "Is @yahoomail down? Trying to send emails for 2 hours.. no email showing under sent box.. every inbox items opening with alert "please try again later". Please fix this." Another, named Ritesh, tweeted: "Is there any problem or server down #Yahoomail since morning not able to access anything in yahoo mail." There's no word on what's causing the problems but Yahoo! has now confirmed that has spotted the glitch and is working on a fix. In a statement, Yahoo! said: "Some users may be experiencing issues with Yahoo Mail. We're aware of this issue and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible." We'll bring you more updates as they happen. MORE FOLLOWS
