He is being sued by Richard Millett over remarks made on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show in 2018 while still leader of the opposition. Mr Justice Nicklin considered pre-trial issues at a High Court hearing yesterday. The judge said he will not let October's trial turn into a "showpiece". When asked if he was an anti-Semite during the TV interview, Mr Corbyn referred to two people being "abusive" at a House of Commons meeting in 2013 as the Palestinian ambassador was speaking.  Mr Millett argues he was identifiable to viewers as one of those referred to.
