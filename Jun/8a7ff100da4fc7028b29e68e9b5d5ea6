Tess Daly, 53, and Vernon Kay, 48, are one of TV's most popular power couples, having first crossed paths at a Christmas party held by the BBC in 1999. The presenters have now been married 19 years with the pair tying the knot back in 2003. A series of pictures from that year show the lovebirds' chemistry ahead of their nuptials as they attended the GQ awards at The Royal Opera House. The loved-up couple could be seen in different snaps sharing a hug and laughing while they sat at their table at the glamorous event.
