Adris Mohammed showed no emotion yesterday as he was jailed for life for the "horrific" murder of David Varlow, 78. He must spend at least 33 years behind bars. Disabled Mr Varlow died of a stress-induced heart attack after knife-wielding serial thief Mohammed made him reveal his bank card PIN by "fear and force". Mohammed, 44, left the pensioner bound to a chair with phone flex to go on a £550 spending spree with the card on November 3 last year. He shared the PIN with others and £8,000 was plundered from the victim's account, Birmingham Crown Court was told. But a week later, Mohammed and another man returned to the house in Halesowen, West Midlands, untied Mr Varlow's body and stole a second bank card. Mohammed, of Ladywood, West Midlands, was found guilty of murder, burglary and fraud last month. Yesterday, Recorder of Birmingham Melbourne Inman QC said Mr Varlow's murder could "only properly be described as a horrific case". He told Mohammed: "Having seen you give evidence, it's clear you have not a shred of remorse. "You knew Mr Varlow would be at home and when you confronted him you set about a deliberate and calculated course of action in tying him in the way you did. "You intended to kill him by leaving him immobile without food or water." Mohammed killed Mr Varlow after failing to break into his home days earlier. His body was found after relatives alerted police. DNA from Mohammed was discovered on a knife, scissors and cable at the house. Injuries to Mr Varlow's wrists and ankles showed he had been tied up with no chance of escape, the court heard. After the verdict, Mr Varlow's family said of Mohammed: "No punishment could ever be enough for what he has done." O'Shay Swan, 42, of Birmingham, who broke into Mr Varlow's home with Mohammed after the killing, was convicted of burglary and fraud and jailed for six years.
