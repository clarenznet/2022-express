John Lydon, also known by his stage name Johnny Rotten, confessed he has “began to despise Labour Party and their woke agenda”. Despite branding Boris Johnson a “professional liar” amid Partygate and the Sue Gray report, he claimed “I don’t trust anything coming out Labour anymore” and added he would rather vote for Tories as he explained at least he “can rely on hypocrisy” but not on Labour Party’s “lunacy”.

He explained his move by saying: “Sadly, the Prime Minister appears unwilling to bring matters to a head and submit himself to such a vote. Therefore, the only option is for the Conservative MPs to facilitate a vote of confidence. I have already taken the appropriate action”.
