A right-winger with verve and speed, he played for the province 56 times, most notably during the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Sweden in 1958. Although the team was knocked out by France, fans were delighted they had got so far. William Laurence Bingham grew up in a Protestant area of east Belfast. In 1945 he was picked to represent Northern Ireland schoolboys, an achievement which made his shipyard worker father William and factory worker mother Emma very proud. He began carving out a promising career with Glentoran but then joined Sunderland for £8,000. He made more than 200 appearances for the club before joining Luton Town, helping them to reach the FA Cup final in 1959, which they lost to Nottingham Forest. He then made almost 100 appearances for Everton, helping the Merseyside club win the league title in 1963, and had a spell managing the team when his playing career was ended by a broken leg. But the highlight of his managerial career was taking Northern Ireland to the World Cup finals in Spain in 1982, where they beat the host country. His managerial skills and ability to get the most from his players was rewarded with an MBE. He got the team through to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico but they didn’t get past the first round. Bingham married Eunice Oliver and they had two children, David and Sharon. He later married Rebecca Van Strang but they divorced in 2011.
