Kate Middleton and Prince William are in Cambridge to see a painted portrait of themselves today. Both royals dressed smartly for the occasion. Kate is wearing a printed long dress with a baby blue coat on top. Royal fan @CantamessaLisa tweeted: "Lovely interesting pattern on the dress!" Another fan, @ElsLovesWicked said: "I am loving the blues! "The coat on the Duchess of Cambridge is so stunning and what a perfect fit for something that beautiful on someone that beautiful!" Kate went to Cambridge today dressed in an L.K.Bennett Madison dress that she has worn since 2015. Although the exact dress is no longer in stock, an identical one with a different colour retails for £299. The blue and pink animal print dress reaches the Duchess' shins and has flowy shoulder-length sleeves. She paired this with an Emmy London Natasha clutch bag in Riviera Blue Suede.  This is a new purchase for Kate. The bag costs a whopping £370. The description on the website says: "A classic Emmy London kid suede clutch bag in a cool blue-grey suede. "This elegant handcrafted clutch opens to reveal a soft neutral oyster suede lining and zip pocket. "The clutch is roomy enough for your essentials and fastens with a secure magnetic popper. "The delightfully summery blue colour teams well with a variety of outfit colours especially silver and grey shades. "The clutch has a handy detachable silver and leather chain strap." To perfectly match her bag, Kate wore her Emmy London 'Rebecca' Riviera Suede pumps.  These cost £415, and Kate has worn them at many royal engagements. For jewellery, the Duchess wore her aquamarine and diamond drop earrings. Royal fan @KaylaAdams_ tweeted: "Look at our Duchess of Cambridge just glowing today."
