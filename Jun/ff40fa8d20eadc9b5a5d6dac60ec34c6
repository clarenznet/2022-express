Since the Brexit referendum, UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has expanded at an accumulated rate of 6.8 percent. This is more than France's 6.2 percent, Germany's 5.5 percent and Italy's 2.1 percent. In the run up to the 2016 referendum, then Tory MP Anna Soubry warned Britain's trade with the EU would fall "almost absolutely to zero" if people voted leave. However, official data led the Office for National Statistics to note last week that UK exports of goods to the EU increased for the third consecutive month in April 2022 and are at the highest levels since records began. Brexit supporter and journalist Liam Halligan said: "While the evidence so far is mixed, I’d say there are signs - for all the turmoil of recent years and today’s cost of living crisis - that post-Brexit Britain is actually out-performing the EU27." He pointed to growing fears of a re-run of the 2011-12 eurozone crisis, which threatened the collapse of the single currency. Writing in the Telegraph, he concluded: "The stage is indeed set for a re-run of the 2011/12 eurozone crisis. I wonder what the Rejoiners will make of that."  FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
