Silver Voices said 80 per cent of senior citizens are already cutting back on essentials such as food, clothing and heating. Half were most worried about the soaring costs of energy bills and 99 per cent want the basic state pension to be increased now to compensate for the suspension of the triple lock in April. Silver Voices director Dennis Reed said: “Our poll gives a giant thumbs down to the current cost-of-living support package for older people in the UK. “All help is welcome but the one- off payments available to most older people go nowhere near meeting the scale of the inflation crisis and will be quickly gobbled up by surging prices. “The only answer is to ensure that the basic state pension reflects the true rate of inflation. “The Government has to own up to its cruel mistake of suspending the triple lock in April and restore the basic state pension to its rightful level. “Anything else will impose a permanent cut in living standards on millions of state pensioners.” Silver Voices surveyed 1,285 older people about the financial pressures they are facing. An overwhelming 97 per cent believe the Government’s cost of living support package does not provide enough help for older people and nine in ten are worried about how they will cope with rising prices.
