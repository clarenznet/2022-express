Jennifer Lopez showcased her incredible physique as she posted a series of photos of herself in a bikini while poolside to Instagram. "Summer mode: activated," the 52-year-old announced to her 210 million followers, as she pranced around the pool in a black bikini. J-Lo looked a mere fraction of her age as she posed in her skimpy, halter neck two piece. Looking every bit as youthful as in her Jenny From The Block era, she showed off her flat and toned tummy, while accentuating her long, slim legs in a pair of backless beige heels. In a video posted to the site, she twirled around while showing off her patterned floor-length cover-up. The casual garment featured an oriental-style butterfly, peacock and floral print. Even her dog, who was standing nearby, was unable to take his eyes off her as she paraded her fantastic physique. The simple yet effortlessly chic outfit choice won the support of her followers, receiving almost three million likes in a matter of hours. Instagram user @lorenridinger summed up many fans' feelings when she commented: "It just doesnâ€™t get any hotter!" @jenniferxlopezx1 added: "IM LITERALLY SPEECHLESS!" (sic)
