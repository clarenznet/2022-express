Shakira looked downcast as she took her children Milan and Sasha Pique Mebarak to a karate lesson today, just days after announcing her split from her partner of 11 years years, footballer Gerard Pique. The Colombian singer, 45, put on a brave face as she stepped out in a grey t-shirt and black jeans, which she paired with trainers. She wore her fiery tresses in their natural waves which fell down her back. The star clasped her son's hand as she climbed back into the car following the lesson. It comes days after Shakira's communication agency announced the news of the split in a statement which read: "We regret to confirm that we are parting ways. "For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy. Thank you for your understanding."
