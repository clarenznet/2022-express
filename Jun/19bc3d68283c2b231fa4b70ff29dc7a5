Dominic Mark Phillips was born in Bebington on the Wirral. Bitten by the travel bug, quit college to see the world, doing menial jobs to finance trips to Australia, Israel and Greece. Back in Britain in 1988, he settled in Bristol and wrote about dance music. In 2009 he penned the book Superstar DJs HereWe Go! and a few years later edited monthly magazine Mixmag, while writing articles for the national press. Phillips's love for Brazil came from a visit in 1998 to focus on the music culture of Rio de Janeiro. He moved there permanently in 2007 and became a highly regarded foreign correspondent for several titles, including The Times and The Guardian. While learning Portuguese, he married Alessandra Sampaio and they lived at Salvador on the coast. He initially wrote hard news and features but in recent years had concentrated on the threat to rainforests from economic and agricultural development. He also had a passion for fish, particularly the tucunar√©. Pereira was an expert on the indigenous people living in the Javari Valley, near the Peruvian border. It has been claimed the pair were killed by people involved in the illegal fishing trade. Phillips and Pereira vanished on June 5 while travelling by boat on the Itaquai River. Phillips had a passionate argument with Brazil's leader, President Bolsonaro, who told him: "You have to understand that the Amazon is Brazil's, not yours." Friends and supporters are now planning to publish the book he was researching, How To Save The Amazon. Phillips and Pereira vanished on June 5 while travelling by boat on the Itaquai River.
