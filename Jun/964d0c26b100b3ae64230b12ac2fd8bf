Denise Welch, 64, looked relaxed as she was pictured doing some shopping while out and about in Cheshire. The Loose Women panel member cut a casual look in a pair of leggings which she teamed with a light blue sheer top. The ITV favourite added a pair of comfortable flat shoes as she carried two large bags. It comes after the on-screen star opened up to her fellow panellists about the trolling she has experienced, with some people telling her to "shut up" and that she talks too much. Denise was joined by Ruth Langsford, Katie Piper and Jane Moore, as they spoke about filling awkward silences in conversations.
