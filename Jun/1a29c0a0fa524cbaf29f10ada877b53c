Prince William and Prince Harry were just 15 and 12 when Diana, the Princess of Wales died in a car crash in August 1997. Following her death, tensions mounted between Prince Charles and his two sons, who felt "very defensive" of their mother. In recent years, the brothers have "had a real difference in their styles" of how they've dealt with the aftermath of their mother's death. Speaking on Palace Confidential, commentator Sarah Vine discussed the brother's different forgiving paths. Ms Vine said: "After Diana's death, there was this, sort of, iciness a bit and, I think, a lot of recrimination." Despite a rocky start, she notes how William's relationship with his father has "deepened and matured" and "a lot of forgiveness", adding that Harry has "gone the other way". Speaking on Harry's relationship with Charles, she said: "There's almost less forgiveness [than William]. "He's still very angry".
