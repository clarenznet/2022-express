Michelle Keegan, 35, shared a jaw-dropping series of snaps which showed off her toned physique during her solo trip to Cairns, Australia.The actress looked unreal as she put her sculpted abs on display as she posed in a bikini.In other pictures, Michelle cuddled a koala bear, drank cocktails and enjoyed dinners as she explored the city alone.She wrote in the caption: “Last weekend I had some time off work so decided to explore more of Australia and took myself on a little solo trip north to Cairns!  “I ate, drank, met koalas (yes I bought the photo) took a train journey through the rainforest, wandered through the heritage markets and asked a stranger to take a picture of me.  “I had the most amazing time. Yes, travelling alone can be scary but life’s too short to let that fear get in your way! Take the trip, make the memories & capture them to remember forever.”Michelle arrived in Australia last month to film a new six-part BBC series, Ten Pound Poms.
