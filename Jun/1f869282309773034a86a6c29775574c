The middle-distance runner and double Olympic champion said: "The reaction has amazed me. I didn't visualise such support from everyone." Dame Kelly, who chose Pride Month to announce her news after staying silent for 34 years, had admitted she suffered "dark times" when she wished she could have screamed it out but she felt she could not. Boxer Nicola Adams, fellow athlete Denise Lewis and This Morning's Phillip Schofield were among the first to applaud her decision. Adams, 39, tweeted: "I'm so happy for Kelly. Life is short and it's important to be able to be your true self." Schofield, 60, who came out as gay in 2020, wrote: "Kelly, sending a massive hug, don't be scared, I'm sure you'll find everyone is amazing. One day we won't have to do this so publicly." Former heptathlete Lewis, 48, Olympic champion at the 2000 Sydney Games, wrote simply: "Yes Kelly." Dame Kelly, who won gold medals in the 800m and 1500m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, revealed she first realised she was gay when she kissed another female soldier at the age of 17. She told close friends and family in 1997. But she went public only in a Sunday newspaper after years of angst, fearing she could be in trouble for being gay when in the Women's Royal Army Corps. Until 2000, it was illegal for gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve in the Armed Forces. Dame Kelly told of the toll the secret had on her mental health and that at her lowest point she "didn't want to be here". But she added: "I needed to do this now, for me. It was my decision. I'm nervous about saying it. I feel like I'm going to explode with excitement. "Sometimes I cry with relief. The moment this comes out, I'm essentially getting rid of that fear." Dame Kelly followed up the newspaper article by posting on Instagram: "I can finally breathe. Yes, I have been petrified of putting this out. Living with any kind of fear is debilitating."
