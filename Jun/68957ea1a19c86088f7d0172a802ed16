Sophia Loren, now 87, looked amazing in a series of pictures when the age-defying beauty appeared in The Millionairess - a 1960s British romantic comedy film directed by Anthony Asquith. The Hollywood star donned a number of on-screen outfits but one particular look certainly caught cinema-goers attention. The actress sported a black corset with suspenders as she posed beside a table, teaming the sultry attire with a pair of heels, a pink and white hat, matching gloves and pearls around her neck. In one scene, Peter, who starred as the doctor, could be seen attempting to place a coat around the on-screen star, who left little to the imagination in her undergarments.
