Bella and Gigi Hadid looked almost unrecognisable as they took to the runway with half-shaved heads yesterday. The supermodel sisters ensured all eyes were on them as they walked for Marc Jacobs A/W 2022 with prosthetic, partially shaved heads. The dramatic looks were a far cry from their usual voluminous hair dos and saw Bella model a short fringe and long hair behind her ears. She donned a plain white rob to walk down the runway for the minimalist collection. Gigi also modelled a drastic hairdo with her hair kept behind her shoulders and wearing the same blunt fringe as Bella. She wore a pair of pink cargo pants and a white tank top and beige scarf to walk down the runway at the New York Public Library.
