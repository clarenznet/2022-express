According to the RSPCA, two horses were also recovered at the fair, an annual gathering of the Gypsy and Traveller communities in Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria. RSPCA will conduct a full investigation into the treatment of the horses and the sale of the puppies.  But the authority said animal welfare at the celebration was "very good" compared to previous years. More than 10,000 travellers and Gypsies descended on the market town on Thursday for several festivities, which ended on Sunday. Revellers allegedly desecrated a war memorial and left "human excrement everywhere" following the fair. Speaking today, RSPCA Chief Inspector Rob Melloy told Lancs Live: "Two horses have been seized and we will be taking action and there will be a full investigation. We also seized a littler of puppies that were being sold illegally. It has been a very good fair in terms of animal welfare and it has been the biggest since 2015. "This is the biggest planned animal welfare operation in Europe, some people will see bad things and share it on social media but the important thing to do is report it to us and we can take action. "These things happen in both the settled community and the Gypsy and Traveller community, we can't see everything, so if people see things they must report them to us."   When horses change ownership, they can sometimes become overworked. RSPCA warn revellers each year that buying puppies from the fair is not advisable, and often puppies bought there have to be put down. "It is so tragic, but if people continue to buy them at the fair, breeders will continue to bring them each year," Chief Insp Melloy said last year. At last year's fair, RSPCA seized 27 puppies, two of which had to be put to sleep.
