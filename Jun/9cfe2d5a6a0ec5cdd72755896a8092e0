  Naomi wore charcoal, high waisted flared trouser suit pants and paired them with a matching, long suit jacket. The fashion icon wore a salmon pink patterned shirt underneath the suit to give her outfit a pop of colour. She wore her long locks in natural waves that fell past her waistline and kept things low-key with some oversized shades. Naomi, who has a one-year-old daughter named Eloise, accessorised her outfit with a chain link choker and several other layered necklaces.
