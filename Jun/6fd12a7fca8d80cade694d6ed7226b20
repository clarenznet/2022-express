Photos shared online show neglected greenery left unwatered for days. Shopper Annabel Holt called it "such a waste" and "embarrassing" for the Asda in Keighley, West Yorks. She said: "[I've] never seen so many neglected or dead plants outside a supermarket." Gabrielle Jackson, from Dartmoor, said: "My local Co-op is selling a trolley of dead and dying plants." While Sally Wilton said: "I was in our local supermarket today, piled high with plants, none watered, all nearly dead. Why do they bother?" And garden photographer Ian Thwaites shared pictures of trays of wilted petunias "on their final legs" at a Morrisons in Malvern, Worcs. He wrote: "What a shame and what a waste of money. Come on, Morrisons, get the watering can out." Other people have taken to social media to show how wilted plants from stores are thriving under their care. An Asda spokesman said: "We take every care to ensure our plants last as long as possible whilst in our stores. "We do not send any waste to landfill and we donate plants which have not been sold but are in good condition to the local community, including to schools and care homes." A Co-op spokeswoman said: "In the stores where we do sell plants, they arrive fully watered with watering and plant care instructions, with any unsold plants being donated locally." Morrisons said: "This is very much an isolated incident. All of our stores receive full briefings and training on how to care and look after the plants."
