Max Verstappen leads the world championship by 46 points after a dramatic Canadian Grand Prix. The Dutchman held onto victory from a fast-charging Carlos Sainz in the closing stages to secure maximum points on a day his nearest title rivals dropped points. Charles Leclerc was out of position for the race after taking a grid penalty for replacing engine parts. The Ferrari star was able to battle back into the top-five but dropped a handful of points to nearest rival Verstappen. Sergio Perez also failed to capitalise on Ferrariâ€™s struggles after a mechanical failure put him out of the race. The issues promoted Mercedes to their joint-best result of the season with Lewis Hamilton picking up his second podium of the campaign from George Russell in fourth.
