Patrick Grady, 42, had been suspended from Westminster for two days after a parliamentary probe found he acted inappropriately towards a male SNP staff member. Mr Grady, the SNP's former chief whip, said he was "profoundly sorry" after the independent panel's investigation. But the Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is investigating an incident which took place at a London pub in 2016. Mr Grady will no longer be an SNP MP for Glasgow North and will sit as an independent. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford had urged Mr Grady to consider his position after criticism of the party's handling of the complaint. That came after Mr Blackford was heard in a leaked recording telling SNP MPs to rally round Mr Grady, saying he looked forward to "welcoming Patrick back" following his two-day suspension. An SNP spokesman said: "Patrick Grady is stepping away from his party membership while the police inquiry continues." Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: "Patrick Grady should have been sacked long before this but the SNP have shown they have absolutely no backbone and would rather back the perpetrator over the victim."
