The world No 40 is taking on British wildcard Jubb and took issue with a spectator in an x-rated rant to umpire Marija Cicak. "You can't f***ing decide to talk to me in the middle of the point when I'm about to do a backhand, It can't be happening bro," he said as he sat down on serve at 1-2 in the opening set. "They can watch the tennis but speaking and shouting out in the middle of the point, like why? I don't know where it was," he continued.
