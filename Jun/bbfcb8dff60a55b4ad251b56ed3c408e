The grounds of St Paul’s Cathedral were packed with cheering crowds as Her Majesty’s nearest and dearest arrived for a Platinum Jubilee Thanksgiving Service. Despite missing the monarch, they still put on a brilliant show of appreciation for the Queen’s 70-year reign by dressing in Union Jack hats and draping bunting and banners over the railings around the iconic London landmark. It was just as much a family affair for fans outside the cathedral as it was for the royals taking their seats inside. Car saleswoman Jo Lotts, 42, her headteacher wife Cheryl, 44, their seven-year-old son Joseph and Jo’s mum Vivien, 77, had travelled 130 miles from Birmingham to show their love for the 96-year-old monarch. Jo said: “The Queen has given us 70 years of service. We owe her the respect of paying tribute to her for being the brilliant Queen she has been.” Asked if they were disappointed by Her Majesty’s absence, Cheryl said: “She’s done her bit for us over the years. She deserves a rest. It was great to see her enjoy the celebrations on day one.” Sisters Lara and Sarah Draper and their shop assistant mum Marilyn Gabriel, all from Romford, Essex, were determined to make the special day out one to remember. Sarah, 35, explained: “It’s once in a lifetime for us. We won’t see this again.”  Celebrations were also in full swing away from the capital. Morris dancers provided some traditional entertainment in the Essex village of Steeple Bumpstead, jingling and jangling for Jubilee punters outside the Red Lion pub. Meanwhile, street parties were held across the country, including a jam-packed one in Cuckfield, West Sussex. And you might have been forgiven for thinking Her Majesty had turned up in Clubmoor, Liverpool, where street party revellers posed for a group photo with a very familiar-looking cardboard cut-out.
