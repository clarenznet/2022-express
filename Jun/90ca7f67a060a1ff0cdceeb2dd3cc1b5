Sir Cliff Richard, 81, has stunned fans once again at Wimbledon 2022, wearing a stylish grey suit amid the dull cloudy weather. The star appeared in great spirits as he rocked up for the annual tennis tournament for the fourth day in a row.  The singer was dressed in a smart light grey ensemble, complete with black dress shoes, sticking to the formal outfit theme he has been abiding by for the last four days of the tournament.  The age-defying star wore the suit alongside a button-down white, floral shirt and golden tie.  To finish the look, he pinned on his signature red rose to the left lapel of his blazer.  Nick Kyrgios, Rafael Nadal, Katie Boulter and Coco Gauff are players of interest to keep an eye out for on day four.
