More than 1,600 people were asked whether they felt the Prince of Wales was harming the Royal Family by meddling in political matters. It followed leaks of private comments in which he apparently called the Government’s Rwanda deportation plan “appalling.” The comments sparked a row between Downing Street and Clarence House which insisted Charles, 73, will remain politically neutral when he becomes king. The Techne poll found 53 percent felt he was endangering the monarchy, with 20 percent saying he was not and 27 percent unsure.
