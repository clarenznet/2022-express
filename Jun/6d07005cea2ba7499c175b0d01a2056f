Despite forecasts of stormy weather at sea, 138 individuals made the journey in three boats on Thursday. They included a number of women and children. It brought the total figure for arrivals in 2022 to 11,928 - almost double the 5,906 who arrived in the same period last year. So far this month, 2,364 people have reached the UK in 59 dinghies and other craft. The busiest day was on June 14 when 444 people made the treacherous journey across the 21-mile Dover Straits from France. According to official Government figures, 28,526 people risked the crossing in 2021, compared with 8,410 who arrived in 2020. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke has said: "These shocking figures underline yet again why urgent action is needed."
