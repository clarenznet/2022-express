At 4am, the first group of about 40 landed on the beach at Dungeness, Kent, where children were handed grey blankets, above, by soldiers. Ten male migrants then came into Dover at 7.30am, while 50 more men arrived over the next hour and a half. Between 60 and 70 migrants were escorted to shore just before 9.30am, then dozens more were brought into the port at 10.30am. Yesterday's total was a large increase on Tuesday's figure of 25 - with those all arriving in one boat. It took the overall number of people rescued en route to the UK to 2,973 in June so far and 12,537 this year. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: "These shocking figures underline again why urgent action is needed."
