Protesters held banners reading "For Health's Sake Stop Financing Fossil Fuels" and "Fossil Fuels are a Dead End".  The activists were part of a sub-group of Extinction Rebellion (XR) called Doctors for XR. Maggie Fay, one of those involved in the protest, said she believed fossil fuels are a threat to the world.  She explained: "I am a dementia specialist nurse here today because my code of conduct states that I must 'act without delay if you believe that there is a risk to patient safety or public protection'."
