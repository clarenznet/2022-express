Amanda HoldenÂ put on a leggy display as she filmed the second night of the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals. The judge of the talent show, 51, shared a series of snaps to Instagram in a daring violet gown which showcased her perfectly toned pins.  In view of her 1.8 million fans, Amanda stunned in the bespoke gown which was by designer Suzanne Neville. The singer put her perfectly tanned legs on full display thanks to the daring, thigh-high split on the side of the garment. Not wanting to risk her modesty, the gap was secured by two glitzy diamante bands at the top of her leg, protecting the star from a wardrobe malfunction. The red carpet ready gown hugged the star's curves and featured a train which pooled at the bottom of the garment. Glitzy straps at the top of the dress showcased Amanda's ample assests and added a touch of glamour to the outfit. The star accessories with a pair of clear, PVC heels and minimal jewelry, while wearing her hair in a sleek, straight style. Amanda went on to share a timelapse of herself getting ready for the show, which included having her hair and makeup done by a team of experts before she was flanked by a pair of actors dressed as Royal Guards.
