Lewis Hamilton, 37, appeared business as usual on the race track yesterday, only with a slight change in outfit choice as the star strolled around the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Canada.  He was wearing a green floral jacket from the Kenzo fall 2022 collection ahead of Sunday’s Grand Prix.  The stylish athlete matched the jacket with green trousers, chunky boots, and a pair of his own Lewis Hamilton X sunglasses.  He then accessorised his look with rings from King Baby Studio and Gucci.  The Canadian Grand Prix will take place on Sunday and air live at 7pm BST.
