 Images show Hayfield Road in Moseley, located in the south of the city, blocked by police vehicles. One side is blocked by a police car and orange cones, the other by a police van and tape. At time of writing, it is not clear if the road can be accessed by residents.   A local resident, speaking anonymously, told BirminghamLive: “I was walking the dog past there just before 8pm and I saw the police car parked up on the mini-roundabout. “There was a police van parked up at the other end as well with police tape up. “It looked pretty serious.”  Fire control at West Midlands Fire Service confirmed there are no firefighters in attendance. The locked-down road runs between Yardley Wood Road and Wake Green Road.  MORE FOLLOWS...
