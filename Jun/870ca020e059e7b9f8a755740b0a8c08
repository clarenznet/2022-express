Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen’s private talks immediately after the Canadian Grand Prix were caught on camera. The pair exchanged a brief conversation after their epic on-track battle, the first since last year’s Abu Dhabi finale. Hamilton jumped Verstappen as the Dutchman left the pits after his second pitstop. It prompted the Red Bull star to complain to his engineers over team radio in another heated exchange. Mercedes enjoyed an uptick of pace in Montreal this weekend with Hamilton able to hold on to secure his second podium of the season. In the post-race press conference, Hamilton appeared to take a dig at Verstappen ahead of the British Grand Prix. When discussing porpoising issues, Hamilton said Verstappen “didn’t know what I’m talking about”. It comes after Red Bull have repeatedly spoken out against FIA rule changes to address porpoising concerns. Meanwhile post-race, Christian Horner claimed he was “still having nightmares” about the Montreal circuit despite Verstappen’s win. Talking to Jenson Button, the Red Bull team boss said he was worried Verstappen would spin out like Sebastian Vettel did in 2011, which handed Button the win.
