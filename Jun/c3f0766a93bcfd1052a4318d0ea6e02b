She has unseated Harry Styles’ megahit, As It Was, to hit the top spot with Running Up That Hill, 37 years after it was released. The 1985 lead track on her Hounds Of Love album had a resurgence after it was featured in the fourth series of Netflix horror Stranger Things. In the show, Max Mayfield, played by Sadie Sink, is heard listening to the song on her Walkman. The record for the longest sleeper hit was previously held by Wham!, whose Last Christmas topped the Official Singles Chart last year, 36 years after its release. Running Up That Hill is also number one in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, and number four in the US charts. On its original release, it reached number three in the UK and returned in 12th place in 2012. Kate, 63, has also secured the longest gap between number one singles title. Her only other chart-topping moment was in 1978 with her smash-hit debut single, Wuthering Heights. To round off her trio of records, Kate is the oldest female artist to score a UK number one. She replaces Cher, who was 52 when her song Believe topped the charts in 1998. Kate said she was “overwhelmed by the scale of affection and support” for Running Up That Hill. She thanked her fans for making the track number one and praised brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, who created Stranger Things, for “bringing the song into so many people’s lives”. Kate said: “I believe the Duffer brothers have touched people’s hearts in a special way at a time that’s incredibly difficult for everyone, especially younger people.”
