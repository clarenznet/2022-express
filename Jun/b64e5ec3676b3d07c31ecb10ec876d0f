A young woman was sitting in her car when she spotted the man yanking the little pet by its lead down Duncalf Street in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. The upsetting footage went viral after being shared on social media over the weekend, and now the RSPCA and Staffordshire Police are asking for help to identify the man responsible.  The short video shows the man - wearing a grey short sleeve t-shirt, black Nike trainers, black socks and navy knee-length Adidas shorts - tugging on the pup's collar as it lies down, seemingly exhausted, on the pavement near the junction with Lyndhurst Street. When it refuses to get up, the man can be seen pulling it down the road by a lead for several metres. The woman can be heard saying: "What the f**k, what the actual f**k? Is that a f**king joke. What the f**k. Oh my God, I'm going to have to get out the car." Sharing the video on Facebook, she added: "I’ve just witnessed someone dragging their dog up the bank, I tried to video as much as I can, if anyone knows this man please can you report him or let someone know that the dog is ok?!?! I did shout out my car window to tell him to pick the dog up but he literally told me to eff off."  Speaking to the Stoke Sentinel, Staffordshire Police confirmed they were aware of the video. A force spokesman said: "Officers were notified of a video circulating on social media on Saturday whereby a man was recorded being cruel to a dog on Duncalf Street in Burslem. "The man, who is described as white and was wearing a grey short sleeve t-shirt, black Nike trainers, black socks and navy knee-length Adidas shorts, was seen dragging a suspected Shih Tzu dog along the pavement. The video was referred to the RSPCA who are investigating." The RSPCA is asking for anyone who recognises the man to get in touch. A spokesman said: "The RSPCA is aware of this and would urge anyone with any further information on this to contact us on 0300 1234 999. We rely on members of the public to be our eyes and ears and we are very grateful to anyone who reports any concerns to us.”
