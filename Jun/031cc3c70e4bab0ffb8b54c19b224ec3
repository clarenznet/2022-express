Former model Penny Lancaster, 51, flashed a broad grin for the cameras today as she mixed blue and purple hues for a sensational Ascot 2022 outfit. Her one-shoulder white dress featured a blue and lilac floral pattern, which she paired with a blue cape and a statement purple hat. Meanwhile, she kept the accessories simple with a pair of white heels in a peep-toe design, which allowed her to flash her bright blue nails. Despite the royal colour shades in her outfit, husband Sir Rod - who was not with her on the day due to his worldwide tour commitments - recently suffered an embarrassing moment at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert. He performed an explosive rendition of Neil Diamond track 'Sweet Caroline' for Party at the Palace, but it evoked a mixed reaction among fans, some of whom dubbed him a "drunk uncle at a wedding". It also sparked a war of words between him and Elvis Costello on Twitter, after the song choice was branded "s**t".
