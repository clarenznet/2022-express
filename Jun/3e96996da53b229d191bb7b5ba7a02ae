A old strategy guide for a classic PlayStation 1 game has surged in value to be worth almost £500. This news was revealed by retro gaming website PriceCharting, who track the price of countless games, consoles and other collectibles online. The guide that is now worth hundreds of pounds is a Prima Strategy guide for PS1 game Resident Evil: Director's Cut. The Director's Cut of Resident Evil is a re-release of the classic 1996 PlayStation survival horror which adds support for the DualShock controller. And if you bought the accompanying strategy guide for this classic Capcom game you'll make a tidy profit. Every week PriceCharting releases a Hot Items list, which rounds-up the retro gaming collectibles that have increased in value the most. And the Prima Greatest Hits guide for the Resident Evil Director's Cut is on the list of big movers. According to PriceCharting, in the past week this PS1 strategy guide has increased in value by over £50 to £435. It's important to point out that with retro gaming collectibles how much something is worth varies between region. So the UK version of a game may be worth more than the US or Japanese versions, and vice versa. And this is the case with the Resident Evil strategy guide, with the one that has surged in value being the 'Greatest Hits' edition that was released in the US. Still, you may have picked this guide up for a pittance years ago from your local charity shop, car boot sale or from other second-hand sellers and can now turn over a tidy profit. Other retro gaming collectibles that have increased in value recently include Viewpoint for the iconic, arcade-perfect Neo Geo home console as well as the CD add-on for Atari's ill-fated Jaguar console.
