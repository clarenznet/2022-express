Amanda Holden, 51, couldn’t resist the chance to show off her sun-kissed pins on Instagram while posing up a storm on a yacht in Sicily.  The Britain’s Got Talent judge looked half her age as she balanced on a railing on the boat, while looking out towards the horizon.  Amanda opted for a bright orange and white skintight top, which she paired with white bikini bottoms and aviator shades, while showing off her perfectly pedicured feet.  The star teased her return to Heart FM on Monday after enjoying a sun soaked weekend in Italy with her friend, comedian Alan Carr, 46.  It wasn’t long before Amanda was inundated with compliments from admirers comparing her to a Bond Girl, as swimwear designer Melissa Odabash commented: “You are one serious Bond girl.”  Fan Dannymanchip agreed: “Giving me James Bond vibes.”
