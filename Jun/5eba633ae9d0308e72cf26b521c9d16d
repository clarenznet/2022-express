UPDATE: It appears the problems with BBC iPlayer were short lived. The number of reported issues with iPlayer on Down Detector is beginning to plummet, suggesting whatever was troubling users has now been fixed. ORIGINAL: BBC iPlayer reports are spiking today, with users experiencing issues with the app for the streaming service. Independent outage monitor Down Detector has recorded a rise in BBC iPlayer down reports which began after 2.30pm UK time. At the time of writing, Down Detector UK has registered hundreds of reports of BBC iPlayer down. It appears that the reported issues with iPlayer revolve around the app for the service, and not the website. Express.co.uk received an error message when we tried to use the iPlayer app for iPhone. We were greeted with a screen which said: "No network connection. You can still watch downloaded programmes." As the issues hit users took to social networking site Twitter to discuss the problems they were facing. One tweeted: "@BBCiPlayer What is going on with iPlayer right now? Not working at all! No explanation?" While another posted: "The BBC iPlayer doesn't want to work today, my internet connection is working fine but the app says no!" One added: "Excuse me why is my bbc iplayer not working ???" And another wrote: "iPlayer is down".
