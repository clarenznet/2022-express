The ex-Arsenal and England defender feels it is her "responsibility to change perceptions" and will commentate for the BBC during the Uefa Women's Euro 2022 next month. Scott, 37, admitted the transition from football to pundit was not easy. She said: "I've had so many tweets saying I should be at home ironing or cooking." "I don't care about those but sometimes people threaten my life and those have to be taken seriously." "It's my responsibility to change perceptions by sitting in that chair and talking about football." Alex told her BBC boss she "didn't want to be taken off air because then who wins"? She added that more football academies are not helping to address diversity, and said: "An inner-city street kid does not have the financial means to access them."
