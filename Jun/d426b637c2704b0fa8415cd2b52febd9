Amanda Holden, 51, showed age is just a number as she displayed another ensemble from her enviable summer wardrobe. The Britain's Got Talent judge looked amazing as she posed in the green frilly mini dress. The short dress left her endless toned pins on full display as she posed for the camera. She accessorised with a green belt drawing in her petite waist, along with pastel pink heels. Amanda wore her blonde tresses straight, while going for a simple yet elegant make-up palette. The radio presenter also showed off her ballet skills as she posed with her leg balanced on a bar, while risking a near-wardrobe malfunction.
