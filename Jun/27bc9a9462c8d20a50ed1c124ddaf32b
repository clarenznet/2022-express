Deeply upsetting footage shows the moment a large dog grabbed hold of a much smaller breed in its mouth in London. It refused to let go, until forced. A third, also smaller dog was pulled away from the scene. The attacking dog appeared to be off its lead. Two men can be seen grappling with the animals as they try to free the small dog from its jaws. The small dog’s owner let out a chilling scream as she kept hold of her dog’s lead. She also demanded that someone “call the police”. The attack happened in Drayton Park, Islington. Labour Councillor Khayer Chowdhury described the even as “sickening”. He wrote in a post on Twitter: “There needs to be a nationwide crackdown on dangerous dog owners.

Officers have urged the person who uploaded the harrowing video footage to Twitter to get in touch with officers with details.
