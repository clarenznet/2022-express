Forecasters have warned Britons to prepare for record heat today as the fourth day of wall-to-wall sunshine bears down on the UK. Most parts of the country can expect their local temperatures to soar above the summer average. Weather charts have revealed approximate timings for each area in the UK and how hot they could get. While mid-July and August traditionally bring the hottest temperatures of the year, June 2022 promises to kick that precedent to the curb. The week beginning June 13 has already served up the hottest temperatures of the year so far, and they will only accelerate over the next few days. An especially intense plume of heat will bake the UK from today, working north from the south coast to Scotland.

But people living around Southampton, Cardiff, Plymouth and elsewhere in the southwest woke up to 10C to 11C heat. By 9am, those temperatures had moved up to mid-Wales, Birmingham and London, while Cornwall was reporting 13C highs, according to maps from WXCharts. And at 10am, they had risen into the 20C range around Southampton, Peterborough, London and Norwich.

Met Office forecasts show that the night of June 16 promises a challenge, with every part of the country seeing temperatures of 13C or more. London, again, is the hottest and will force residents to reckon with a stifling 20C for the entire night. Areas around the capital promise similar highs ranging from 16 to 18C.  Unfortunately, Friday, June 17, provides no respite, with London, Norwich and Peterborough rising above 30C. After a sweltering morning, the three areas will hit 32C, breaching the usual June maximum by 14C.
