RTE Europe editor Tony Connelly has said he understands the bill has undergone a lot of last minute drafting, and that the UK Government is now focusing more on "implied powers". He said on Twitter the bill will be "lighter on references" to the "dual regulatory regime". Mr Connelly added: "'That tells me that they're looking for a get out of jail card,' says one official familiar with the drafting. 'It will be heavier on the implied powers to ministers than direct powers. So that's a way of saying, we're giving you powers but it's up to ministers how to use them.'" Chief Brexit negotiator Ms Truss is expected to outline the plans in the House of Commons. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
