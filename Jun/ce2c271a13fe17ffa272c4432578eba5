The Queen’s disgraced son, Prince Andrew, 62, had planned on joining members of the Royal Family and other Garter Knights for the annual meeting at Windsor Castle on Monday. Andrew, a Garter Knight since 2006, has maintained a low profile since settling his US legal case over allegations of sexual assault, claims he has always strongly denied.    Now, however, he appears to have planned a notable return to public life, attending the whole medieval ceremony including the service in St George’s Chapel, the grand procession and the members’ lunch. The move – and the fact that it was approved right up until the last minute – is said to indicate both the Duke of York and the Queen’s desire to see him rebuild his public and professional life. However, it was not to be. A last-minute intervention, reportedly at the hands of Andrew’s brother, Prince Charles, and nephew, Prince William, will now see the Duke attend only the private elements of the day. The two future Kings were said to have expressed “significant unease” and the inclusion of the Duke, relegating him to non-public facing duties only.  According to a well-placed source cited by The Sun, Andrew was told to remain out of sight “for his own good” following tense talks with his family. The Duke is understood to have challenged the ban, but was unable to sway his family or senior courtiers. A source close to Andrew said it was the Duke’s “own personal decision” not to attend the public-facing elements of the day, though that has been contested by palace insiders. So what do YOU think?
