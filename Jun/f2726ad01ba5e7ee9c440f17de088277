Eva Longoria, 47, looked incredible in a cut-out black dress as she made a red carpet appearance at the Taormina Film Fest in Italy on Tuesday. The American actress flaunted her toned physique in the elegant floor-length gown, which revealed a hint of her cleavage through lacy mesh detail. The halter neck detail, which gathered at the back in artful straps, accentuated the star's slender frame. Eva sported a theatrical make-up look with smoked-out black wings and pointed eyebrows, teamed with a touch of baby pink lip-gloss. She wore her gorgeous chestnut tresses in a collected bun, leaving accessories to a minimum. She posed alongside Italian–Canadian film producer Andrea Iervolino, 34, who looked incredibly dapper in a stylish navy suit. He grinned with the Desperate Housewives actress, sporting some smart leather shoes to compliment his look. Eva was also snapped alongside Argentine screenwriter Lucía Puenzo, 45, who stunned in a loose scarlet dress worn with some nude strappy sandals. Elsewhere she and Andrea huddled up with producer Chiara Tilesi, director Maria Sole Tognazzi, 51, and actress Sofia Carson for a group picture.
