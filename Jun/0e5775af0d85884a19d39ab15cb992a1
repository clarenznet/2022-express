As Emma celebrated turning 44, she called her beloved husband's kisses “truly the best”. In view of her 352k followers, Emma posted a video sitting on the sofa with the Sixth Sense star as he cradled her face and covered her in kisses. “Birthday morning kisses are truly the best,” she wrote. Her post comes months after the Hollywood star announced that he was stepping away from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia - a condition that affects his cognitive abilities. According to the Mayo Clinic, aphasia is "a condition that robs you of the ability to communicate" and can be caused by a stroke, head injury, brain tumour or a disease.
