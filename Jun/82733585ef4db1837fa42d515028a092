These strikes are a disgrace. How are folk supposed to get to work and hospital appointments etc, and what about medical and ancillary workers to staff those hospitals? We could be faced with months of disruption on our rail network due to prolonged industrial action. I just hope that during these strikes none of the rail workers or their families require hospital treatment for any serious matter, and find no staff on duty because they can't get to work. I have no sympathy or respect for the railway strikers who are holding the country to ransom, says Robert Readman, from Bournemouth, Dorset. Had the Government not pumped billions into the railways during the pandemic, many of the strikers would have found themselves out of a job. However, I am astonished that given the pay rises they have enjoyed, MPs can take their greedy snouts out of the trough long enough to urge pay restraint on us lesser mortals. Whatever happened to leading by example? The last time I voted for Labour was when Tony Blair was leader, says Bill Tait, from Leigh, Lancs. I have not voted for them since and can't believe I will ever again after seeing the photograph of the former Shadow Home Secretary side by side with union boss Mick Lynch, backing the rail strike.
