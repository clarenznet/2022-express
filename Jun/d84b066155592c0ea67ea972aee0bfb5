Soldiers from the Wagner Group, a private militia with alleged close links to the Kremlin, have been using a local sports stadium in Kadiivka as a training base. The stadium was targeted by Ukrainian forces yesterday, resulting in the deaths of up to 300 Russian mercenaries, according to reports. Serhiy Hayday, the head of Luhansk's regional administration, tweeted: "Wagner base in occupied Luhansk region was destroyed, only one survived. The enemy base is located at the local stadium in Kadiivka, which the Russians brazenly occupied in 2014." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LATEST UPDATES
