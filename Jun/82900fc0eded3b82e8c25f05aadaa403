Coronation Street fave Sally Carman was enjoying some down-time away from the cobbles, spending it soaking up the sun in a hot tub. "A sunny Friday evening to myself? Itâ€™s got hot tub written all over it," she gloated on Instagram. The 41-year-old actress confessed to fans just two days later that she had been suffering the worst flu of her life. However fans were quick to point out that it was impossible to tell in her glammed-up photos, where she sparkled in sunglasses and a wide brimmed straw hat.
