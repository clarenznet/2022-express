The Charity Commission says it will not need to speak to him because he is not a trustee of the charity to which he handed over the money. But it is still considering a formal probe.  A spokeswoman said: “We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter.” Between 2011 and 2015 Charles, 73, received three payments of a million euros each from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, an ex-prime minister of Qatar and businessman worth £2billion.  The Prince passed the cash, including one stash in a suitcase, on to The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund, which insisted it carried out all necessary checks before accepting. Charities can take large cash donations but must be alert to money laundering.
