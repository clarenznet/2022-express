Police Scotland confirmed that officers are investigating an alleged "sexual assault" at a school in Edinburgh on Friday, May 27. The report will be given to the Scottish Children's Reporters Administration (SCRA), reports Edinburgh Live. Parents with children at the school have said they believe that a "school pupil was allegedly held down and sexually assaulted by two other pupils." Two P7 pupils, aged 11 or 12, are reportedly suspected of attacking a younger pupil in a school toilet. One family member of a student at the school claimed that one of the alleged perpetrators had been allowed back into the premises under supervision. They said that they feel the school is a "disgrace" for trying to keep the information from parents and have questioned the ethics of senior staff for allowing one of the children involved to return. One dad said that the school "cannot treat this with a slap on the wrists, they must protect the other students." Another parent said that those with children at the school were despondent with what was going on and that they were demanding answers on the punishment handed out to those alleged to be responsible. It is understood that Police Scotland and officials at Edinburgh City Council have investigated the incident. The "assault" was claimed to have taken place in the school toilets and it was claimed that it involved two older pupils targeting a younger student.  A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "We received a complaint relating to a sexual assault at a school in the Edinburgh area on Friday, 27 May, 2022. "An investigation has been carried out and officers have liaised with the school and local authority. "A report into the circumstances will be submitted to the Scottish Children's Reporters Administration (SCRA)." An Edinburgh City Council spokesperson said: "The welfare of all children in our schools is a priority and we supported Police Scotland with their enquiries."
