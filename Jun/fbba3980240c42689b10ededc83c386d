Fortnite fans can download a brand new update on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and Nintendo Switch. The new Fortnite hotfix doesn't make too many changes, but there are a couple of interesting new additions. The headline feature is the return of the Flare Gun, which has been unvaulted and re-skinned. It can be found in floor loot, chests and supply drops. Epic explains more: "It’s the good vibes Season, so why not add some fireworks? With the Firework Flare Gun, you won’t be shooting a standard flare. "Instead, every shot you take will be a fireworks show. The area where the firework shell explodes will be set aflame, causing the start of a spreading blaze." In addition to bringing back the Flare Gun, Epic is spotlighting the recently released Ripsaw Launcher for the upcoming week. "Take up a Ripsaw Launcher to send a sawblade flying," the company continues. "Even after gravity sends the sawblade to the ground, it’ll roll and create chaos in its path. Whether flying or rolling, the sawblade will destroy each structure in its way, potentially felling towering builds. "Sawblades also have the power to damage (and knock back) players and cars. Ripsaw Launchers contain multiple sawblades, so send sawblades in spades." As part of Ripsaw Launcher Week, the item can be found within Floor Loot, Chests and Supply Drops.
