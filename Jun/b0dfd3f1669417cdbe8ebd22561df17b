Sylvester Stallone, 75, looked dapper last night as he attended a dinner hosted by Finch & Partners for the launch of Paramount+ UK. The star-studded event took place at Chiltern Firehouse in Londonâ€™s Marylebone and saw the legendary actor recycle a look from the night before. Sylvester also wore the sleek navy suit and black shirt outfit on Monday evening to the Paramount+ UK Launch event. The first night he completed the elegant look with some burgundy shoes, while, for the second party, he switched things up with snakeskin toe cap shoes.
