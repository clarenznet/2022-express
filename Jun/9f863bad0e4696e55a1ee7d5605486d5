Millie Gibson, 17, played deeply emotional scenes in Coronation Street last year as her character, Kelly Neelan, was jailed for someone else's actions, while this year she came to terms with the death of her ailing mother Laura (Kel Allen). Laura posed as the killer of Kelly's father to protect the real killer, Gary Windass (Mikey North), as she knew that she was dying - and she carried the secret to her grave, though it meant her daughter refused to see her in her final hours. Millie looked sensational this evening as she took to the red carpet in a floor length white satin dress. Her blonde hair was worn loose, while she accessorised with simple but effective jewellery pieces, such as a bangle worn on one arm. Despite a different demeanour during some of her tense Corrie scenes, Millie looked confident and happy at the ceremony as she rocked her backless Grecian style gown.
