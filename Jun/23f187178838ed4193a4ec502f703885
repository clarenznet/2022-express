  Boy George has accused British Airways of “leaving everyone in first class waiting”, while Victoria Beckham was “picked up at the aircraft” in a now-deleted explosive tweet. The pop star took to social media to call out the airline, who he threatened to “avoid for a while” because of the way he claimed he was treated.      Boy George, 61, took to Twitter yesterday to air his frustrations about a recent flight with British Airways. He declared he would be “avoiding the airline” due to the way its first class passengers were treated in a since-deleted tweet. The Culture Club singer claimed to his 480,700 followers that part of the reason he was so enraged was because Victoria Beckham, 48, had apparently received preferential treatment when she was “picked up at the aircraft” ahead of other passengers. Boy George claimed that while all the other first class passengers were left waiting, British Airways allowed the former Spice Girl’s car to collect her directly from the plane.

The trio are set to perform at London’s Kenwood House tomorrow night. Victoria has not mentioned any recent travels on her social media, but her husband David Beckham, 47, and their daughter Harper, 10, have recently spent time together in Venice. This isn’t the first time Boy George has spoken about Victoria. He has previously made cheeky comments about Posh Spice to Kyle and Jackie O on their KIIS 1065 radio show. READ MORE...

As a judge on The Voice Australia, he even went as far as to ban one of his acts, Vangelis, from performing the girl band’s famous tune Viva Forever.      Boy George insisted: “The Spice Girls are awful. I hate them. They’ve just got nothing to say. “Girl power. Yeah, and what the f*** is girl power? F*** the Spice Girls. He added: “They are a cynical corporate creation and proof that a good stylist is more important than a good melody.” Express.co.uk has contacted Victoria Beckham and British Airways for comment.
