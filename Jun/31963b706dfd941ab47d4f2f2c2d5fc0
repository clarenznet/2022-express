Nearly one in five (17 percent) turn to the feeling in their gut to tell them if something’s wrong when it comes to their health, while 20 percent rely on their intuition to guide them when it comes to trusting a partner. And 21 percent think their gut will influence their dreams if it’s trying to tell them something. But despite being ruled by this part of their anatomy, 36 percent are unaware of the gut’s importance to overall wellbeing. And 40 percent don’t know the role diet plays in gut health – and, despite fibre supporting good gut health, only seven percent know how much they should be eating. NHS doctor and registered associate nutritionist, Dr Joshua Wolrich, who is working with California Almonds, which commissioned the research, said: “While there’s a lot we don’t know about the gut, we do know there’s trillions of bacteria living in it – our gut microbiota. “Changes to the microbiota are associated with multiple health concerns, including heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes. “Food is its main fuel, so a balanced diet is critical, and fibre is crucial to supporting healthy gut activity. “Research has found that eating almonds, a high fibre food, may improve the gut microbiome by increasing its diversity, while also decreasing relative levels of potentially harmful bacteria.” The study also found half of adults are unaware of the common symptoms of an unhappy stomach – with 72 percent failing to recognise disturbed sleep as a sign there could be something more serious wrong. Another 22 percent have struggled to perform at work when they were having a digestive issue, and a quarter claimed to not want to socialise as often as before. But the study, carried out via OnePoll, found having a healthy diet (60 percent), sufficient water intake (54 percent), and quality sleep (43 percent) are among some of the positive ways to improve gut health.
