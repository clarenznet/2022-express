Back in the 1970s we were known as the “Sick man of Europe” because of the constant strikes by greedy unions only interested in power by supporting the Labour Party. The only reason we have been a powerhouse for the last 40 years is because of the strength of Maggie Thatcher who took the fight to them and won. If we let the unions and Sir Keir Starmer take over we will be the laughing stock of Europe as we lose everything the past generations have fought for. Susan Dance, Harrogate, N Yorks ------------------------------------------- Peaceful protests at union offices and leaders’ homes Maybe the people affected by this week’s rail disruption could carry out a peaceful protest outside the offices and homes of rail union officials and MPs who support this action in their area. Anthony Gray, Hunstanton, Norfolk ------------------------------------------- RMT boss taking the Mick if he thinks Labour cares Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, says that Labour should be backing working class people who are struggling (“No surrender to the militants bringing chaos”, June 20). Mr Lynch doesn’t appear to have noticed that Labour stopped caring about the working class in May 1997, when it became the party of both the metropolitan middle class and a feral subclass that it offensively thought of as the working class. Stefan Badham, Portsmouth, Hants ------------------------------------------- Starmer knows he can’t bite hand that feeds him Labour's Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are at the forefront of the unions’ push for better pay. Of course they are, as union funds pour into Labour’s coffers so they have little alternative. Imagine what it could be like if Labour was in power again. Today’s strikes would soon lead to other unions taking similar action and probably bringing this country to a complete standstill. Michael Carter, Rickmansworth, Herts
