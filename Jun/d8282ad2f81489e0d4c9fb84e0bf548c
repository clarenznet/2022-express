Louise Redknapp, 47, stunned as she shared footage of herself in a casual black tracksuit with a pale grey sweatshirt tied around her waist following a Pilates workout. The cropped style of her top meant viewers caught a glimpse of her trim waistline. The mum of two wore her blonde tresses scraped into a backcombed ponytail and boasted a glowing complexion following her workout. "Starting the morning in one of my fave places!" Louise captioned the image. Meanwhile, her ex-husband Jamie was featured in pictures thanks to his doting wife Frida, which included one of him on a yacht where he boasted tiny shorts and a toned, bare chest. Last year, Jamie and Frida welcomed their son Raphael Anders Redknapp after getting married.
