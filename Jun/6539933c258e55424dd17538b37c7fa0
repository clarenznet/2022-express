The Duke of York, 62, has asked the Queen to be reinstated as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, it has been claimed. He has reportedly tried to persuade the monarch to restore his royal status so he can return to official events. Andrew is also reported to have been lobbying for his daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, to be made working royals. A source said: "The colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards was his most coveted title and he wants it back. Having remained a Counsellor of State, he also believes he should be included at royal and state events." "Most importantly for him is his status as an HRH and 'Prince of the Blood' and he feels that should be reinstated and his position recognised and respected." Weekend reports suggested Prince Andrew could swap Berkshire for Scotland as part of a bid to rebuild his life away from the public gaze in the wake of the Virginia Giuffre sex allegations scandal. The Queen is reported to have held family meetings at Windsor Castle to establish what role the Duke could fulfil. It is said that one option was for him to rebuild his life in Scotland. But he wishes to keep his Royal Lodge estate in Windsor, where he was seen riding at the weekend. Andrew is set to make a return to public life today when he attends the Garter Day service at Windsor Castle.
