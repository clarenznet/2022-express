Strictly Come Dancing pro Aljaz Skorjanec and fellow pro dancer Janette Manrara, who also dazzles as a presenter, were looking glamorous at today's British Soap Awards. Janette sizzled in an off the shoulder style burgundy satin gown which trailed captivatingly behind her on the floor. Meanwhile Aljaz opted for a classic black suit and white shirt, with exquisite tailoring. The pair, who have been married since 2017, flashed broad grins for the camera as they captured attention on the red carpet.
