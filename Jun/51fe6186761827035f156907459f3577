Police were called over "concerns for the welfare of a woman" and Dr Antonella Castelvedere, 52, is said to have bled to death at the scene. An injured man allegedly discovered in the Victorian house at Colchester, Essex, last Wednesday has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Essex Police did not reveal the name of the dead woman but Italian media identified her as Dr Castelvedere, a mother of two and a lecturer who had lived in Britain for 25 years. It is claimed she had suffered knife wounds. The University of Suffolk said: "Our community is deeply saddened by the untimely death of Dr Castelvedere. "She was a widely respected and well-liked member of staff and an outstanding academic in English and critical writing." Detective Chief Inspector Antony Alcock, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, explained inquiries into the death "suggest this was an isolated incident and there is no threat posed to the public". Dr Castelvedere was from the northern Italian town of Bagnolo Mella in the province of Brescia in the Lombardy region. Her father Spartaco, a former director of an agricultural consortium, her mother Mina and brother Ferruccio still live in the town. Neighbours, who placed flowers outside her home where she had lived since 2016, described her as "quiet" and "well liked". Student Lauren Jean Barton posted on Facebook: "What a tragic loss. Antonella had a smile and laugh that was infectious. She mentored me and was the most inspiring teacher."
