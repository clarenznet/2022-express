Watched by adoring mum Kate, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis made sweet treats by royal command. And it was history in the baking as their delicacies – to mark their great granny’s historic 70-year reign – were scoffed at a street party in Cardiff.  A proud Duchess of Cambridge looked on as George, eight, Charlotte, seven, and Louis, four, mixed sticky ingredients together before carefully icing the goodies. The shots posted by Kate yesterday show the enthusiastic youngsters hard at work in their patriotically decorated Norfolk kitchen. The Duchess, wearing a £129 Brora pink gingham blouse, captioned them: “Baking cakes for the community in Cardiff to enjoy at a Platinum Jubilee street party. We hope you like them!” They were delivered to the Friends of Llwynfedw Gardens on the family’s surprise visit to the Welsh capital.
