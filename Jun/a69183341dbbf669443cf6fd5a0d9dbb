South Wales Police said officers will be patrolling hotspots to "provide reassurance" and aim to identify anyone who may be "displaying signs of concerning or predatory behaviour". The officers will be working alongside uniformed colleagues, who will intervene and take positive action to discourage the behaviour if it takes place.  Detective Inspector Carl Morris said the likelihood of such an incident happened was "incredibly low", but the force was committed to making sure Swansea was safe to all who live and visit. It comes as temperatures are set to rise this week and forecasters say the peak will be on Friday when many parts of England and Wales are likely to see the hottest day of the year so far. The Met Office forecasts increasingly warm weather in the south from Wednesday as high pressure builds. This will bring settled conditions allowing temperatures to build day-on-day and for it to become warm, or even hot, by the end of the week. According to Wales Online, Detective Inspector Morris said: “This initiative is focusing on events running in Swansea as well as beach and park locations. It’s been arranged in order to ensure that anyone visiting these areas in Swansea during the summer months can have an enjoyable time, without the fear of being subjected to unwanted behaviour. "By using specialist officers we are able to identify any concerning behaviour first hand and intervene quickly.   “I would like to provide reassurance that the likelihood of becoming a victim of any type of unwanted behaviour, whether that be of a sexual or physical nature, is incredibly low, but that does not limit the harm done on those occasions when such crimes do take place. "We are taking these steps in order to provide greater reassurance to the public and to prevent incidents developing and occurring. "South Wales Police is committed to making Swansea safer and this is just one way in which we are working to tackle any concerning or predatory behaviour.”
