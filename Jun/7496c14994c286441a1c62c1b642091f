The TV presenter walked with his new love, Katie, 32, as the pair headed to snazzy celebrity hotspot Soho House in White City.  Nick Knowles, 59, grinned for the camera as he strolled with Katie to the venue for a romantic evening on Wednesday night.  DIY SOS host wore beige chinos, a grey T-shirt and a leather jacket, as well as brown leather shoes, going for a casual look.  Nick threw his dark locks back away from his face, as he sported neat facial hair.  Katie, meanwhile, opted for boot-cut blue jeans, a cropped white jumper and white shoes, as she let her natural curls flow down her shoulders.  She wore natural-looking make-up, as well as heart-shaped silver earrings and freshly manicured pink nails.
