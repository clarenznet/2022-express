Mohamed Salah would prefer to join another Premier League club if he ends up leaving Liverpool upon the expiry of his contract, according to reports. The Egyptian, who shared this season's Golden Boot with Tottenham Son Heung-min, is still yet to agree terms over a new deal meaning his contract is due to expire in the summer of 2023. Salah has already confirmed he'll be staying at Liverpool next season whatever happens but the longer the saga rumbles on, the more likely the 29-year-old looks to leave. The Athletic are now reporting that Salah would favour a Premier League move if he was unable to agree a contract extension. The revelation is likely to place the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United on alert ahead of an interesting 12 months. Although Salah would be expected to move abroad out of respect for Liverpool, there is nothing to suggest staying in England is not beyond the realms of possibilities.
