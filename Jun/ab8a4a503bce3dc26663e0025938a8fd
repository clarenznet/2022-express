London has been named the worst region in the UK for having a car stolen according to new research. Greater London came out on top of the list undertaken by GoShorty, who analysed data from a series of Freedom of Information requests and government sources to reveal the worst areas in the UK for theft of a vehicle. London was shown to be the UK’s car theft hotspot with the highest rate of theft or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle at 277.55 offences per 100,000 people. Over a year that works out at a staggering 68 cars stolen every single day. Only two other areas, South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, also had rates above 200, which were 222.95 and 217.18 offences per 100,000 people respectively. London also saw the most thefts of belongings from a vehicle with 687.51 per 100,000. READ MORE: TAX THEM!

The study also looked at the most common car crimes in general, and the areas where they are most prevalent. Breaking the speed limit was by far the most common offence in the UK, with just over 1.87 million recorded instances in 2020 alone. Lincolnshire is the UK’s speeding hotspot having recorded the highest per capita rate of speed limit offences in the country, with 13,420.07 offences per 100,000 people.

The next most common car crime was theft from a vehicle and third was criminal damage to a vehicle, with 158,041 recorded crimes. This offence refers to when someone knowingly causes damage to another person’s vehicle, such as scratching the paint or breaking a window. The damage is often caused in response to arguments between the owner and the offender, as an act of mindless vandalism, or is done during an attempted robbery. Cleveland, a historical county in the North East of England, has the highest rate of criminal damage to vehicles in the country, with 430.33 offences per 100,000 people. Fourth on the list of offences was theft of a vehicle which London came out on top of by quite some distance. Then fifth was "vehicle insurance offences" - it’s a legal requirement in the UK for all vehicles to have a basic level of insurance so that other road users are protected in the event of an accident. Driving without insurance will land you with a £300 fine and six points on your licence, though if the case goes to court you could get an unlimited fine and be outright disqualified from driving. Norfolk has the highest rate of vehicle insurance offences in the country at 292.23 per 100,000 people. Other places to score highly were Humberside, which recorded a rate of 262.41 per 100,000 people, and Leicestershire, where the rate is 228.42 per 100,000. Elsewhere, car crimes that made the top 20 included neglect of traffic directions, seat belt offences and positive or refused breath testing. Some of the less common included neglect of pedestrian rights, death or injury by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking.
