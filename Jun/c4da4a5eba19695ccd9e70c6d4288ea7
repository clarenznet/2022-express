That’s why they “lent” Boris their votes, giving him a massive majority at the last general election. They never voted for woke, wet, Left-wing, politically correct policies from him. If they had wanted that they would have voted for a different political party. Come on Boris, do what you were elected to do, or the Conservatives will lose the next general election. Ann Wills, Ruislip, Middx --------------------------------------- Voters shoot themselves in the foot at by-elections After last week’s by-election results in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton, it is clear Vladimir Putin has no need of his massive nuclear bombs to wipe out Britain. The Brits can do it themselves. John Green, Reading, Berks --------------------------------------- There’s nowt so queer as folk who abandoned Tories In 2019 the Labour voters of Wakefield switched to Conservative because their party was pro-Europe, soft on immigration and had done nothing for their city. Events since then have shown how right they were. Despite all this, they’ve now decided to switch back to Labour in the by-election. As they say in Yorkshire, “There’s nowt so queer as folk.” Roy Daniels, Luton, Beds --------------------------------------- If BA goes on strike then how will anyone know? Your headline regarding the proposed British Airways strike made me smile (“BA strike...another holiday blow”, June 24). Is anyone going to notice that they’re on strike? Surely it won’t be any different to normal days as BA has cancelled so many flights recently. Sue Buttle, Stockport, Cheshire
