Alicia Robinson, 28, and Robin Newsome, 32, believe the man - who they claim showed "no remorse whatsoever" and "hit their pet on purpose". The pair were at their home in Halifax, West Yorkshire when the driver allegedly hit their cat yesterday (June 7).    One-year-old Ice was rushed to the vets, but sadly died from his injuries, reports Yorkshire Live. Remembering the aftermath, Robin said: "He got out of the car and thought it was funny. He just wrecked our family."  The man, who was unknown to the couple, did pass on his details, but had "a smile on his face, laughing, sniggering," according to Alicia. Ice's distraught owners, who believe he would have been clearly visible, fear the driver purposely ran him over. Robin said: "It is cruelty to animals. There is no way you cannot see an all pure white cat." He later added: "Every driver should be taking care, that could have been a child." The couple said they reported the driver to the RSPCA, and they plan to contact the police. They also sent him the vet's invoice but have not heard back. Now, they are calling on him to "to do the decent thing" and pay so they can cremate their pet and bring his ashes home. "We as a family are broken," said Robin. People flooded to Yorkshire Live's Facebook page with comments condemning the driver's actions. Michelle Stanley commented: "Have his car crushed in front of him and laugh - see what it feels like to have something you love being crushed". Jackie Morris wrote: "A beautiful cat, what a horrible person to do this". While Yvonne Radcliffe said: "Definitely hand his details to the police".
