  Amanda, 51, joined her Heart Radio co-presenter Ashley Roberts, 40, for a sweet photo on her social media page this morning. The pair were seen giggling as Amanda showed off her white blouse with black polka dots, while Ashley stunned in a bright pink and orange ensemble. Amanda paired the stylish blouse with some figure-flattering white trousers and matching stiletto heels. She tagged the brands Zara and ME+EM for her outfit, while also crediting her stylist Karl Willett and personal assistant Adele Pentland for her expertly curled locks and glossy makeup look.
