New government data recently showed nine people across England, Scotland and Wales have died in crashes this year involving e-scooters, which are similar to mopeds. The number of people injured in e-scooter collisions has rocketed, according to a road casualties report published by the UK Government. Across Britain, there were 1,280 collisions involving e-scooters last year alone, compared to the much lower figure of 460 in 2020. In 2021, the reported collisions resulted in a staggering 1,359 casualties and nine deaths. In 2020, the collisions resulted in 484 injuries and a single fatality. Almost 40 per cent of injuries involving e-scooters in Britain last year were in London, the data shows. Some 510 casualties were recorded in the capital by the Met Police, more than twice as many as in 2020.
