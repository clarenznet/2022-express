Romeo Beckham’s, 19, girlfriend, Mia Regan, also 19, displayed her enviably toned frame in a chic lace dress during a solo outing last night. She was attending the Royal Academy of Arts Summer Party in London on Wednesday. Mia sported a lace scalloped mini dress paired with leather biker boots as she posed for the cameras without her beau by her side. She wore her hair in waves as she matched the outfit with a mixed palette of make-up. It comes after news that Romeo was experiencing heartbreak as he was separated from his beloved girlfriend, and the two have been forced to resort to video conferencing apps to stay in touch. The model shared a video on her story yesterday, with the caption: “Long distance,” along with a red heart. Romeo reposted the video, adding: “I miss youuuuuu”.
