The world's second-largest fashion retailer, which also owns Cos and Weekday, said it would publish accounts for the period at the end of the month. It is also expected to outline the impact of inflation. Analysts said - like rival Inditex, owner of Zara - H&M has benefited from the sharp return to stores as pandemic restrictions eased. Elsewhere, Sainsbury's has cut prices on 250 of its best-selling items to match rival Aldi. The cuts are part of a two-year, Â£500million investment to drive sales growth and shield shoppers from inflation.
