Penelope Cruz, 48, made sure to turn heads as she stepped out for the Tribeca Film Festival in promotion of her latest movie, Official Competition. As ever, Penelope looked a mere fraction of her age. Her floor-sweeping sequin number might have been demure in length, but the designer gown also featured a daring off-the-shoulder style on one side, revealing a sneak peek of her voluptuous cleavage. The beauty's glamorous Chanel dress was paired with a pair of matching black peep-toe heels. The Oscar-winning actress mentioned that she was thrilled to be out and about again after struggling with creating a film during the Covid pandemic.
