The detective leading the investigation, Sergeant Matt Doohan, said: “The investigation into this offence, and what took place, is in its early stages. "This incident has occurred in the very early hours of Saturday morning when members of the public were likely to have been asleep. “However, we need the support and help of our communities to bring those individuals who are willing to endanger others by using firearms and knives on the streets of London to justice and to help us in preventing further people from being injured in similar circumstances. “If you do not wish to speak with police, and to stay completely anonymous, please contact the charity Crimestoppers.”
