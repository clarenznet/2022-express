If you're trying and failing to make a Zoom call today you are not alone. The chat app is currently down and not working with thousands of reports flooding in from across the UK. Things appear to have gone offline around 3.15 pm BST with the gremlins still ongoing. This massive outage could not have come at a worse time for UK workers with many staying at home today due to the national rail strike. This may have placed added strain on Zoom's video network although there's no official word on what's causing the problems. Independent outage monitor Down Detector, which tracks issues across the web, is currently showing a huge spike in Zoom down reports with the vast majority of issues surrounding online connectivity problems. At the time of writing over 1,000 reports per minute are flooding in. Along with Down Detector issuing an alert, Zoom users have also flocked to social media platforms to vent their frustration. Speaking on Twitter, one user called Christina, said: "This is going to be a fun day of hybrid work with Zoom down!" Another, named Thomas, asked: "Hi, I canâ€™t join Zoom right now. Is Zoom server down now?" Some Zoom customers have also posted screenshots online that appear to show the app constantly showing a spinning wheel but never connecting. Zoom is yet to make an announcement on the outage but Express.co.uk will update this story when we hear more. It's not just Zoom struggling under the pressure with Outlook users also suffering from gremlins today. Many have suffered from delays in sending and receiving messages with Microsoft confirming that its servers have been struggling. Posting a message online, the US tech firm said: "Some users may be unable to access their mailboxes via any connection method "We've identified that our traffic management infrastructure is not working as expected. We're continuing to monitor the service availability as it improves, while we determine the root cause." BREAKING STORY...MORE FOLLOWS
