A series of tests were given to 9,000 youngsters aged nine or 10 in the US to measure their mental abilities. Those who spent more time playing games experienced a significant increase in their intelligence scores when retested two years later. Study author Professor Torkel Klingberg, of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said: "This is consistent with several experimental studies of video game playing." The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
