The campaigner, who revealed last month she is having at-home hospice care, told ITV's Lorraine she was tired of seeing just cute "puppies" on the wrapping. In a video clip, the "Bowelbabe" podcaster added: "We need actual information signposted on those loo rolls." Dame Deborah, 40, appeared on the show to salute her friend Cara Hoofe, 38, who pressured her employer M&S to include what symptoms to look for on its own-brand products. The mum of two told Cara, who has also fought the disease: "Congratulations Cara. I'm so pleased you are talking about the hard work that you have put in and what you have achieved. "We've both gone through bowel cancer and we've spoken so many times about getting symptoms on loo roll but you finally did it and I'm really proud of you for doing that. "We should now do a big shout out to other companies. I'm hoping big brands will go 'yeah, hang on, this makes massive sense.This is what we need to be doing'." M&S, in partnership with Bowel Cancer UK, announced plans to add symptoms of the disease on toilet roll labels last month. It also made a £50,000 donation to the charity. Cara came up with the idea, after being diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer and submitted it to the retail giant's new colleague suggestion scheme. She said yesterday: "I'm over the moon." Dame Deborah's JustGiving site has raised £6.6million for Cancer Research UK in just a month and the former teacher was personally awarded her damehood by Prince William three weeks ago.
