In April, it was announced the UK Government had struck a deal to deport people who arrive in Britain illegally thousands of miles away to Rwanda, and the High Court didn't block the process from starting next week. A source told The Times that Prince Charles was heard expressing his disdain for the policy in private, stating: "He said he thinks the Government's whole approach is appalling. It was clear he was not impressed with the Government's direction of travel." A Clarence House spokesman said: "We would not comment on supposed anonymous private conversations with the Prince of Wales, except to restate that he remains politically neutral. Matters of policy are decisions for Government."   As a senior member of the Royal Family and a future King, Charles may be expected to stay out of political debates just like the Queen. But he has attracted criticism in the past for being outspoken with his views. Former Brexit Party leader and broadcaster Nigel Farage has now waded into the debate, tweeting: "Unless Prince Charles wants to destroy the monarchy he had better shut up fast." So do you think Charles was right to have reportedly criticised the Government's policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda? Or should Charles stay out of political matters altogether?
