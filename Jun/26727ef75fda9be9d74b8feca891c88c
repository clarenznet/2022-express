Police and paramedics rushed to the supermarket in Longwell Green, Bristol, at around 10am as shoppers and staff were told to leave the store. Officers were able to diffuse the situation and calm the man, who was cared for by ambulance staff at the scene. No one was hurt despite the tense confrontations, Bristol Live reports. A photograph taken outside the large supermarket shows a crowd of shoppers outside the building. At least one police car has also been spotted at the scene. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said: "We were called to the Asda, in Craven Way, Longwell Green, at 10am this morning (Wednesday 8 June) following reports of a man with a knife. "The supermarket was evacuated while officers spoke to the man. He has now been detained awaiting the ambulance service following concerns for his welfare. "No one has been injured and officers believe this to be an isolated incident and the store has now reopened."  The Asda, one of the largest supermarkets in Bristol, is in the east of the city. It has a cafe, pharmacy, opticians and a travel money bureau. A spokesperson for Asda said: "Our Longwell Green store was closed for a short time this morning following a police incident. We would like to thank our colleagues and Avon and Somerset Police for their swift responses and can confirm that the store is open again as usual." When a Tesco was evacuated recently in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, authorities found a "suspicious package". An employee said they felt shaken but suggestions "toxic gas" had been released inside the store after the air conditioning had allegedly exploded were dismissed. Nevertheless, witnesses had reported the aircon unit blew up and fell straight from the ceiling near aisle seven. It is understood there were fortunately no shoppers in the aisle at the time.
