   Elizabeth, who lived between 1932 and 2011, was a British-American actress who became the world’s highest-paid movie star in the 1960s. She made her first film appearance in 1942’s There’s One Born Every Minute, which was quickly followed by a star-making performance in 1944’s National Velvet. Elizabeth won two Academy Awards: one for her performance as a conflicted New York call girl in 1960’s Butterfield 8 and one for her performance opposite Richard Burton as the vituperative but vulnerable Martha in 1966’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The Hollywood legend’s personal life was also one of intrigue, as she had a total of eight husbands, including hotel heir Nicky Hilton, Cleopatra co-star Richard, producer Michael Todd, singer Eddie Fisher, and U.S. Senator John Warner.
