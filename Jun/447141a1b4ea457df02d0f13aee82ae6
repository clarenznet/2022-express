After much anticipation, Wimbledon began yesterday and it did not disappoint as British favourites Andy Murray and Emma Raducanu both ensured their safe passage through to the second round. Defending champion Novak Djokovic also came through a tricky four-set match to open proceedings on centre court. On day two, some of yesterday’s suspended matches will continue, while more big names are in action, including two of the greatest of all time.  Centre Court's matches will commence with world number one Iga Swiatek, who was chosen to begin Tuesday's proceedings after 2021 champion Ash Barty retired. She will face Jana Fett who has the daunting task of trying to hand the Pole her first defeat since February. Swiatek, who bids for her first title at the All-England Club, will walk on to centre court at 1.30pm. Following her will be 22-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal, who will play at Wimbledon for the first time since 2019. The 2008 and 2010 champion will commence his campaign against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo, in what will be their first meeting, with the Spaniard hoping to claim another title to keep his hopes of the calendar Grand Slam alive. The day’s play on the main show court will be closed out by Serena Williams, who will play her first single’s match since retiring from her first round match of Wimbledon last year. The American returned to action in the women’s doubles alongside Ons Jabeur in Eastbourne, but their run was cut short after the Tunisian sustained an injury. The tennis legend’s quest for an eighth Wimbledon title begins against Frenchwoman Harmony Tan. Elsewhere, Nick Kyrgios will start his tournament against British player Paul Jubb, while compatriot Katie Swan will face Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk. Express Sport runs through the full Wimbledon order of play on Day Two.
