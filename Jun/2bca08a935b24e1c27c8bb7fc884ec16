Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is designed to provide help with extra living costs to people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability. Their disability therefore could have an effect on them doing certain everyday tasks or getting around. The official figures issued by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show 35 percent of those claiming receive the highest award of £627 a month. With over 500 conditions that apply, Britons are encouraged to check if they too can receive this cash boost. As the cost of living continues, and inflation sits at nine percent, any extra cash could be vital for families on low incomes feeling the financial squeeze. To be eligible for PIP, people must have a health condition or disability where they have had difficulties with daily living or getting around (or both) for three months.

According to the figures, three million people are now receiving financial support of between £24.45 and £156.90 each week and as the benefit is paid every four weeks, this amounts to between £97.80 and £627.60 every payment period. Being eligible to apply for the award doesn't mean that one is guaranteed to receive it, the application has to be assessed against specific criteria.
