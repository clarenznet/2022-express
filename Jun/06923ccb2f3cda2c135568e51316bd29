Mick Lynch’s National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) will walk out on three days from tomorrow, with the chaos caused by striking rail staff set to affect millions across the country. Now, however, teachers and post workers have also threatened to join them in fresh warnings.  According to Birmingham Live, the National Education Union’s Mary Bousted said: "The case for a better deal for teachers will be set out in full this Wednesday in our letter to the Secretary of State. "If it should fall on deaf ears, and teachers are offered a pay rise significantly below inflation, we will proceed to an indicative ballot of members. Teachers have had enough of a government which simply does not value them." But Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party, Oliver Dowden, said: "The unions’ plan to bring Britain to a standstill by holding strikes across swathes of the economy and our public services is deeply selfish. "Hard-pressed families and businesses will suffer extra cost and disruption caused by these unnecessary strikes." National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) and the National Education Union (NEU) have vowed to ballot members. Unison, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing are considering action too.  A Rail Delivery Group spokesperson said: "We are acutely aware of the cost-of-living pressures being felt by workers and families across the UK. "Every business wants to support their staff and the railway is no exception. But, as an industry we have to change our ways of working and improve productivity to help pay our own way - the alternatives of asking taxpayers to shoulder the burden or passengers to pay higher fares when they too are feeling the pinch simply isn't fair." Boris Johnson had urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to condemn the planned rail strikes last week. But the 59-year-old Leader of the Opposition supports walkout strikes.
