The Trainspotting writer told Sir Keir Starmer to “get f*****” after the Labour leader said it was Britons’ “patriotic duty” to revel in the Queen’s 70-year reign. He also directed his anger at Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, for announcing the Government had extended pub hours over the Jubilee weekend.  The Queen and working members of the royal family will today (Thursday) begin the celebrations, including a Trooping of the Colour past Buckingham Palace. Millions of people across the country will be taking part in street parties and other celebrations of the longest-serving monarch in the nation’s history. However, while some might just be making use of the bumper bank holiday weekend, others have said they will be actively avoiding the commemorations. The Union Jack bunting has proved to be too much for some Scottish Nationalists who would rather be miserable than majestically merry.

Writing in the Telegraph yesterday (Wednesday), Sir Keir commented: “Just as at the Queen’s coronation in 1953, our country is at a crossroads. Just as then, we have gone through great change. “And just as then, there are siren voices who claim that our best days are behind us. But they will once again be proven wrong.” The opposition leader added: “We are a better, brighter country because of her. Our history is richer, our future built on firmer foundations and our great country made greater still by her rule.” Responding to his remarks, Mr Welsh told Sir Keir to “get f***** you ridiculous clown”. On Monday, Ms Patel announced that pubs and bars would be allowed to remain open until 1am over the next few days “as we come together to raise a glass to toast Her Majesty’s incredible service to our country”. The Home Secretary added: “Long may she reign!” Mr Welsh replied: “Nothing worse than boring c*** telling you to get p***** as a tribute to other boring c*****.” DON'T MISS:Trooping the Colour flypast live stream: How to watch the Red Arrows [EXPLAINER]RAF flypast for Jubilee: When and where to see the Red Arrows [INSIGHT]RAF pilot outlines exact minute RAF Flypast will be over Palace [ANALYSIS] He also retweeted another response to Ms Patel, inviting others to join “Dry Jubilee”, a 24-hour break from alcohol “to mark our absolute contempt for this nonsense”. In time for the Platinum Jubilee, last night Buckingham Palace announced well over a thousand honours, with a record number going to women. Included on the list was Ian Rankin, who received a knighthood for services to literature and charity, as well as Scottish businessmen James Walker, of Walker Shortbread, and Jimmy Milne, of the Balmoral Group. Asked if he was keeping his knighthood quiet, Mr Welsh jocularly said: “Holding out for a peerage or bust.” Mr Welsh is not the only Scottish Nationalist to take exception to the national pride; in a bitter rant for pro-independence newspaper The National, author Gerry Hassan said the Jubilee was a story of something “much more dark, sinister and damaging” than 70 years of uninterrupted rule. He wrote: “The Queen might be seen by many as having some admirable personal qualities but her role is increasingly anachronistic and indefensible and the institution which she fronts even more so. “It invites hyperbole and deception as its defence.” Mr Hassan, who has written several books on Scottish and British history, claimed Scotland’s monarchs “did not […] have the absolute power that was claimed in England”. Instead, “they were the monarch of the people and of the community of the realm”. While Scottish monarchs were previously titled King or Queen of the Scots, not Scotland, it was England’s first Scottish king, James I, who dropped the title in favour of King of Great Britain and Ireland.
