The Duchess of Cambridge opted for a white ensemble for this year's Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Kate arrived with the Duchess of Cornwall and her three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, wearing a white coatdress. It is believed the dress is an Alexander McQueen design. The Duchess of Cambridge combined it with a black and navy hat by designer Philip Treacey. However, this is not the first time Kate wears the white dress as she was first spotted donning the design last June at a reception in Cornwall.
