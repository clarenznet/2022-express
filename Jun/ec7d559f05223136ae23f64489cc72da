Carol Hodgson, 39, pleaded guilty to the charge today in court and was remanded in custody. Police were called to the address in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, after a "report of concern" was made about Daniel, Hodgson's young son. The toddler was rushed to hospital but died of his injuries. Hodgson was arrested two days later and charged with murder, reports Teesside Live. It was only confirmed today that the victim was her own child. Hodgson will appear back at Teesside Crown Court on July 15 for sentencing. No details about the offence were discussed during the 10-minute hearing. Police have, though, released a custodial photograph of Hodgson and a picture of little Daniel. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Matt Hollingsworth, of Cleveland Police, said: "Today our thoughts are with Daniel’s family. The loss of Daniel, at such a young age, is beyond comprehension. "I’d like to thank all the team who have worked on this harrowing investigation and ensured that we could bring this matter to court. "In response to a robust case against her, Carol Hodgson has now pleaded guilty to Daniel’s murder and we sincerely hope that those who knew Daniel find some measure of comfort in this, at what must remain a very difficult time for them." The death of little Daniel sent shockwaves through the community, with locals holding a vigil and laying floral tributes near the family home. Christopher Atkinson, head of the Crown Court Unit at Crown Prosecution Service North East, said: "Over the course of this case the Crown Prosecution Service has worked closely with our colleagues in Cleveland Police. "Through the comprehensive evidence that they have provided, the Crown Prosecution Service has been able to clearly establish the tragic sequence of events which culminated in Daniel’s death."
