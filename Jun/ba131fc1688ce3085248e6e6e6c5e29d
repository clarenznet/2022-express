Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the UK, killing around 32,000 people each year. The injury usually results from years of cumulative vascular damage, which is highly treatable if caught early. In a new study, the majority of stroke patients were found to have at least one major risk factor that had not been diagnosed. The alarming findings showed that many of those who suffer from an ischaemic stroke, without any previously diagnosed risk factors, have been found to have an underlying condition in the majority of cases. A staggering 67.7 percent of stroke patients with no previously diagnosed risk factor had at least one major risk factor. The most common risk factor found was dyslipidemia, an imbalance of blood fats, such as high cholesterol, or raised levels of triglycerides. The discovery, presented at the European Academy of Neurology, was made during an analysis of health records from 4,354 stroke patients.

Magnesium-rich foods, including spinach, are also recommended to minimise the risk.

Not all forms of vegetables are optimal for stroke prevention. Pickled vegetables, for example, contain high volumes of salt and oil. Both high salt and high-fat diets are risk factors for stroke, as they directly affect blood pressure.
