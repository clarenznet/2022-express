Russell Kane told Express.co.uk he doesn’t believe cancel culture really exists, as comedians are allowed to be more offensive now than ever before. The Steph’s Packed Lunch star pointed out there is a huge variety of comics out there, and they are becoming more diverse. Express.co.uk asked Russell about how comedians say it is harder to make jokes now due to fear of offending people. The 46-year-old said this is simply “not true”. “I haven't done the maths, but if anyone can be a***d, look at the number of stand up comic tickets on tour on sale now, I am quite confident to gamble it's more than any time in history,” he said. “More comics, more voices, more stand up. Whatever you're into - if you're into stale pale male comedians, there's plenty of them. “If you're into female comedians, there's plenty of them. “You can be white or brown, you can be Hindu, Christian, gay, straight, amputee, cerebral palsy, every type of comic is on tour, saying whatever the f*** they want. “Who has been cancelled? The last person who got seriously attempted to be cancelled and bullied was my poor mate Seann Walsh, and that was nothing to do with stand up whatsoever,” he added. “It was because of a dance show which has got nothing to do with free speech and comedy. No one can ever name a comedian.” Seann sparked a huge backlash when he was pictured kissing his Strictly Come Dancing partner Katya Jones in 2018, when they were both in relationships. He apologised, but recently said his mental health had still not recovered from the online abuse he received over the incident. Russell continued: “People say, 'Oh, you can't say anything,' Who"? Who can't say anything? “When you go into a theatre, there is consent. You have said, 'I am going in here, a comedian could call me a c*** in the front row, and anything goes.'

I do not moderate anything I say as long as it doesn't break any British law. You have never been able to shout, 'Fire, everyone get out, there's a fire!’ “It's illegal to do that. Someone will get hurt. It's illegal to shout racist abuse that might incite violence. “You couldn't shout sexist abuse, you couldn't tell the men in the audience, 'Find someone tonight and sexually assault them'. “That's illegal, rightly so,” he said. “Unless it's illegal, unless I'm f***ing missing something, it's just a bunch of butthurt people that can't be a***d to write a good joke half the time.” Russell added: “Of course you can't go on BBC1 and say, 'Anyway, I did a**l with a prostitute,' of course you can't, you never have been able to. That hasn't changed. “If anything, if you went in a time machine to 30 years ago, you wouldn't be able to say b*****, s*** or f*** on any TV station, at any point. If anything, you can be more offensive, I just don't get it.” He also denied Piers Morgan’s claim to have been “cancelled” by Good Morning Britain - pointing out the TalkTV star is “more prominent” than ever since storming off the set of the ITV show in a row over Meghan Markle.
