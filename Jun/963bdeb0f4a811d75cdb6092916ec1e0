 Christine Lampard, 43, has taken to Instagram with pictures of herself partying in Ibiza alongside her husband Frank. The Loose Women presenter was dressed in a two-piece bikini which could be seen underneath a see-through lace dress.  The presenter could be seen on the picture-sharing site partying at a beach in Ibiza with a group of locals. She was dressed in a racy strapless boob tube bikini teamed with a black lace dress as she posed for some fun shots in the sun. Christine was pictured alongside a group of women dressed in traditional Spanish attire and jewellery as she smiled for the camera. Earlier this week, the star shared a picture with her other half Frank enjoying some drinks on the beach.
