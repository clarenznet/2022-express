Three men have been arrested following the disorder, which happened on a quiet residential road in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, on Saturday night. Stones were hurled and the windscreen of a car was damaged in the fracas, police said today. Two people suffered non life-threatening injuries, Staffordshire Live reports.   More than 16,000 street parties were held over the last five days as the nation celebrated the Queen’s 70-year reign. Councils approved "a huge number" of applications from residents eager to honour the monarch.  But some "killjoy" councils had warned Britons against hosting illegal street parties. One local authority had told residents not to place bunting in the streets between lampposts and electric poles over concerns the strings "could cause damage to our dustcarts, light poles and vehicles." Emergency services also said streets must have been readily accessible in the event of an emergency, with unauthorised parties potentially causing an obstruction to police, fire and ambulance units. Holding a “street meet” instead of a street party could see residents come together to celebrate the event without the need for road closures or any of the consequences faced by illegal parties.
