The stars hit Venice Beach in Los Angeles in fluorescent clothing and neon yellow rollerblades. Wolf Of Wall Street actress Margot, 31, grinned in her gaudy leotard while Ryan, 41, braved a jazzy gilet and matching cycling shorts. The get-ups, which even a hi-vis loving politician would balk at, will be seen on the big screen in July next year. The plot is a secret but the cast also includes Oscar-winning Brit Emerald Fennell, Bridgertonâ€™s Nicola Coughlan and Will Ferrell.
