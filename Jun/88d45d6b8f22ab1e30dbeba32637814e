The strain of MRSA, a type of bacteria, broke out in pig due to farming practices and has become the dominant type in livestock across the continent for the last 50 years. But researchers have warned humans can also catch the strain of MRSA, which experts fear is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics.  Known as CC398, the strain has maintained this antibiotic resistance over decades in livestock like pigs and other animals. And according to a new study, the strain can rapidly adapt to human hosts, and maintain its resistance to antibiotics at the same time. The researchers say this resistance may have been built up over time due to the high levels of antibiotics use in pig farms. Dr Gemma Murray, a lead author of the study, said: "Historically high levels of antibiotic use (on pig farms) may have led to the evolution of this highly antibiotic-resistant strain of MRSA." This comes after scientists last year warned that antibiotic resistance had become something of a "hidden pandemic" amid coronavirus last year, stressing that "another crisis" could unfold as restrictions get lifted. This is a breaking story. More to follow.
