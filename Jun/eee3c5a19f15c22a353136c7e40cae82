Queenie had ballooned to 2st 6lb (15.4kg) after her previous owner struggled to care for her – and could barely walk when a charity took her in a year ago. The nine-year-old lost 11lb (5kg) and now loves to swim in the sea. Kath Robbins – a volunteer with Hope Rescue of Llanharan, South Wales – gave hydrotherapy to restore the portly pet’s muscles. Slimline Queenie has been adopted by Kath’s mum Terry, who said: “Her dear little face looked so sad attached to that large body. Now it’s wonderful to see.”
