The Duchess was joined by her two eldest children in the Royal Box for the event. She wore a midi length elegant white dress. The Duchess was wearing a pleated satin white dress from Self-Portrait. It was belted and the chiffon midi skirt has a lace trim. The elegant dress features a pleated skirt. The top of the dress resembled a blazer and the jacket includes shoulder pads for structure. It cost £468 and is currently available in a couple of sizes on Net-a-Porter. She was seated with her two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte as well as her husband, the Duke of Cambridge. The Duchess looked relaxed and happy as she chatted with her children in the Royal Box at the start of the show. One person tweeted: “Kate Middleton is so beautiful.” Another said: “Kate Middleton looks stunning.” The Duchess has previously worn the elegant dress to an event at the National Portrait Gallery. Earlier today, she joined her husband and two eldest children for an official event in Wales. The Duchess also wore white for the Trooping the Colour event earlier this week as part of the celebrations.
