Amanda Holden, 51, stunned in orange as she sported an orange mini dress for today's radio show. The Britain's Got Talent judge worked the tight fitted mini dress, leaving her long, toned legs on full display. Amanda wore a white long-sleeved frilly blouse underneath, bringing an office-style look to her attire. She styled the outfit with stiletto heels, showcasing her enviable pins even more. The television personality couldn't resist posting her usual catwalk video in view of her 1.8 million Instagram followers. She captioned the video: "The future's bright... the future's [orange emoji]." Amanda is known for putting on a leggy display and yesterday was no different as she showed off her attire for the second live Britain's Got Talent. She stunned in a daring violet gown which was by designer Suzanne Neville. The singer put her perfectly tanned legs on full display thanks to the daring, thigh-high split on the side of the garment. Not wanting to risk her modesty, the gap was secured by two glitzy diamante bands at the top of her leg, protecting the star from a wardrobe malfunction.
