Johnny Depp, who previously collaborated with Jeff Beck on the 2020 track Isolation, will now perform in Gateshead, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and York. It comes after the Pirates of the Caribbean actor secured a victory against Amber Heard in his defamation trial. The 58-year-old actor sued his ex-wife for $50 million (Â£38 million) over a 2018 op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post, about being a survivor of domestic abuse. Yesterday saw the jurors in the Virginia courtroom award the Hollywood actor $15m which was later reduced by the judge to $10.35m. It has since been reported Amber will appeal the court's decision, according to the New York Times. The jurors found that Depp did not assault his ex-wife and that her allegations of domestic abuse in her op-ed defamed Depp "with malice". Meanwhile, the Hollywood A-lister appeared to be in high spirits as he was seen headed into the Sage venue ahead of his performance tonight. He waved to the crowd while being shielded by his security team. Depp sported a casual appearance in a black and white checked top which he teamed with black jeans. He accessorised his look with a pair of purple sunglasses to shield his eyes. Depp had previously surprised audiences and fans when he joined Beck on stage in Sheffield and at London's Royal Albert Hall earlier this week.
