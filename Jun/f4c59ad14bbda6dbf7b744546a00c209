Vladimir Andonov, 44, a fighter in the Wagner Group, was shot by the sniper near Kharkiv during a reconnaissance mission on June 5, according to Russian media. A hated figure across Ukraine, he made his reputation by carrying out massacres during Russia's first invasion of the country in 2014. Ukraine accuses him of personally participating in the massacre of prisoners of war in the town of Logvinovo in the aftermath of the major battle which took place in early 2015, and of killing civilians elsewhere in Donbas during this invasion. Wagner mercenaries have gained a bloodthirsty reputation for fighting battles that Russia's regular military cannot and it is thought that Andonov was sent to fight in Syria and Lybia before returning to Ukraine.
