The monarch’s disgraced second son stepped down from public life after the furore over his friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, and paid millions to settle a civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, a woman he claimed never to have met. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said last night: “After undertaking a routine test the Duke has tested positive for Covid and with regret will no longer be attending tomorrow’s service.” It is understood Andrew saw the Queen in the last few days but has been undertaking regular testing and has not seen her since he tested positive. He is the latest in a long line of royals to catch Covid including the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, theDuke of Cambridge and Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. Princess Michael of Kent suffered severe symptoms when she contracted it in November 2020.
