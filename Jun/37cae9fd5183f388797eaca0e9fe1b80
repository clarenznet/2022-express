The ex-footballer, who suffered racial abuse as a child, backed the Don't Face It Alone campaign and called for a new online platform free of "toxic behaviours". At Downing Street yesterday, he talked about the Diana Award's anti-hate scheme and backed the Online Safety Bill, designed to let Ofcom fine firms for failing to protect children on the internet. The dad of four, 43, said: "Passing the Bill will be a good start, making the social media platforms accountable for a lot of the hate." Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "Bullying can have a devastating, life-long impact on young people." Research by the Diana Award revealed that almost six in 10 parents feel powerless to protect their children online.
