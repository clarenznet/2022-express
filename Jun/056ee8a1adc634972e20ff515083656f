And 97 percent of the 1,285 surveyed believe the Government is not doing enough to help. Half are most worried about the soaring costs of energy bills while 99 percent want the basic state pension to be increased now to compensate for the suspension of the triple lock. Some 97 percent say the Government support package does not provide enough help. Dennis Reed from senior citizens group Silver Voices, behind the research, said: "Our poll gives a giant thumbs down to the current support package. "One-off payments go nowhere near meeting the scale of the inflation crisis and will be quickly gobbled up by surging prices. "The only answer is to ensure the state pension reflects the true rate of inflation. "The Government has to own up to its cruel mistake of suspending the triple lock and restore the basic pension to its rightful level."  A Government spokesman said: "Pensioner households will receive £300 to help them cover the rising cost of energy this winter, with those on Pension Credit getting a further £650." Legislation is also introduced today to give extra sums to eight million lowincome households. The first payment of £326 will be made from July 14, with a second in the autumn. At the same time, 850,000 households are missing out on Pension Credit, with £1.7billion being unclaimed, says the Department for Work and Pensions. It urged people to call 0800 99 1234.
