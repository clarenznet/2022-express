Nick Kyrgios’ latest Wimbledon outburst has once again split opinion on the controversial Australian. It took the 27-year-old just 12 minutes to lose his cool in his opening-round match against Britain’s Paul Jubb, taking issue with the actions of a line judge and complaining to the umpire. Kyrgios continued to show his frustrations, swearing at the umpire over noise during a rally and smashing a ball out of Court Three after Jubb claimed the first set 6-3. Yet the outspoken world No. 40 came back to win a thrilling contest in five sets, finally overcoming Jubb 3-6 6-1 7-5 6-7 7-5 to advance through to the next round.  Have your say on Kyrgios' behaviour in the comments below. Aside from losing his cool, Kyrgios played some scintillating tennis at times, wowing the crowd with a number of unconventional shots. Kyrgios, who is unseeded for the tournament despite coming into Wimbledon in good form, has long been one of the most controversial figures in tennis, known for his antics as much as his talent. Canberra-born Kyrgios has been the subject of criticism in the past from John McEnroe, despite the legendary US star having a similarly-fiery temperament on court.  Yet he has also won fans, such as three-time Wimbledon champion John Newcombe, who has praised Kyrgios’ individual and unique approach to the game. Whilst he may not be seeded for this tournament, Kyrgios’ natural flare may well lead many to fancy him as a dark horse that could cause some upsets in the men’s draw - but others argue that his hot-headedness means he will struggle to put together consistent enough performances to trouble the very best at Wimbledon. What are your thoughts on the 27-year-old? Is he good entertainment value, or does his temperament detract from his overall game? Have your say in the comments below.
