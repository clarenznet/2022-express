A total of 9,988 people have navigated the busy shipping lanes from France, according to analysis of Government data. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that 40 people were brought ashore on Friday in a single boat. A total of 28,526 people made the crossing in 2021, compared with 8,466 in 2020, 1,843 in 2019 and 299 in 2018. The figures come as it is revealed hundreds of failed asylum seekers who are kicked out of the country manage to return to make a second attempt to stay. In one case a failed asylum seeker sent back to Iraq managed to work their way back to the UK to lodge a second asylum claim that was then accepted - 17 years after their first application. Officials admit they had to deal with 1,684 "boomerang" asylum cases in the past three years. Figures from the Home Office show just 88 of those cases were successful, meaning the second asylum plea is turned down in 19 out of 20 cases. Successful cases include a refugee sent back to Kosovo in 2005. Almost 12 years later they arrived back in the UK to submit a second claim, which was accepted. The Home Office plans to use Rwanda in east Africa as a "processing centre" for would-be refugees who make it to the UK. The scheme has been criticised by Human Rights campaigners who claim it is both immoral and unworkable. Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch UK, said: "Asylum seekers keep coming back because they've nothing to lose and every chance of succeeding. "Such is the ease with which our overwhelmed asylum system can be abused - to the detriment of genuine refugees and the poor old UK taxpayer." The Home Office said: "Under our world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda, a fundamentally safe and secure country, illegal migrants will be relocated to have their claims for asylum considered, helping to break the people-trafficking business."
