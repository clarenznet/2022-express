Princess Eugenie, 32, made her second appearance of the day by opening Horatio’s Garden at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. The royal also planted a tree for the Queen’s Green Canopy during her visit. She wore a recycled look with her Palmer/Harding 'April' shirt dress.  The description on the website said: “Palmer/Harding's navy April dress showcases the label's signature sculptural silhouettes. “It's crafted from cotton-blend seersucker with a round neck and elbow-length sleeves finished with turned-up flared cuffs. “It features extended panels at the shoulders and placket seams, while the gathered waistband accentuates the feminine shape. “Pair it with a basket bag and mules for a chic city ensemble.”  This dress was last worn by the Princess in 2018 for the Queen’s Garden Party. Due to its popularity, it is currently sold out. Therefore, its price is unknown. Eugenie paired the dress with her Jimmy Choo "Romy" pumps in navy. They cost a whopping £550. The description on the website reads: “The classic pump is subtly updated with a softer pointed toe and modern stiletto heel, by way of our ROMY style. “This navy suede pair is appealingly versatile, with a leather lining and sole that ensures a durable wear. “Let them lend a note of sophistication to any look you choose.” Eugenie posted the photographs of herself at the hospital, planting a tree on her Instagram. Royal fans took to the comments underneath to praise the Princess’s style. Instagram user @mariavap_vap said: “You have your personal style and I love it.” Another fan, @cazcook1302 added: “Gorgeous young woman.”
