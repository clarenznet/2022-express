Anyone visiting a gas station to fill up in recent months will doubtless have been struck by how rapidly they can spend £20, £30 or even £50 - and such perceptions are borne out by statistics compiled by the RAC Foundation.  On June 23, 2021, the cost of unleaded petrol was 131.3 pence per litre, while diesel was slightly more expensive, at 133.6 pence per litre. On June 24, 2022, the prices were 190.2 pence, and 198.5 pence respectively - in other words, a rise of almost 31 percent for petrol and 31.5 percent for diesel. Since June 26, 2020, the cost of petrol - which then stood at 109.5 pence per litre and diesel (113.9 pence per litre) are both up by more than 42 percent.
