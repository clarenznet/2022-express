Olga Lautman, Senior Fellow Center for European Policy Analysis, said the West must act now to ensure an "emboldened" Putin does not succeed in his bloodthirsty mission. She told the Sun: “Russia’s appetite won’t stop. We’ve seen it and we’ve seen that negotiations with them don’t work. Their word is worth nothing, their promises are worth nothing and I think that in this case, they need to be contained because if they are not, the threat they will pose will be far greater than Ukraine." Ms Lautman's chilling warning comes as a Russian politician presents a draft bill that would revoke the recognition of Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1991. If a majority of Russian MPs vote in favour, Russia will no longer recognise that Lithuania left the Soviet Union in a legal way. Ms Lautman added: “If you ignore or try to negotiate, the negotiations in Russia’s mind are only how to seek weaknesses from their opponents, so they can use them as pressure points.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
