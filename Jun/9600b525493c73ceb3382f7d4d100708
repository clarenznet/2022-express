Charles Leclerc starts on pole for the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix ahead of the Red Bull duo Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen. The Ferrari driver fronts the grid for the fourth successive race start but has failed to win any of the last three races before this; a run he will desperately hope to end here. Victory would see him narrow the nine-point gap to championship leader Verstappen. Leclerc does not currently have the benefit of tactical support from Carlos Sainz who is down in P4, unless the Spaniard can get off to a good start and wedge himself between the two Red Bulls. Mercedes are meanwhile are well off the pace outside the Ferrari-Red Bull battle with fifth-placed George Russell over a second slower than Leclerc in qualifying. Lewis Hamilton starts P7 after no further action was taken by stewards following an investigation into an incident with the McLaren of Lando Norris. But the seven-time world champion was over a second-and-a-half behind pole-sitter Leclerc with the Silver Arrows, who are struggling with porpoising on the long straights of the Baku street circuit, relying on mistakes or misfortune ahead of them to be able to fight for a podium. And so the focus will mainly be on the battle between Drivers' Championship and Constructors' Championship protagonists Red Bull and Ferrari, with the latter top of both standings as they seek a first double title triumph since 2013. Verstappen's team-mate Perez has very much entered the driver's title fray after winning in Monaco last time out and he out-qualified the Dutchman on Saturday to start P2 here. He goes into today's race just six points behind Leclerc and 15 off of Verstappen. Express Sport provides live lap-by-lap updates of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix below.
