Judith Hamilton, 53, was said to have put patients at risk drinking two days prior to going to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London, where she was a consultant gynaecologist, a disciplinary panel heard.

She was suspended by the Medical Practitioners Council for three months but it did not warrant depriving the public of "an otherwise clinically competent doctor".
