Scammers are taking advantage of the council tax rebate scheme continues, with some unsure of when they will receive their dues. Reports have shown people being contacted by fraudsters impersonating local councils to try get their bank information.  Dover District Council shared a warning about the nine different scams involving impersonation of the council that they have been made aware of. Residents have been contacted through telephone calls by people claiming to be from the council trying to arrange their £150 rebate. Dover District Council noted: “We will not be calling residents over the phone to take payment or bank details, nor will we ask you for any other personal information over the telephone about this.”        Dover has not been the only council affected by this scam, regarding council tax band assessments. Fraudsters contact residents via email, text or phone to offer a council tax refund or arrange a council tax band reassessment. Dover District Council warned residents should not give out personal or banking information.  They advised: “Delete any emails or texts straight away and block the sender; do not reply or click on any links. If you receive a phone call, end the call as quickly as possible.” South Hams District Council also warned residents to be on their guard against this scam. They explained: “Once the resident has provided bank details, they are given another number to call which informs them that they need to pay an administration fee to get the refund. “The Council would never ring a resident to ask for their bank details to issue a refund. If an overpayment had been made, and a refund is due, we would either refund the money directly if it had been paid by direct debit, or send a credit notice to the bill payer's address.”     Similarly there are scammers making phone calls or sending texts or emails stating one’s property is in the wrong council tax band and offering a reassessment or refund for a fee. It is usually suggested that people who are suspicious of a correspondence they have received contact the organisation on a number they trust to check if it is legitimate. Britons have been contacted by scammers saying they are in arrears with their council tax. This is a common tactic amongst fraudsters as it instils fear and a sense of urgency.  Usually, this will see victims acting irrationally and not making as many sensible choices and checks that they usually would. The scammers then ask for the victims’ bank or card information in order to make the payment that has been left unpaid. Dover District Council warned: “If you are in arrears with your Council Tax, will we write to you in the first instance.” Britons who receive a suspicious phone calls like this that try rush them into making decisions should hang up and call a reputable number for the organisation they are dealing with to ensure the issue is legitimate.
