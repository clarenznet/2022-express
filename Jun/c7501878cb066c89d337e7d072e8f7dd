An army of volunteers spent all day clearing abandoned tents, packaging and beer cans at the site in Somerset. More than 200,000 people attended the five-day festival, featuring musicians such as Diana Ross, Sir Paul McCartney, and Billie Eilish. The last revellers exited yesterday, leaving behind the mountains of waste across the site. Tractors pulling huge trailers were used to remove rubbish bags from some 15,000 bins. Seagulls took advantage of the mess to pick up the last scraps of food from the litter. The Glasto Recycling Team is made up of hundreds of volunteers who work alongside charities to help raise money for cleaning up. Despite the immense task, rapid progress was made â€“ with the area around the pyramid stage left pristine by mid-afternoon. Eco experts claim up to 2,000 tons of waste was left there this year with an increase in the number of discarded tents. Festival organisers sought to mitigate the damage to the environment by installing solar panels, planting trees and providing bin bags to the fans.
