A fan watching Emma Raducanu in her second-round match against Caroline Garcia was taken out of the court momentarily by stewards after being told to calm down several times. Raducanu faced a tough test in her second match at this year's Championship with Garcia a two-time doubles Grand Slam champion.  The French tennis ace also came into this year's tournament in excellent form and had plenty of practice on the grasscourts. Garcia played in three events and won the Bad Homburg Open where she defeated Bianca Andreescu in the final. In contrast, Raducanu came into the tournament with serious doubts on her fitness. But she put those injury concerns behind her with a strong win over Belgian Alison Van Uytvanck in the first round. Garcia was to be a tougher test though and that proved to be the case in the opening set. The crowd inside Centre Court were raisig the noise in the second to try and inspire a fightback for Raducanu.  But one male fan appeared to go one step too far on several occasions for the security. He regularly stood up to cheer Raducanu on whenever the Brit won a point. After being admonished four times, it appears as though he was taken out of Centre Court by security. He returned shortly after and appeared to settle down in his seat for the remainder of the match.  Raducanu certainly needed the support in the second set though as she was struggling to cope with the low ground strokes from Garcia. The US Open champion regularly had to bend down to the ground to return her shots and several went back into the net. Raducanu lost serve at the start of the second, but played the perfect follow up game to break back. Garcia still appeared to control most of the match though and eventually broke again. Raducanu then ran out of ideas on how to get back into the match with Garcia hitting a strong winner to progress to the third round.
