It means Terence Burke can bring a case of disability discrimination against his former employer, the Turning Point Scotland charity, which sacked him last August. An employment tribunal hearing was told yesterday that Covid had left him with "substantial and long-term" side effects. He was signed off sick for nine months as he struggled to complete simple chores or walk a short distance to buy a newspaper. His daughter Tressa Burke, from Glasgow, said her dad was "fatigued for months," had no appetite and lost weight. He will now bring claims of unfair dismissal, disability discrimination, age discrimination and failure to pay redundancy payments to a final tribunal hearing.
