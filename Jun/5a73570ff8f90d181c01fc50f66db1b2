Carol Vorderman sparked a frenzy on Instagram after sharing a series of snaps from her day yesterday. The Countdown icon, 61, stunned as she wore a navy dress while recording the pilot episode of a new podcast series. The mother of two stunned as she wore her freshly blonde hair in neat curls down her chest as she smiled for the pics Carol captioned the snaps: "Lovely afternoon making a great pilot (well I think so anyway) for a podcast... I think coming soon... it's a cracker of a series... you'll love it. "Hot tho in Hampton Court so we went for a little boating past the Palace... Happy days. Get those fans out for tomorrow," (sic) she advised her 225,000 followers. Many of the star's fans took to the pics to leave heart eye emojis, but Instagram user neilj66 mused at the strength of the embellishments on Carol's outfit. "Some super strong buttons there," they penned.
