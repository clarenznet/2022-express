Lauren Whittington could not believe her eyes when the Hollywood actor showed up at the Bridge Tavern pub in Newcastle. The pub was packed full of people when she spotted Mr Depp hanging out with fellow musicians Sam Fender and Jeff Beck. After taking photos with the actor, Lauren was all ears as Depp dished out parenting advice when he realised she was pregnant. Lauren said: "None of us could believe it, he went unnoticed for maybe an hour before anyone realised it was him and Jeff Beck just sat eating Fish and Chips together in the corner. "His security came over and asked if there was any way we could get Sam Fender in without people ambushing him, so we shut off our upstairs terrace for them to go up there, they were really grateful and stayed for a couple of hours, with Sam staying long after Johnny and Jeff left. "He noticed I’m pregnant and was asking me how long I have left, then he was giving me some advice on nappies, lack of sleep, and the first few weeks of parenthood, saying it’ll be the greatest gift I ever receive and I won’t know love like it until I look into her eyes for the first time. "He was also talking about his kids, who are grown up now, and how magical being a parent is." Depp's surprise appearance at the pub came just one hour before it was revealed that he had won his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. Lauren added: "He left about an hour before the verdict and said he had a zoom call about it, so we wished him luck and thanked him for being so kind, and he thanked us for having him."
