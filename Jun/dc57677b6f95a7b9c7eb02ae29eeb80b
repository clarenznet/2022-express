  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss quickly and correctly said: "I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine. They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy. "And Robert Jenrick accurately summed-up the mood saying: "This disgusting Soviet-era era show trial is the latest reminder of the depravity of Putinâ€™s regime."The Russian Ambassador should be summoned to the Foreign Office to account for this egregious breach of the Geneva Convention. No one should think they can treat British citizens like this and get away with it."We can only hope that other Russian ambassadors are in Donetsk reminding the separatist rabble they take orders from Moscow.
