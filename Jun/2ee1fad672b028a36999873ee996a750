With the number of over-85s set to treble by 2066, many Britons will be weighing up where they should settle down and enjoy their twilight years. Researchers at home security group Taking Care have compiled a list of the best UK towns and cities for people aged 65 and over. Each location was given two ratings out of 100, one for its overall merits as a place to live as a pensioner and the other specifically for elderly care. The study, shared exclusively with Express.co.uk, compared factors including house prices, the cost and quality of care homes, and ambulance waiting times. Areas were also rated for popular amenities such as the number of green spaces, bingo halls and fish and chip shops. Llandudno in Wales was rated the best place to retire, at 52.8 overall, with average low house prices of £230,888 and annual care home costs of £38,948.
