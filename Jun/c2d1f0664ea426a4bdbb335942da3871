Emergency services were called to Hatton Garden shortly before 2pm today [June 8] to reports of the blaze.  A short time later, police and fire crews cordoned off the road and began directing people from the area.  There are currently eight fire engines, multiple police cars and an incident response ambulance at the scene, reports Liverpool Echo. The fire broke out in one of the rooms at The Richmond hotel, according to a guest who told reporters they had to be evacuated.  Other guests who were evacuated said they came out to see smoke billowing from a window, and that the evacuation was handled calmly.
