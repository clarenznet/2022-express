Last week, the European Union launched two separate legal proceedings against the UK after it published plans to unilaterally scrap parts of the Protocol, such as the need for checks on goods coming from Britain to Northern Ireland.

There are certain areas where we can improve the protocol and we should continue to do that.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
