Nicola Sturgeon is facing the first session of First Minister's Questions since the SNP announced it would be holding a second independence referendum in 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asked Ms Sturgeon if she accepts that "frontline officers don't believe policing is a priority for you and your government" and quoted a statement from the Chief Constable of Police Scotland which said: "The Scottish Government has clearly set out its spending priorities - policing is not one of them." Ms Sturgeon said she takes the views of frontline police officers "very seriously indeed" but she suggested the picture painted by Mr Ross was not an accurate one. She told Holyrood policing conditions and pay were better in Scotland than in England. Mr Ross replied: "The First Minister must be on a different planet!" He pointed out that the Scottish policing federation released a statement this morning saying their members would be taking the most "overt demonstration of action in more than 100 years".
