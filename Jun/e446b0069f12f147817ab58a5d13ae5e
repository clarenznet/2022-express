Steve Barclay, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and No10 chief of staff, is on a mission to make the UK the “best place in the world to be a veteran”. The seven-figure sum will fund a website that from next year will allow simple digital verification of a veteran’s status. It will make it easier to get fast-track mental health appointments plus other government and charity services.  The Government also confirmed that all Whitehall departments now guarantee a job interview for veterans. Around 800 men and women have already secured employment offers through the programme. That includes a number of prison officer roles under the “advance into justice” scheme. Mr Barclay added: “We are investing in a new digital identification service.  “This will enable services and our charity sector to better identify and prioritise our veterans. Coming on top of Operation Courage, the more than £18million investment to get veterans access to better mental healthcare, the service will give the capability to identify veterans and get help more quickly to those who need targeted support in health, housing or employment.” The Government said “great progress” has been achieved towards meeting the commitments it made in January as part of its veterans strategy action plan. A fifth of 60 pledges have now been met. Military events will be held throughout Armed Forces Week culminating in Armed Forces Day on Saturday held in Scarborough, N Yorks. Flag raising ceremonies involving the Royal Navy, Army, and Royal Air Force will be held on Monday.
