 Katya Jones looked stunning in a mirror selfie taken at the gym today. The Strictly Come Dancing star showed off her toned physique in a sports bra and leggings. She posted a boomerang in view of her 206k followers, holding up her long ponytail as she stood in front of the mirror. Tagging Barry’s bootcamp in the post, Katya wrote: “I promise I’m not a regular.” Katya stunned in the pink leopard print set and black trainers - looking amazingly put together despite her sweaty activities. The star has recently been regaling her fans with beautiful photos of her sun-soaked holiday.
