Christina Aguilera recreated her famous leather chaps look from the 2002 hit video 'Dirrty', this time in sparkling patent red, paired with a matching harnessed bodysuit. As she switched from one jaw-dropping costume to another, fans also caught sight of her in a green Hulk-inspired bodysuit, which she paired with a phallic strap-on to cheers from the crowd. She also donned a sequin striped bodysuit in bright rainbow colours to honour the cause of the festival - LGBT rights. In a further costume change, the singer channelled Madonna as she donned a pink latex bodysuit with matching conical bra details. She also took part in a mini onstage reunion of the stars from the 2001 track Lady Marmalade, wowing in a neon yellow feather outfit next to her former co-star Mya. The event, held in Los Angeles, reminded the world why they couldn't keep their eyes off Christina at the height of her career, and offered the promise of more outrageous outfits, and perhaps new music, to come.
