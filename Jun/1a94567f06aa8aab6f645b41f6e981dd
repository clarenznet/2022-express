Her Majesty, 96, has been spotted several times in the saddle in Windsor Castle's grounds, including this week. She was advised to quit nine months ago when mobility problems limited her ability to get around. Yesterday aides said she was taking it gently and hopes to continue if it is not too painful. A source at Windsor said: "She has enjoyed being on her horse again." The monarch has been a keen horsewoman since getting her first pony at the age of three in 1929. The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell touched on her love of riding at the Platinum Jubilee thanksÂ­ giving service when he said: "We are so glad you are still in the saddle and we are all glad there is still more to come. So thank you for staying the course." Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the Queen's decision to ride again. She is expected to travel to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, her official residence in Edinburgh, next week.
