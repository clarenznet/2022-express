Amber Melville-Brown, a reputation and media lawyer with Withersworldwide, claimed that Ms Giuffre could sit down with famous chat show hosts, such as Oprah Winfrey. Speaking to the Sun, she said: "It is not impossible that Ms Giuffre will find herself on the chat-show sofa". She said that Oprah Winfrey's show has "played host to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as they sat down very publicly to spill some private royal family beans in cosy tete-a-tetes with the chat show queens and their millions of viewers. Ironic if the next indentation in the sofa is made by Ms Giuffre, who is standing up for herself and others as the settlement statement says, has made such a lasting indentation in the reputation of Harryâ€™s uncle Andrew." Prince Andrew settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him by Ms Giuffre out of court earlier this year. The 61-year-old royal has repeatedly and vehemently denied the allegations. The settlement made no admission of guilt. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
