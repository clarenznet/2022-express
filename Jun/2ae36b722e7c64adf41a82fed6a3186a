It was the second day in a row that the 96-year-old monarch, who has suffered for several months with mobility problems, was able to stand without a walking stick. She met with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, on Tuesday. Yesterday, she wore a summery bright yellow dress with a blue floral pattern to greet the Governor of New South Wales. The Queen is monarch of Australia and Ms Beazley is her representative in NSW.
