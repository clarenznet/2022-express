Nick, who did not wish to give his full name, claims he enquired about a 14-person booking at FireFly, for a meal in July. However, he alleges he received an automated booking policy email back – stating groups over six ‘must be all female or a mixed group’. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Nick says he had dined at the One New Bailey restaurant previously and wanted to see if there was any availability for his birthday. However, his booking was for a party of just men. He has now labelled the policy "blatant sexism" and has vowed to never return to the restaurant. "As a gay man I have lots of gay friends who I go out with for big birthday celebrations," he explained. "Parties of six having to be just female or mixed is blatant sexism to me. “I completely understand why they might want to do that, to stop a big group of lads causing trouble. But if you’re going to attract those types of people you need to be able to deal with it – have security on for a reason.   “I actually went for a meal there on Friday with my friends. I’ve been there before and really enjoyed it so I was going to see if there was any availability for my birthday which is next month. “I just feel like they’re discriminating against half the population. It doesn’t make sense. The annoying thing is, I would have said it was my favourite restaurant. I loved the vibe – I would never go back.”  The Manchester Evening News has contacted FireFly for comment but has not yet received a response.
