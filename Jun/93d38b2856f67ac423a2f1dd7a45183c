And Kate got behind the camera to record the occasion, before meeting young wellwishers. The 12ft monument shows a man, woman and child standing on top of suitcases and honours those who travelled from the Caribbean in answer to a plea to help rebuild post-war Britain. William spoke of the Windrush scandal, which began in 2017 after it emerged that hundreds of Commonwealth citizens, many from the Windrush generation, had been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. He said: “They were victims of racism when they arrived here, and discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for black men and women in Britain in 2022. “Only a matter of years ago, tens of thousands of that generation were profoundly wronged by the Windrush scandal. That rightly reverberates throughout the Caribbean community here in the UK as well as many in the Caribbean nations." In his speech to those who had gathered for the unveiling, which included Windrush travellers and their families, William added: “We know without question that the Windrush generation have made our culture richer, our services stronger and our fellow countrymen safer.” The Queen also paid tribute to the “profound contribution” made to the UK. The artwork is by Jamaican sculptor Basil Watson and depicts the three figures dressed in their “Sunday best”.
