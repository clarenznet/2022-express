White House sources last night said the option was being carefully considered - despite Russian warnings that it would see any such delivery of heavy weapons as a "provocative escalation". Ukrainian defence adviser Yuriy Sak said his country's army had already received some heavy weaponry from the West, but needed more. "The most pressing need at the moment is the so-called multi-launch rocket systems, the MLRS, because they have a longer fire range than what we have at the moment and they will allow us to redress the imbalance in artillery in the east. And of course this will be a game changer," he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly appealed for the MLRS to counter Russia's Donbas offensive. Kyiv's forces are currently using US M777 howitzers, with a range of about 16 miles. But an M270 MLRS battery can fire rockets at targets up to 186 miles away, as can a similar US system, M142 Himars. It is through they would greatly boost the Ukrainians' capabilities - even enabling them to hit targets inside Russia, though such action would risk drawing Nato into direct conflict with Russia. And a senior US official quoted by the Washington Post said the White House was now comfortable with giving Ukraine the MLRS, but would withhold the longest range rockets.
