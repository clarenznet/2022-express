Tweedy the Clown enters as "Tweedy Gonzales" and joins forces with Mexican comedic performer Adriana Duch Carvallo who channels Frida Kahlo with outrageous make-up and a perma-smile that lights up the tent. Acts old and new include the tirelessly acrobatic Havana Circus Company who catapult each other into the air with vertiginous skill, a brace of female aerialists held aloft by their hair, and a white-knuckle knife-throwing act. These are circus acts with proper acting, clowns that are actually funny, and a band that can play almost any type of music. All wrapped up in an authentic village circus created by a family for families. What's not to love? Chiswick House & Gardens until June 27, UK tour until September 19. Tickets: 01453 800200
