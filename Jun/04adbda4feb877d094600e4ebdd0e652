Amanda Holden, 51, stunned as the beauty stepped out for Britain's Got Talent in a gorgeous dress that was covered in emerald gems. The beauty revealed her outfit for the third live show of the series, which featured a low-cut design showing off her ample assets. The actress posed and twirled for the camera as she showed off the dazzling dress, which was made up of crystals on sheer lace. Amanda looked gorgeous in the floor length gown, which featured a low-cut back and a plunging front, which gave a glimpse of her cleavage with three jewelled straps. The BGT judge completed her look with a very glamorous palette of make-up, which she showed off in a close-up shot of her face. She scooped her blonde tresses into a high ponytail which put her stunning features on full display. In view of her 1.8 million followers, she captioned the post: "@bgt Live Show 3." While social media users gushed over her appearance, others shared their criticism of her look. Twitter user, Stuart wrote: "It's time Amanda dressed her age." David uttered: "How very sad. If that is to do with fashion why don't you recognise the absurdity of it? Do buck up." Jan fumed: "Tone it down a little," while Billy remarked: "Always having to show way too much skin than needed." Graham scathed: "Not suitable for a family program, but it will do." However, others were less critical, as they gushed over Amanda's appearance. Chris penned: "Like fine wine. You just get better with age #perfect lady." Martyn gushed: "You look stunning," while Bohan added: "Shine bright like a diamond."
