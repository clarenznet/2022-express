The incident took place near the quarry at Isle of Wight lane in Dunstable. Eyewitness Graham Cunstance said the incident "initially looked like a field fire but then an explosion was heard". He said that at least three fire crews are in attendance.  Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue told Express.co.uk that the smoke was the result of a dump truck fire, which occurred earlier today. Firefighters from both Dunstable and Hertfordshire have been called out. As of 6.30pm, they were still working to extinguish the flames. They are using breathing apparatus and a water carrier from Toddington to extinguish the blaze.  Another resident, Penny, who lives on the other side of quarry, said she could hear the explosion from her garden. The 35-tonne dump truck caught fire at Kensworth Quarry. A spokesperson for the force told Heart News that firefighters from "Dunstable and Hertfordshire are working to extinguish the flames using breathing apparatus and a water carrier from Toddington". Kensworth Quarry is a working chalk extraction site, located on private land. But there is a public footpath around the area, which attracts visitors as a result of the turquoise water and chalk islands. Just two months ago, a major fire took place at a nearby warehouse in Dunstable. The fire, which took place on April 27, began in the roof of a commercial bakery on Woodside Industrial Estate. Fire services from Dunstable Fire Station were called out to the scene at around 2.55pm. No one was injured, but the roof of the building suffered major damage.
