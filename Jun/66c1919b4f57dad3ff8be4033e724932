The Duchess of Sussex recently sent a letter of support to members of the Moms Demand Action group. Meghan's letter, which shows her support for enforcing stricter gun controls in the US, comes after her visit to Robb Elementary - where the school shooting happened in May. The group was formed by activist Shannon Watts following the Sandy Hook school shooting which happened 10 years ago when Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people. In the Duchess' letter, she described Ms Watts as a "fearless leader" and offered "a huge thank you for the work you are doing to keep our kids, families, and communities safe".
