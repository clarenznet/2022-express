Thousands of members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union at Network Rail and 13 train operators will walk out on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in the biggest outbreak of industrial action on the railways for a generation. The Transport Secretary accused RMT union boss Mick Lynch of "holding a gun to his own industry's head" in an act of "reckless vandalism" that has ground the country to a halt. Speaking to the Telegraph, Mr Shapps said: "Every hour of strikes will surely increase the enthusiasm from the travelling public to have their trains automated to get rid of this threat over their heads that the workers will strike. I think these strikes are severely counterproductive, not just for people who can’t get to their exams this week and to hospital appointments but also fundamentally to railway workers who will find in the end that automation just becomes more attractive than striking employees.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
