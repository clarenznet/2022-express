Novak Djokovic's opening Wimbledon match against Soonwoo Kwon was briefly halted twice after two fans required medical attention in Centre Court. The roof was closed on Wimbledon's main court as Djokovic began the defence of his title.   Rain had caused delays on the outside courts earlier in the day with the roof closed on both Centre Court and Court One. An upset looked to be on the cards in the opening exchanges as Kwon raced to a 3-1 lead. But Djokovic soon found his rhythm back on the court he has won six times, picking up five consecutive games to take the opening set. Kwon had recovered to hold serve at the start of the second set, but murmurs in the crowd began attracting some attention. Medical staff were on the scene opposite the royal box where an elderly lady required some attention. Play was stopped on court with both Djokovic and Kwon taking a seat.  She appeared to be conscious as more paramedics arrived on the scene and she was talking to those around her. Play was only briefly stopped before the lady was taken away on a wheelchair. And there was a second medical emergency towards the end of the second set. The crowd opposite the umpire were trying to grab her attention by waving their arms while Kwon was serving. At the next point, loud shouts were made for the game to be stopped as paramedics rushed to attend to the woman. She was soon able to get to her feet, but stumbled as she was helped out of the stands. Djokovic would have been expected to go from strength to strength after taking the first set. But the 20-time major champion's form dropped as Kwon sensed an opportunity to fight back. Uncharacteristic errors were creeping into Djokovic's game and he soon found himself 4-1 down. The crowd were then getting behind Kwon as they saw a chance for the South Korean to level the score at 1-1. And Centre Court erupted when Kwon eventually saw out the set with Djokovic needing to find an answer.
