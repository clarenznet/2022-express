Airports have also had issues with passengers facing lengthy queues at Bristol and Manchester. Many staff were made redundant during Covid and have since found work in other sectors. Travel expert Paul Charles, told Express.co.uk: “I’m afraid that some of these issues will continue into July as it’s taking a long time for airports and airlines to recruit the required number of people. “Shortages of staff are creating bottlenecks in security channels at airports as well as leading to flight cancellations due to lack of flight crew. “Slow Government processing of mandatory security passes, for new starters, is adding to the delays in getting enough resources in the right areas. “All of this is compounded by there simply being fewer people available to recruit. There has been a shrinking of the workforce, either put off by wages being too low or attracted by higher-paying jobs in Europe, giving people no incentive to come to the UK .” Every passenger with a cancelled flight is entitled to a new flight on their intended day of travel. This is the case even if the only available flight is on a rival airline. Passengers could be entitled to cash compensation if the cancellation was short notice. Britons are advised to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport.
