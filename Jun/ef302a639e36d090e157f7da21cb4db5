The Met Office warns of heavy showers and thunderstorms that will break out today, Sunday (June 5) in the afternoon and evening. The severe weather conditions could affect areas in London & South East England, South West England, Wales, and West Midlands. Meteorologists warn that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater and lightning strikes. The fast flowing or deep floodwater could pose danger to life, while communities could become cut off by flooded roads. The severe weather could cause disruptions in transportation too, as flooding and lightning strikes could cause delays and some cancellations to train and bus services. The Met Office also warns motorists of spray and sudden flooding that could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. There is a possibility that power cuts could occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost. The thunderstorms will merge to give longer spells of rain in places, more especially later this afternoon and this evening. According to Met Office, torrential downpours are expected at times with 15-30 mm rain falling in an hour or so in some spots and 30-40 mm perhaps building up over 2 or 3 hours in a few places. These showers will then fade during the course of this evening, but only slowly in some areas, especially over south Wales, the West Country and south Midlands. More to follow...
