Oliva Harrison, 74, delivered a poignant section of poetry to Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour audience from a book of poems she has penned to mark 20 years since his death. She said she wanted to release the book, called "Came the Lightening", to celebrate her late husband’s life and give fans a glimpse of the “man and his humanity.” The couple met in 1974 after Olivia was headhunted to work for the guitarists Dark Horse record label and was flown out to Los Angeles to do an American tour. She was 26 and he was 31 and by the end of the tour they were inseparable. Oliva left LA and moved into the stunning Victorian neogothic Friar Park mansion she still calls home in Henley-on-Thames and from where she wrote her poems. She told the show: “It just sort of bubbled up. Emotions, but especially the emotion of grief, strikes whenever it feels like it and I just had a moment of 20 years – how could this possible be. “I just wrote something and thought ‘if I just keep writing I’ll have one for every year’. Recalling the legendary musicians, she added: “George was a real good guy, he was a sweetheart and I wanted to send something out there on this 20th year because I know how much people still think of him, and listen to his music. “It’s a little bit scary. People know a lot about George through his music, but I wanted them to know what he was like as a person. Small things – I wrote about his body, about very intimate moments. I just wanted people to know a little bit more about the man and his humanity. The poem Another Spring tells of her devastation at the loss of George, who died from lung cancer in 2001 aged 58. It begins: “All I wanted was another Spring. I thought it would be granted and we would see another April day.”
