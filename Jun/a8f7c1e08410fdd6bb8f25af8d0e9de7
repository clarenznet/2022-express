More than 10,000 have crossed by boat since the start of the year - more than double the figure for the same period last year (4,495). The passing of the milestone comes despite the Government's Rwanda plan, which will see asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK by illegal means sent to Rwanda, where their claims will be processed. It aims to reduce the number of migrants crossing the Channel. Yesterday it was reported 79 people arrived at Dover. A total of 28,526 people made the crossing in 2021, compared with 8,466 in 2020, 1,843 in 2019 and 299 in 2018, according to official figures. The Home Office's first deportation flight to Rwanda is scheduled to leave next Tuesday. Matt Vickers, Tory MP for Stockton South, said of the policy: "The Home Secretary must remain steadfast in its execution if she wishes to send a clear message to would-be migrants and people smugglers."
