WARNING: SPOILERS FOR LIGHTYEAR AHEAD. The new Pixar blockbuster concluded with Buzz heading off into space with his motley crew of Space Rangers for a new mission, but did you stay on for all three end credits scenes? The first occurs during the mid-credits and has Commander Burnside having tea in his office, before a giant bug is zapped thanks to the forcefield. Meanwhile, a second arrives as a post-credits scene with ERIC the robot finally coming to the end of his plan from earlier in the movie, only to turn around and discover that everyone had left. But then a surprise third end credits scene followed, even after the Pixar logo. The final scene has James Brolin’s Zurg floating in space, before suddenly seeing his lights come back on. Surely this is setting up a sequel in a Lightyear 2, with a rematch between Buzz and the evil Emperor Zurg? The only thing is, the big twist in the movie was that the space ranger’s arch-nemesis turned out to be a suit containing his older self from the future. This Old Buzz from another timeline wanted to undo the past and reset everything.

Interestingly, the Old Buzz had travelled far into the future and stumbled upon the Zurg suit, ship and minions. With this in mind, perhaps this means that there’s a real Emperor Zurg out there, like the toy one with a cape in Toy Story 2? Lightyear is in UK cinemas now.
