Prince William and Kate beamed as they viewed the new portrait in the Fitzwilliam Museum today (Thursday). The painting, by Jamie Coreth, is their first ever together.  The Duke and Duchess said they were "delighted" to see the portrait. The painting was commissioned last year by the Cambridgeshire Royal Portrait Fund as a gift to the couple's namesake county. The picture shows the royal couple arm in arm, looking off into the distance. In it, Kate wears an emerald green dress and pearl brooch. Prince William is dressed in a black suit and blue tie.   The background is painted to look like a sandstone wall, in an apparent nod to Cambridge's many historical buildings. While visiting Cambridge, the Duchess wore an LK Bennett dress she has had since 2015 and an ankle-length light blue jacket. Prince William dressed smart casual, wearing a blue suit, black suede shoes and an open-neck shirt. Award-winning artist Mr Coreth described painting the royal couple as "surreal", adding that it was "the most extraordinary privilege of my life".  He said he wanted to present the couple "in a manner where they appeared both relaxed and approachable, as well as elegant and dignified. "As it is the first portrait to depict them together, and specifically during their time as The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, I wanted the image to evoke a feeling of balance between their public and private lives. "The piece was commissioned as a gift for the people of Cambridgeshire, and I hope they will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed creating it."  Members of the public will be able to view the portrait in the Fitzwilliam Museum before it is exhibited around Cambridgeshire. It is also expected to be loaned to the National Portrait Gallery - of which the Duchess of Cambridge is patron - in 2023 for its grand reopening.
