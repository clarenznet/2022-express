Emma Raducanu will be hoping to book her place in the third round at Wimbledon with a win over Caroline Garcia in today's second-round clash on Centre Court. The British sensation managed to edge a tight affair with Alison Van Uytvnack in her opening match and will be desperate to produce another strong performance in order to steer clear of an early exit at the All England Club this year. Raducanu secured a straight-sets victory against Van Uytvnack on Monday to make the perfect start on her return to Wimbledon since making the fourth round at last year's tournament. A number of concerns were raised about her fitness levels prior to the match after her injury-hit year to date, but she appeared to be in fine form at the home of British tennis and will be full of confidence going into today's clash against Garcia. Her French opponent will be looking to provide a stern test, though, off the back of her recent doubles triumph at the French Open last month. She was also ranked as a top-five singles player back in 2018 and boasts plenty of Grand Slam pedigree, having managed to reach the quarter-finals at Roland Garros five years ago.
