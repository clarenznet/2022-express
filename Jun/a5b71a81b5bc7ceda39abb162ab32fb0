Christian Eriksen is reportedly choosing between Manchester United and Brentford as the Dane weighs up his options for next season. But United are growing increasingly confident that Eriksen will sign for them this summer. United believe that Eriksen will snub Brentford and move to Old Trafford on a free deal ahead of next season. That's according to talkSport, who claim that United are confident that their offer will be too much for Eriksen to accept, with Brentford their only named rival. Eriksen was linked with a move back to Tottenham, but a return is seen as unlikely. Both United and Brentford have made Eriksen bold offers, with the Red Devils' proposal assumed to be more financially appealing. And with his contract expiring at the end of June, a decision is likely to be made very soon.
