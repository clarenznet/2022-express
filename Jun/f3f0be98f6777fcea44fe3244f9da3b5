Manchester United fans have been dealt their fixtures for the new season, with a host of key dates for fans to put in the diary. Potentially buoyed by the arrival of new boss Erik ten Hag, the Red Devils will hope to close the gap on the top four after enduring a tough campaign in 2021/22, which saw them finish sixth. Ten Hag has been given backing to rejuvenate the squad this summer, with recruiting a new midfielder seemingly top of his priority list. Progress regarding a deal for Frenkie de Jong seems to have stalled, with developments surrounding alternative options for Christian Eriksen and Vitinha gathering pace. Once that position is boxed off, United are expected to go after a new centre-back, with Pau Torres and Jurrien Timber both linked, as well as a new right-back. Fans will therefore head into the new campaign eager to see how the manager and his new faces fair. Man Utd kick off next season against Brighton on August 7th, but fans will quickly skip ahead to dates for crunch clashes against some of their biggest rivals.
