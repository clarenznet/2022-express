Loose Women star Stacey Solomon, 32, had been modelling her new summer swimwear range for In The Style when she made the disclaimer: "I don't work out." She showcased several modest high-waisted bikini looks, featuring delicate and feminine details such as bow ties on each shoulder straps. With her long red hair flowing in loose waves behind her as she posed, Stacey looked like a veritable Little Mermaid. One bikini featured pale pink hues with a ruffled bra top, another boasted a similar style in white, while a third had an orange and white floral design. Though Stacey says she doesn't work on her body, few would be able to tell based on images of her toned and elegant swimwear shots.
