Footage shared on social media shows a large emergency deployment tackling the blaze on Rue de Longchamp, behind the Trocadéro, in the 16th arrondissement of the French capital. According to local media, the fire started on the first floor of the housing block before spreading through the facade to the rest of the building. Firefighters were called to the scene at about 9am, with more than one hundred working on the incident, the Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP) said. According to the BSPP, 13 people were injured, two of whom are in critical condition. The service wrote on Twitter: "Avoid the area and do not clutter emergency lines unnecessarily. Residents, be careful." Eyewitness Sara Tuckey told Express.co.uk: "People are visibly shaken, some evacuated in pyjamas. "The blocked-off area is significant and they’re doing their best to control crowds." Some people were rescued from their homes through the window, the BSPP said, while nearby residents were evacuated. The source of the fire is still unclear. The blaze follows the tragic death of one person after a major fire broke out on Tuesday morning in Paris's 11th arrondissement.
