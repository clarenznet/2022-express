The summer transfer window has only been open a couple of days but the Premier League's elite clubs are already beginning to make their moves as they attempt to strengthen ahead of the new season. Liverpool are closing in on a mega swoop for Benfica's Darwin Nunez, with an £85m deal expected to be confirmed in the coming days. The Reds are not the only side expected to splash the cash, however, and their bitter rivals Manchester United have renewed hope that they can tempt Frenkie de Jong away from Barcelona after the midfielder reportedly changed his mind over a switch to Old Trafford. Tottenham have already confirmed the signings of Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster, and are being linked with a whole host of other players, such as Middlesbrough wing-back Djed Spence, Everton forward Richarlison and Torino centre-back Gleison Bremer. Meanwhile, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City also have a number of targets on their list, and it would be no surprise at all to see the Premier League spending record smashed by the end of the summer. So, what will happen today? Keep an eye across all the latest rumours with Express Sport's live coverage right here...
