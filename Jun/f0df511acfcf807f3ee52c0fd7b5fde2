The picture shows a beaming William with his youngest, Louis, four, sitting on his shoulders, while Charlotte, seven, and George, eight, burst into laughter as they sit on either side of him. The snap was taken in the Jordanian desert when the family went on an unannounced holiday last autumn. Mother Kate, 40, who is an accomplished photographer, has in the past released pictures of her husband and children on special occasions but it is not known whether she took the candid shot. The trip to the Middle Eastern country was only made public when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge later shared a photo of their family at the historic ancient city of Petra that was used for their Christmas card. Releasing another picture from their trip abroad suggests that the family time the five spend together away from the limelight remains extremely precious. Kate lived in the capital Amman for a few years during nursery when her father, Michael Middleton, was based there with British Airways. In 2011, the family released a photo of Kate, sister Pippa and their father when, as children, they visited the ancient ruins of Jerash. And William made his first trip in 2018 as part of an official royal visit to Jordan, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In a speech then, he said Kate was "very sorry she cannot be here with me so soon after the birth of our son Louis but her family remembers very fondly the almost three years she spent here as a child when her father worked for British Airways." The UK and Jordan have had close ties since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, with the two royal houses enjoying a warm relationship. Last November, Prince Charles and Camilla spent four days in Jordan to mark the country's centenary and 100 years of the UK-Jordan bilateral relationship.
