Motorsport fans witnessed a heart-in-mouth moment on Saturday when IndyCar driver Romain Grosjean slammed into the wall during Detroit Grand Prix qualifying. The Frenchman's rear-left tyre clipped the outside wall after rounding a bend too fast, causing him to lose control as his car collided into the barrier at the following turn. All four of Grosjean's tyres at one point left the ground as Andretti's No. 28 incurred heavy damage. The entire right side of his car crumpled as a result of the impact, with the front-right tyre almost ripped from the chassis altogether. Formula 1 fans were quick to be reminded of Grosjean's infamous crash at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, which ended up being his final appearance in the sport. The 36-year-old escaped with second-degree burns to his hands after his car split in two and caught fire following a massive crash on the first lap. Swiss-born Grosjean has remarked himself that he was "lucky to be alive" following the blaze in Bahrain. Supporters were grateful he suffered no visible injuries on Saturday and walked away from the crash in good health.
