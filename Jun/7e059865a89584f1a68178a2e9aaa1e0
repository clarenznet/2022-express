The American punk-rock star, 32, had been performing at Madison Square Garden earlier in the evening before heading to Catch Steakhouse New York with his celebrity pals, where he treated them to another performance. While up on stage in the afterparty venue, MGK shouted: "I don't give a s**t", before smashing the glass against his face, in a video he shared to Instagram on Wednesday morning, captioned: "This is where things turned". Following the event, the star held hands with his supportive partner Megan Fox as she walked close behind him before heading home after the bash. MGK's sheer pink top was also stained with blood, as well as his neck and hands. Despite his injured appearance, the rocker didn't appear disheartened as he flashed a smile for the cameras while leaving the party with his fiancée, who dazzled in a bright pink ab-baring outfit.
