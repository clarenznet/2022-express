Westward Ho's coveted beach huts don't tend to linger on the market, and this one is no exception, having been sold for at least £30,000, despite being in need of a lick of paint. The agent could not disclose whether it went for more than the asking price.  With peeling paintwork and a fraying roof, the blue and yellow hut, named 'Lazy Daze', was described as "sold as seen." However, that didn't seem to deter the flurry of prospective buyers. In fact, Simon Bright, Director of Bright's estate agent says the enquiries are still flooding in - even though the hut is no longer available. "If we'd had four or five of them, we could have sold them all," he told Devon Live. "Measuring just 2.44m x 1.76m, Lazy Daze is located just off the promenade, close to Seafield House - aka The Haunted House - and the Pier House restaurant. It comes with mains electricity and the right to access a water tap. "Surrounded by a generous plot, it boasts stunning views out to sea. Simon added that this was the first beach hut they'd had this year, and that they are rarely put on the market. Beach huts have soared in popularity in recent years, making them even harder to get hold of. In some parts of the UK, the candy-coloured huts can sell for six figures. Although such figures haven't yet been achieved in Westward Ho!, Simon said they were becoming increasingly sought-after. "Every time we get one, they go up in price," he commented.
