Wimbledon is to announce four new measures to prevent Covid outbreak after two top players, Matteo Berrettini and Marin Cilic, were forced to withdraw from the Grand Slam after testing positive. Wimbledon has responded with immediate new measures to help prevent the spread of Covid at the All England Club.  Across the ground there will be increased cleaning "in high traffic touch points, enhanced ventilation and provision of more hand sanitiser stations". Players will also see a change around the grounds with masks now being made readily available for anyone who wants them. And they will also be required to wear masks for medical consultations if they take place indoors. Meanwhile, Mr Djokovic has hit out at Covid rules in the Grand Slam at the US Open, branding the move "political". He joked he would be picked up by the US authorities if he attempted to play at the US Open and hit out at the 'political logic' behind his ban. The Serbian had his visa revoked in Australia earlier this year because he is unvaccinated. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
