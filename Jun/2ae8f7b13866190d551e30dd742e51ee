The Formula One freight train has hurtled into Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix this weekend as the 2022 season enters round nine. Max Verstappen is 21 points clear of Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez in the Drivers' Championship courtesy of his victory in Azerbaijan last Sunday as rivals Ferrari suffered a double DNF, dropping Charles Leclerc down the standings. Mercedes finished third and fourth through George Russell and Lewis Hamilton but only through Ferrari's misfortune with the Silver Arrows still much slower than their rivals. But ahead of the next race in Canada they have been offered hope of improvement. That's because the FIA said on Thursday they will be taking steps to reduce the high-speed bouncing of cars on safety grounds. Mercedes have been arguably the worst-affected team with Russell and Hamilton both struggling with back pain at times, and the Silver Arrows calling for changes. FIA's governing body has released a technical directive explaining plans to solve porpoising problems following consultation with doctors "in the interests of safety of the drivers". Express Sport will have all the reaction to that decision and more in our F1 news live blog below.
