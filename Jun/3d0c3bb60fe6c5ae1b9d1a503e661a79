The charity is calling for the Government to make child protection a priority after the shocking revelations. The figures follow a Freedom of Information request to police forces in England. Two weeks ago, the Independent Review into Children's Social Care and the National Review into the deaths of Arthur Labinjo- Hughes and Star Hobson catalogued the violence faced by some babies and children. NSPCC chief Sir Peter Wanless said: "The statistics demonstrate the worrying scale of abuse and neglect." "The evidence from reviews has shown how to better support a child protection system that works better. Now is the time for action." Paula Hudgell is the adoptive mother of Tony, eight, whose parents were jailed after injuring his legs, which had to be amputated. She said: "We hope no child experiences what Tony went through. "However, that won't be made possible without government leading the way and reforming the children's social care system." It comes as a BBC report alleged children in care have been groomed and sexually assaulted in homes run by a successful firm. Employees of Calcot Services for Children have claimed vulnerable young people were failed. The report found it made profits of 36 per cent last year, double that of other big care providers. Calcot said profits were high because of built-up investment, and that it prioritises safeguarding children.
