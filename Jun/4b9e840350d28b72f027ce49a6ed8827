Broadcast 2040+ claims old-fashioned viewing and listening should be safeguarded as an essential service for pensioners, rural communities and vulnerable groups. Officials fear Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ could eventually force out terrestrial TV. The campaign is backed by pensioners' groups SilverVoices and Age UK. It wants a Government pledge to protect Freeview terrestrial television beyond 2040.  Dennis Reed, the Silver Voices director, said: "Older people in their millions depend on terrestrial TV and radio as their main link with developments in the outside world. "And older people rely on Freeview, as many cannot afford the cost of streaming services, especially with the cost-of-living crisis. "We are concerned that relying on a broadband-based radio and TV system would be less reliable and much more costly - putting TV beyond those on benefits or the state pension. A significant minority could end up excluded from the modern world, increasing loneliness and depression."  Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: "Broadcast TV and radio is especially important for older audiences, particularly those on low incomes and living alone. "Many older people value the current universal services and would struggle to afford alternatives such as subscriptions services.  "Watching familiar shows or a public event, such as the recent Jubilee, helps older people feel more connected, giving them a sense of comfort in what can be an isolating world." Graham Biggs, of the Rural Services Network said: "This issue is of fundamental importance to rural areas." Broadcast 2040+, spearheaded by telecom mast firm Arqiva, said streaming services are more expensive and require access to a super-fast broadband connection. Launching the campaign yesterday, organisers said figures show 44 per cent of over-65s who live alone would feel "very lonely" without the terrestrial service. Freeview is accessed through 35 million British TV sets.
