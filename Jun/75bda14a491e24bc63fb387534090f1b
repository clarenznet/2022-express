For a time she was as famous as Twiggy, but she left the modelling world behind in the early 1970s when she married impresario Gold, whose club Tramp in Jermyn Street became a glamorous haven for film stars. Extrovert Gold entertained luminaries such as Peter Sellers, Princess Margaret, Marlon Brando, George Best and countless celebrities, while Jan made sure they felt relaxed and at home. The combination was a brilliant success and they forged friendships with many of the clientele. At the family home in St John's Wood, London, she enjoyed having friends such as Robin Williams over for Sunday lunch.
