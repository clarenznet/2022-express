Sarah Silverman, 51, attended the 75th annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York on Sunday. The comedian made a fashion statement on the red carpet, as she sported a tiny frilly black mesh dress. The gothic dress featured a fusion of polka dot and lace covered sleeves. She then paired the dress with fishnet stockings and chunky black boots. The back of the dress cheekily displayed the black bra she wore underneath. Sarah wore her dark locks in a beehive hairstyle as she side-swept her bangs at the front. She added small silver hoop earrings and a pink lip gloss.
