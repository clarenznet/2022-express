Musician Elvis Costello, 67, had publicly savaged Rod Stewart's rendition of Neil Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline' at the Party at The Palace. When the subject had come up at a Glasgow concert he played during his tour with The Imposters last week, he insisted that Rod's vocals were "s***e" and the unrepentant star has since defiantly confirmed his views on Twitter. Elvis described fellow Jubilee performer Diana Ross as a "deity" whose songs could have been covered by Rod instead. He then added: "If you read my actual remark, it was about the wrong-headed idea of asking Sir Rod pass up 'You Wear It Well' to lead a f*****g singalong!" Clarifying his position, he added during the online spat: "Have some damn respect. "I was joking about the many uncomfortable choices that were overlooked."

"The show was good, wasn’t it? Wasn’t it? No, it was s***e," he sneered. "I mean, I know you all love him and he’s one of yours and everything, but Rod. What the f***?" "I must say, listen, we all have bad nights vocally, but for f*** sake, Sweet f***ing Caroline," he exclaimed. "Are you f***ing kidding me? I mean I’ve been in showbusiness 45 years so I do know a thing or two." He continued in astonishment: "How is it that nobody suggested Rod sing 'You Wear It Well?'” The musician, who received a standing ovation for his set that night, also repeatedly referenced the Supremes singer Diana Ross and questioned why different tunes had not been used.

Elvis wasn't the only person who had criticised Rod's performance to mark the 70th anniversary of the Queen's reign on the throne. Many viewers took to Twitter to express their horror at the song, branding his "drunk uncle at a wedding" act "embarrassing". However his wife Penny Lancaster explained that Rod had just recovered from a bout of Covid at the time that he belted out the classic. It was also reported that the BBC requested the song after it had been voted by listeners of Radio Two. Rod also made it clear that he enjoyed the night, telling Naga Munchetty on BBC Breakfast that day that he was honoured to mark the Queen's special day, as she was "like a sister" to him. Other performers on the night included Sam Ryder, Sir Elton John and Alicia Keys, who also came under fire for her song choices. She reported that the Queen had personally requested a rendition of Empire State of Mind - in spite of the song having been written for the city of New York.
