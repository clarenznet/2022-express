Carol Vorderman, 61, looked phenomenal yesterday in a picture shared with her 225,000 Instagram followers. The Countdown star could be seen in the story, which she had reposted from her friend Nathan Sussex, wearing a skin-tight green jumpsuit, which accentuated her curves. The pair could be seen matching and posing with broad smiles beside decorations in the BBC Radio Wales studio. Nathan captioned the picture: “3 years ago met ma radio wife @carolvorders the green goddesses.” (Sic)
