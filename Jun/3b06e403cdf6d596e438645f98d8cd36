Members of the GMB employed by Veolia in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, voted in favour of a deal the union claimed is worth an extra Â£2 an hour.  Deanne Ferguson, a GMB official, said: "At a time when workers are feeling large financial pressures due to the cost-offrom living crisis, I am pleased Veolia has listened to our members' requests. "They've offered a pay rise which will make a real difference to their working lives. GMB members, some of the lowest paid in the country, were prepared to take strike action to secure a fair pay increase."
