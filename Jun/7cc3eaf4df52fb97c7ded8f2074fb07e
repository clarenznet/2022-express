Part of a restaurant on the ground floor of a parade of shops and offices was damaged by the fire, London Fire Brigade said in a statement. Fire crews were called shortly after 11am on Wednesday, June 29. The fire was brought under control at around 2pm. The cause of the fire is not known at this stage. Station Commander Matt Williams, who was at the scene, said: "The fire broke out in a ground floor restaurant and crews worked hard to bring it under control. "The blaze involved the restaurant's ducting (extraction) system. "One of the Brigade's 32m ladders was in use as an observation tower. "Edgware Road was closed and there was heavy traffic nearby so we advised people to avoid the area where possible." Fire crews from Paddington, Euston, Soho and Kensington fire stations were called to the scene. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. UPDATES TO FOLLOWâ€¦
