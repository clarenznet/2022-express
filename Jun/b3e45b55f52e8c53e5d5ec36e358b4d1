The explosion was feared to be linked to a faulty boiler at the three-bed terraced home in Kingstanding, Birmingham. The woman was named last night as Doreen Rees-Bibb, 79. Police said David Murphy was in a “life-threatening” condition after he was saved. Callum Attwood said he had run in to help, adding: “He said his partner was still inside.We tried to get to her but the flames and heat was too much.” A rescuer, who declined to give his name, said: “His clothes had been blown off...he was covered in blood” while neighbour Josh Turner said: “His missus Doreen was stuck.” Mr Murphy’s son Dean said he was “not in a good way”. Other homes were hit and some 20 people moved out. The recently-sold property was described in the estate agent’s particulars as: “Boiler requires repair/replacement.” Area fire commander Alex Shapland said the boiler “may form part of the investigation” into Sunday night’s blast.
