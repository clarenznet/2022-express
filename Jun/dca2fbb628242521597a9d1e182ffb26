Cadbury's parent company, Mondelez International said it was working hard to resolve the distribution issues. It is a repeat of summer 2021 when there was a similar Flake shortage, reports Birmingham Live. A spokesperson for Mondelez International said: "In line with what many other companies are reporting, we are experiencing some global supply chain disruptions." This is "alongside a recent increase in demand for the product in the UK and Ireland above the levels that we agreed with our customers at the start of the year," the chocolate maker's owner added. They continued: “This means we are experiencing some short-term stock challenges on Flake 99. “We are working, and will continue to work hard, to resolve the situation, and are working closely with our direct distributive customers to manage stock allocation fairly based on initial forecasts." It comes ahead of a forecast sweltering heatwave this weekend. Mondelez International added: "Flake 99 is available for our customers to order but, for now, we are just carefully managing stock allocation fairly across all our customers." Forecasters have predicted some parts of England will experience a heatwave later this week as temperatures are predicted to jump to 28C (82F) in the North East and North West and 30C (86F) in the south east on Friday. However, they have said that it is likely the heatwave will be short-lived. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Rudman said the temperature predictions are unusual for this time of year. Cadbury's Flakes are produced in two factory locations - one in Dublin, Ireland and the other near Cairo, Egypt. Cadbury, formerly Cadbury's and Cadbury Schweppes, has been fully owned by Mondelez International (originally Kraft Foods) since 2010. John Cadbury founded the confectionery company in Birmingham in 1824.
