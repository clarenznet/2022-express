Matteo Berrettini admitted he was trying not to cry after successfully defending his Queen's title from last year with a straight-sets win over Filip Krajinovic. The No 2 seed only just returned to the Tour last week after three months out due to a hand injury.  He beat Andy Murray in his first tournament back to win the Stuttgart Open and took that form into Queen's this week. Berrettini beat Cameron Norrie in last year's final and faced a different test this time around against Krajinovic. But the Serbian was no match for Berrettini as he strolled to victory to keep up his perfect grasscourt record this year. Berrettini now joins illustrious company in defending his Queen's title and the 26-year-old joked: "I forgot how heavy it [the trophy] was". But he was also clearly emotional as he stood up on the court holding his trophy as he fought back the tears.

"The last thing I expected was coming back from a surgery and winning two titles in a row, defending my title here, one of the most prestigious titles we have so I don't know. "I don't want to cry but most of the job is thanks to them, my team, my family and my people who are close to me."  Berrettini now has his sights set on "another goal" when Wimbledon begins later this month. "Every time I walk in these hallways, it's always kind of tricky. I get lost all the time in the clubhouse," he said. "I see all the names. All the champions from the past and present and now knowing it's going to be me twice in the same wall gives me goosebumps so I'm really happy for what I've done." He added: "I couldn't ask for a better start and preparation but I think this tournament wasn't a preparation for Wimbledon, this was the Queen's so I came here to defend my title. It's one of the most prestigious tournaments that we have so I'm really happy and from next week there is another goal."
