Lady Eliza Spencer, 29, looked absolutely radiant today for the Royal Ascot. The niece of the late Princess Diana wore a £3,816 skirt from the Michael Kors Collection for the occasion. This fishnet and lace circle skirt is knee-length and looks fantastic on the young royal.  A spokesperson from Michael Kors said: "Michael Kors is pleased to announce that Lady Eliza Spencer wore a black knit pullover, black/suntan floral soutache lace embroidered skirt, black calf wrap belt and Audrey bucket bag. "Lady Amelia Spencer wore a black/white organic silk crepe de chine midi dress and black gramercy minaudière from the Spring Summer 2022 Michael Kors Collection, whilst attending Royal Ascot on Wednesday June 15th, 2022." Eliza paired her skirt with a simple black T-shirt, a black belt and a pair of black stiletto heel shoes.  The showstopper of the outfit was an eccentric black veil hat which was absolutely massive on Eliza. Eliza kept with the theme of black for all of her accessories.  The niece of Princess Diana carried a Michael Kors handbag for the occasion. This perfectly matched Eliza's Michael Kors skirt. The black bag was an Audrey medium leather bucket bag.  It retails on the Michael Kors website for a sensational £759.  Lady Eliza attended Ascot today with her twin sister, Lady Amelia Spencer. Lady Amelia stunned beside her sister in a black and white leopard print maxi dress. She chose to follow with the Michael Kors theme too. The 29-year-old royal wore a dress from the Spring Summer 2022 Michael Kors Collection. The two nieces of Princess Diana are the daughters of Earl Charles Spencer, Diana's younger brother. Their mother is the famous fashion model, Victoria Aitken.
