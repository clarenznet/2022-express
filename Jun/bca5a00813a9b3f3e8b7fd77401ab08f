Neighbours actress Kylie Minogue, 54, looked ageless last night while leaving a hotel on the Upper East Side in New York City. The Can't Get You Out of My Head singer donned an all-black outfit that showcased her toned legs. Kylie opted for a chic ensemble consisting of a double-breasted blazer mini dress and knee-high black boots. She styled her wavy blonde hair in a middle parting and showed off her youthful complexion with minimal make-up that featured a bold smokey eye and blush lips.
