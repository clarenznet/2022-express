Three generations of the Presley family including Priscilla, 77, her daughter Lisa Marie, 54, and her daughters Riley, 33, and twins Harper and Finley, 13 were pictured at the Hand and Footprint Ceremony held outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood yesterday. Priscilla flaunted her youthful appearance rocking her signature reddish hair parted on the side and she also sported a black suit with a white shirt but no tie. Lisa Marie wore a black suit with a tie and a crisp white shirt with her highlighted hair worn down. Her eldest daughter Riley, whose dad is Lisa Marie's ex Danny Keough, sported a cut-out dress as she flashed her abs. Lisa's twin daughters also accompanied the family at the ceremony. Also in attendance was Austin Butler, who plays the rock star in the new movie Elvis, and the film's director Baz Luhrmann.
