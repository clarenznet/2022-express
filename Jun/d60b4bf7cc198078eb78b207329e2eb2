Britain left the EU single market following the 2016 Brexit referendum vote. However, Northern Ireland remained in the single market to prevent a hard border from being created with the Republic of Ireland. Lord Hannan, who is an adviser to the Board of Trade has claimed that if Britain had remained in the single market it would have saved a lot of '"trouble". However, he argued that rejoining it now would be "madness". Writing in The Telegraph, he said: "We should have stayed in the single market, but rejoining it now would be madness "Leaving the market was an upheaval, but it was the chance to deregulate. Instead, ministers are retaining rules we once fought to repeal." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
