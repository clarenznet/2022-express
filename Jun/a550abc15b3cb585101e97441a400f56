Chickenpox has several symptoms, the most common of these is an itchy and spotty rash.    This rash can appear anywhere on the body. The NHS say these spots can also:• Spread or stay in a small area• Be red, pink, darker, or the same colour as surrounding skin• Be harder to see on brown and black skin. Furthermore, these same spots may start to fill with fluid and become blisters; said blisters may then burst and form a scab. While these spots are the main symptom of chickenpox, other symptoms include:• A high temperature• Aches and pains• Loss of appetite. Although chickenpox is most common in children, it can also affect adults. Despite the uncomfortable symptoms, chickenpox is a common condition. It is recommended any individual with chickenpox should stay away from work or school for at least five days after the spots have appeared. The NHS recommends someone speak to their GP if they’re not sure whether or not it's chickenpox or if they’re concerned about their child.
