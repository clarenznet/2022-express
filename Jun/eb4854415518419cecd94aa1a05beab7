The baby boy was found at approximately 5pm in a brown garden waste bin with the umbilical cord still attached. The boy was taken to hospital and is being treated there. There are reports that a concerned resident heard a baby's crying coming from the bin and then, upon lifting the lid, found the tot in among the grass cuttings. The baby’s young mother has been found and was also taken to hospital where she is being cared for by the relevant authorities. There was a large response by Humberside Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service - at least four police cars and vans were at the scene accompanied by two ambulances.    Officers were seen going door to door to speak to shocked residents. The Nunsthorpe estate, where the baby was found, is home to families and pensioners in semi-detached and terraced housing. One resident told Grimsby Live: “"The mum must have been too young to understand or did not want anyone to know she was pregnant. We only hope she gets the care she needs and her baby."
