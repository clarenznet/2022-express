Rafael Nadal has a number of in-game rituals that have helped him to become an all-time tennis great. He's often seen changing his shirt between games, as well as lining up his water bottles before stepping out onto the court. Nadal has been a professional tennis player for more than 20 years, winning 92 titles along the way. He stormed to victory in this year's Australian Open, coming back from two sets down to Daniil Medvedev. The Spaniard has adopted a number of superstitious tactics to help him reach dazzling heights throughout his career. Some fans have even been questioning why Nadal regularly changes his top during matches.

Wearing sweaty tops makes him feel cold, so he'd quite happily change into a fresh shirt and stick a jacket on while waiting. "I don’t want to get cold," Nadal previously explained. "That’s the reason." "Maybe the other players are not sweating as much as I do, so I cannot stay during all the interviews, everything, having sign autograph for the fans for 10 minutes or that with the same t-shirt." Nadal has previously admitted he feels more self-assured during matches after completing his rituals. "Each [player] has to find their way of concentrating. There is no absolute formula,” he said. "I would like not to have them, I am not hiding, but tennis is such a mentally aggressive sport that anything external I was able to distract. I always do it and I don’t always get it. "It works for me and they make me focus while I compete. I feel more sure of myself."
