Paige Sandhu, 25, blew onlookers away as she turned up to Saturdayâ€™s British Soap Awards wearing a sequinned mint green mini dress with long sleeves that trailed by her side. The Emmerdale villain was sure to make an entrance as she lifted the sleeves above her shoulders to give a very ethereal illusion. Paige, who plays Meena Jutla, looked sensational in the gown and paired it with some strappy silver heels. Her hair was styled straight and she matched her green eyeshadow to the dress and paired the look with a nude lip. The brunette beamed as she posed for cameras on the red-carpet, which she has every reason to do as she is nominated for four awards this evening. Paige is up for Best Leading Performer, Villain of the Year, Best Storyline and Scene of the Year.
