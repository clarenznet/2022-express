In its regular poll, YouGov asked respondents whether they thought Britain was right or wrong to leave the EU. It shows that 49 percent believe it was wrong while 37 percent say it was the right decision. Simon Hix, who chairsÂ VoteWatch.eu, tweeted: "The two lines are highly correlated, so when Right goes down, Wrong goes up. The Don't Knows are stable at about 12-14 percent. What we don't know from these data, though, is how many Rights are shifting to Wrongs vs. how many Rights shifting to DKs + DKs shifting to Wrongs." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
