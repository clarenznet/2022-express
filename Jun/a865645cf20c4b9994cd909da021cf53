But she was astonished when she felt contractions just two days into the vacation. Baby Hugo was born 14 weeks early, weighing under 2lbs. He has been kept in hospital on a ventilator due to problems with his intestines and blood. Now Dawn and partner David Wright, 30, are desperately trying to raise money to get him home. David said: “Hugo is extremely weak. He’s already had a blood transfusion as his blood levels were getting low. He also has issues with his intestines, which they are monitoring. “He is in critical care and we are now going to be stuck in Mexico while he recovers to full strength so we can get home. It could take three to four months. “We are running low on money after all the bills we’ve had to pay up front, and now we need to find a place to stay near the hospital so we can be close by. “It’s tough. It’s particularly hard to get more details on Hugo’s problems because we don’t speak Spanish, and their English is limited too.” The couple, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, are staying in an apartment next to the hospital in west Mexico. David, a plasterer, and law student Dawn thanked everyone who has donated to their Go Fund Me appeal online.
