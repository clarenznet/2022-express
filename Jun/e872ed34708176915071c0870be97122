Trooping the Colour is the first day of celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee weekend. The Queen's grandchild, Lady Louise, looked beautiful and summery as she attended the celebrations. She wore a dark pink dress with a white flower pattern. The 18-year-old also donned a classic white jacket. But the focus of the ensemble was certainly her huge hat in camel.  The young royal is wearing the Printed Cut Out Back Midi Dress from Reiss, retailed at Â£158. She has not been spotted in this before.
