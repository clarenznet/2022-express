Chelsee Healey and Jennifer Metcalfe play Goldie and Mercedes McQueen respectively on the Channel 4 soap, Hollyoaks. The on-screen sisters were full of smiles away from their intense TV roles as they arrived at the British Soap Awards 2022. Chelsee attracted attention in her cut-out dress, baring her waist, cleavage and thigh in the very revealing all-black number. She teamed it with velvet elbow length gloves, while showcasing her hair in a bouffant updo. Meanwhile on-screen sister Jennifer glammed it up in a black vinyl bodycon dress with a slightly more demure split up one leg. The pair laughed, kissed and held hands as they posed for the cameras - and while Jennifer's character Mercedes is normally battling angst due to the death of her husband and losing parental rights to her child, her real-life persona was much more cheerful today.
