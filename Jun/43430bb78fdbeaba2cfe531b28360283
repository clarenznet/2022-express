Many of the Premier League's top teams are stepping up their transfer activity before players return for pre-season and there are many big moves expected to take place this summer. Erik ten Hag will want to put his stamp on the Manchester United squad after joining from Ajax. The Dutchman is looking for at least two blockbuster arrivals to strengthen the team after a dismal 2021/22 campaign, in which they missed out on Champions League football. Tottenham crept into the top four and are now set to back Antonio Conte with a £150million war chest. After missing out on the quadruple and with Sadio Mane expected to leave the club, Liverpool will be making moves to add reinforcements to their attacking ranks. Jurgen Klopp will also look to add some fresh legs into his midfield. Chelsea are finally over their ownership problems and are looking at ways to offload Romelu Lukaku. If they are able to get the Belgian's £350,000-a-week wages off the books then Thomas Tuchel may can inject a fresh lease of life into the team. FOLLOW LIVE TRANSFER UPDATES BELOW
