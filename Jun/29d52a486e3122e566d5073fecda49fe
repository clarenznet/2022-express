Monkeys at Trentham Monkey Forest, in Staffordshire, were treated to a live performance of classic soul tracks including Let's Get It On and Sexual Healing in February. There were nine babies born at the attraction last year meaning it has been a "fantastic start” to the birthing season with a few more still on the way. The new additions will have many babysitters as male Barbary monkeys take an active role in caring for the smallest members of the group, a characteristic rare amongst primates. Barbary macaques are a highly endangered species, with fewer than 8,000 in the wild. Matt Lovatt, park director, said: “Monkeys being serenaded by Marvin Gaye – who’d have thought it? Head guide Anna Smith said: “The new arrivals are doing brilliantly, and we can’t wait to see them develop in the coming weeks and months.” "We thought it could be a creative way to encourage our females to show a little affection to males that might not have been so lucky in love. "Females in season mate with several males, so paternity amongst our furry residents is never known. “Each birth is vital to the species, with barbary macaques being classed as endangered.”
