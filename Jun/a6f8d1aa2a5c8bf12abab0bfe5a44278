Gossip Girl actress Elizabeth Hurley, 57, looked amazing as she coordinated her look with the red carpet in a mesmerising skintight busty dress. The red dress featured embellished sequin detailing, further accentuating the model's incredible figure. The strappy dress left Liz's ample assets on full display, while the tulle skirt added a touch of glamour to the outfit. She accompanied the dress with red heels, silver dangly earrings and a gold box clutch. Liz wore her signature brunette locks in soft waves, while going for a rich make-up palette accompanied with a pink glossy lip. The model was attending the Raffaello Summer Day event yesterday in Berlin.
