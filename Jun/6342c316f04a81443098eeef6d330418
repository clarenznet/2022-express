Emma Raducanu kick-started her Wimbledon campaign with a win against Alison Van Uytvanck. The British sensation will be made her debut on Centre Court, following Novak Djokovic's match with Kwon Soon-woo and defeated the in-form Belgian 6-4 6-4. Raducanu was aware of the test in front of her but insisted she was confident she can beat 'anybody' as she looks to go another step further after reaching the round of 16 last year. Speaking about her opponent ahead of her Wimbledon return, the Brit said: "I played her in August last year [at a WTA 125 event in Chicago]. It's nine months ago. I think she was the top seed at the time. I kind of just got into the tournament. I definitely feel like game-wise I back myself pretty much against anyone. I feel if I really put my mind to it and commit, then I can be pretty good. So I'm definitely looking forward to the match." And it was a successfil homecoming for the 10th seed, who secured a 6-4 6-4 win over the world No 46 - who had won two titles on grass already this season. "She hits the ball really hard so it’s tough," Raducanu said of her opponent after the win, as she added: "I’m just so happy to stay another day."
