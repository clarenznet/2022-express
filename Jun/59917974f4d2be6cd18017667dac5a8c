 The attacks happened at a demonstration against anti-protest measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Det Supt James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset Police, described Horn's behaviour as "disgusting". He said: "She denied she was part of a group which used or threatened violence which caused others to fear for their safety. But the evidence we presented to the jury was clear."
