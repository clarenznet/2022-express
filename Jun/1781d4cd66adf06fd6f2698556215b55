Frankie Bridge, 33, stunned as she posed for a mirror selfie on her Instagram. She shared the snap in view of her 1.5 million followers as she promoted her attire. The Loose Women panellist showed off her taut abs as she posed in black lounge underwear, leaving her ample assets on full display. She styled the lounge set with an oversized near floor length striped shirt, adding another layer to the stylish attire. This comes after Frankie took to Instagram last week to share her multiple outfit blunders as she filmed a clothing haul. She accidentally revealed her underwear as she struggled to get into the white floral satin dress. The mum-of-three wrote in the caption: "The reality of making my #frankiesfaves Zara Haul. "This dress is great... but a b***h to get into."
