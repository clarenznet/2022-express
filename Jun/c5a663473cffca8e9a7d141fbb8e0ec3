The supermarket has said that it will be cutting the price of more than 420 products for online customers in the countdown to payday. The offer will extend to food shop essentials such as milk, bread and butter. The deal from Iceland comes as grocery analysts warn prices could rise by 15 per cent this summer - and leave shoppers skipping meals.  To get the money off, you’ll need to include three items that are part of the deal in your order on the Iceland website. Once you reach the checkout stage, enter “ICEPENNY” as a promotional code before paying, the Mirror reports. The deal will allow customers to save up to 99p per product, based on an item costing £1 originally. It will run from June 18 until June 24 at midnight. Iceland dropped the prices of its vegetables to 1p last Christmas and Easter, with almost 10,000 shoppers snapping up the offer over Easter. Richard Walker, Managing Director at Iceland, said: “We’re continuing to work hard to ensure our customers are being supported as much as possible as the cost of living continues to rise and we hope our 3p everyday essentials sale will help a little this weekend.   “Our previous sales at Christmas and Easter were very popular and this time we’ve taken the decision to branch out and offer this deal on everyday essentials, as well as vegetables, to help our customers as we navigate through the cost-of-living crisis. “We’re committed to helping our customers as much as we can at this difficult time and will continue to do so.”  Iceland offers shoppers free next delivery when they spend £40 online. There is also an option to have your groceries delivered the same day if you’re shopping in stores. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said that households are set to pay more for essentials including dairy, bread and meat as inflation is predicted to hit 11%. A typical family of four's shopping bills could rise as much as £40 per month, it warned.
