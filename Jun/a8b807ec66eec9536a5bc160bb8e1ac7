Three fire crews and a team of paramedics were deployed to rescue a man who had got into trouble in the water at Salford Quays, Greater Manchester. He was visibly struggling in the Manchester Ship Canal. He has now been rushed to hospital after being pulled from the water. Since then, police have arrived to question witnesses and have cordoned off a large area by the waterway. Photographs on Manchester Evening News show a raft of emergency service vehicles at Salford Quays, an urban regeneration complex. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: "Just after 11am this morning, North West Ambulance Service requested our support at a water rescue incident in Salford Quays. "A man had been seen in difficulty in the water. Firefighters from Eccles and Salford and the technical rescue unit from Leigh attended the scene and recovered a man from the water. "He has been taken to hospital."  One shocked witness said he was having a sandwich on a bench by the canal when he saw the man in the water and immediately called for an ambulance. A reporter for Manchester Evening News tweeted from the scene: "There is still a large police presence at the Salford Quays tram stop, and a cordon up by the water. "A small area of Salford Quays itself is cordoned off next to the tram stop." No further details about the man, including his age, condition or severity of his injuries, have been disclosed by police at this stage. Greater Manchester Police have, though, been approached for comment.
