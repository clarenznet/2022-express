Madonna, 63, dared to bare earlier today as she shared a series of racy photos on social media, which saw her crawl on the floor as she gave the camera a fierce look. The Material Girl singer spilled out of a risqu√© black leather corset top that exposed her pink lace bra. For the pictures, which she shared with her 18.3 million followers, Madonna posed in a series of indoor locations, including an ample bed and what appeared to be a walk-in closet. The pop star paired the top with a matching Adidas shorts and jacket outfit in bright yellow, and finished the look with some black leather heeled boots.
