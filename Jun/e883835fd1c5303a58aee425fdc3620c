TikTok user @aribasfoodmood, who often shares home and garden hacks, posted a video called "Keep mosquitos away from your home". All people need is "seven or eight cloves and one garlic". She explained: "Peel the garlic and insert the cloves in the garlic." Place the garlic with the cloves on a little plate or bowl.
