No Time to Die star Ana de Armas, 34, looked very different back in 2014 as she dyed her hair a lighter shade. The actress, whose natural hair is dark, sported blonde locks during the 17th Malaga Film Festival closing ceremony. For the event, which took place at the Cervantes Theater in Malaga, Spain, Ana opted for putting her hair up in a braided style. She also chose a show stopping floor-length gown with gold ripple patterns that matched her bold red lipstick.
