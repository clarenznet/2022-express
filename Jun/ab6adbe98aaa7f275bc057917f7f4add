Sophia Loren, 87, took Hollywood by storm, being named one of the greatest female stars of Classical Hollywood cinema. Her first English language debut was 1957's The Boy On A Dolphin, with Sophia turning heads in unearthed snaps from the film. The actress stunned in a tight-fitted dress, which was soaked through from the water, as she filmed on a boat in Hydra, Greece. Sophia left little to the imagination as she went braless for the scene, but sported underwear beneath the dress. The wet dress drew in the actress's enviable waist, while her messy damp hair perfectly complemented her attire. Speaking to The New York Times last year about the film, she said: "I will never forget Hydra… one of the most beautiful places in the world. "I did a picture, ‘The Boy on a Dolphin,’ in Greece, in Hydra, one of the most beautiful places in the world. I remember it really with great, great joy. "Because, for me, it was a moment of starting in the American cinema and I was starting my romance with my husband, and so I’m attached also for what I discovered in my husband. "It was a beautiful, euphoric moment for me. I will never forget Hydra." The film was based on the 1955 novel of the same name by David Divine. Sophia played the leading role of Phaedra, a poor Greek sponge diver on the island of Hydra. The actress was married to well-known Italian producer Carlo Ponti, who died in 2007. She has two sons from her marriage and now lives in Switzerland.
