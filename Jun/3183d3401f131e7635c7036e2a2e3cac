Saturday morning at Goodwood Festival of Speed saw ‘Grand Prix greats’ including Damon Hill and Nigel Mansell piloting some of racing’s most iconic cars up the famous hill. And in a memorable moment, 1996 F1 champion Damon Hill climbed into his father’s car after sixty years. Graham Hill was a two-time Formula One champion and his BRM P578 car gleamed in the late morning sunshine as his son took it around the circuit. It was the car that Mr Hill senior drove to victory in the 1962 drivers championship. Damon Hill followed in his footsteps 34 years later as he became world champion driving for Williams. Graham Hill died tragically young at 45, however, his death didn’t come on the racetrack, rather at the controls of a light aircraft.

Elsewhere on Saturday morning, F1 legend Jenson Button was seen piloting an all-electric car, the Nitro RallyCross FC1-X. There were also several electric supercars attempting to beat the world record for the hill climb. The current record time was set in 2019 by Romain Dumas in an electric Volkswagen I.D. R at 39.9 seconds.
