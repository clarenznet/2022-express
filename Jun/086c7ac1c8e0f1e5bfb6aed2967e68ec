Kate Middleton, 40, and Prince William, 39, attended the memorial for Grenfell Tower today. The Duchess of Cambridge chose her Suzannah dress which she wore to Wimbledon back in 2019. The 'flippy wiggle dress' is still in stock and retails for a whopping £2,450.  The description for the dress on the website says: "The original inspiration derives from a late 1940’s Wiggle Dress, which we have re-cut to have it skim over the bodice with a fluid gentle soft movement throughout the skirt, from the hips to the hemline. "The silhouette is contoured around the waist and front yoke with delicate pin-tucks. "The dress is designed to be an elegant tea-length featuring beautiful half-length sleeves with a buttoned cuff. "The contrasting silk covered buttons work from double to single breasted down the centre front for closure.

Kate styled her hair in a sleek straight fashion behind her ears which she has been doing a lot lately. The Duchess showcased this hairstyle at the premiere for Top Gun with Tom Cruise last month. This is a departure from her wavy blowdry which royal fans have become used to over the past decade.  Kate also appeared to be wearing a pair of high heeled shoes by Alessandra Rich. The beige stiletto heel shoes with a black pointed toe cost £369.04. They are currently on sale from £631.89, which is almost half price. Royal fans took to social media to praise Kate's style. Twitter user @Canellelabelle said: "Properly dressed down, properly elegant!" Another fan, @CantamessaLisa added: "Great outfit. "Love the connection between the shoes and the buttons."
