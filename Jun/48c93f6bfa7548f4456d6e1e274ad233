The intervention by Lord Evans, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, was seen as uncomfortable for No10. The committee’s role is to advise the Prime Minister on arrangements for upholding ethical standards of conduct across public life in England. Lord Evans told the BBC: “I think you’ve got to raise questions when you see the outcome of the police investigations and the Sue Gray report, and one or two of the other issues that have come up.” The crossbench peer added: “There has been a lot of public disquiet about standards over the last six months. It’s one of those things that comes up from time to time and it’s really important to reassure people that we want to continue to maintain decent standards in this country.” It also emerged that another Tory MP has publicly attacked Mr Johnson’s conduct during partygate. Backbencher Andrew Bowie said he was “utterly appalled” by behaviour in Downing Street. He said the Prime Minister bore “ultimate responsibility” but did not call for his resignation. There is speculation that the required number of signatures of Tory MPs to trigger a confidence vote could be reached next week. The threshold is 54. More than 40 Tory MPs have publicly criticised Mr Johnson since the publication of civil servant Sue Gray’s final report into lockdown parties. In response to Lord Evans’s remarks, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “Boris Johnson has shown himself unfit to uphold high standards in public life and is lowering the bar each and every day he clings to office, trying to rig the rules as he faces investigation for deliberately misleading Parliament. “It’s time to stop the rot.”
