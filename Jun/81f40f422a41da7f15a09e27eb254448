In view of her 236k followers on Instagram, Shirley said: “Hi everybody, at 8:20 today I’ll be on This Morning talking mental health and we’ll be looking at the exhibition that they have done on the South Bank with all the beautiful angels who took their own lives, so tune in. “See you there,” the 61-year-old signed off. In a follow up post, Shirley posed in her stunning blue wrap midi dress and gold wedges, having broken down in tears as she spoke to hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield about her brother David, who took his own life at 44. She wrote alongside the photo: “For anyone struggling reach out please @calmzone. “Difficult morning. X” she added. Later, in a video filmed from the portrait exhibition of people who had taken their own lives, Shirley asked her fans to consider bringing a friend who was struggling mentally down to the South Bank to speak to the Calm Zone specialists.
