Maya Jama, 27, looked elegant in a tiered fuchsia and burgundy full-length dress and a matching headpiece. The presenter arrived at Ascot Racecourse in Berkshire in style with her hair styled in a sleek ponytail. While Maya’s tiered frill dress was sure to turn heads, her pièce de résistance stole the show with an intricate design featuring bright pink flowers. The broadcaster completed the look with some gold strappy heeled sandals and delicate drop earrings.
