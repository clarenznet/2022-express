Woodfield Primary School in Balby, Doncaster, has sent out an urgent email telling parents about the worrying incident. A spokesperson for Woodfield Primary School has now confirmed both the children ae safe at home. One of the men was arrested by South Yorkshire police but the other escaped, the headteacher told parents. They stressed the need for extra vigilance. According to the Mirror, it read: "You may already be aware, due to reports on social media, but we have been informed this morning that, yesterday evening, two men attempted to snatch two children of primary school age from Weston Road. One was caught and arrested and the other got away. Thankfully both girls are safe. "Please be extra vigilant and ensure you report anything untoward to the police direct. We strongly recommend that all children are collected from school by an adult over the age of 18." A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: "Police are aware of reports circulating online regarding suspicious behaviour in Weston Road, Balby. "We would encourage anyone with concerns to report them to us so we can investigate. Please call 101 or report online."    The message from the school has been shared widely on Facebook by worried parents. It came after police received a report of an attempted kidnap only a few miles away earlier this month. It is alleged that a man grabbed a young boy from his father in a park in Armthorpe Road, Doncaster. It was reported a man ran a short distance with the boy before the father caught up with him. The frantic father grabbed his son back before calling police. The boy was taken to hospital, but did not have any serious injuries.
