Queen Letizia's stunning 11-bedroom mansion is located in Madrid. What does it look like inside? It is home to King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and their daughters, Princess Leonor and Infanta Sofía. The palace was originally a hunting lodge for King Felipe IV and was built between 1627 and 1635. Formerly a rectangular building with two side wings, the residence is a far cry from what it is now. It now contains reception rooms, a library, a dining room and King's office.

One room boasts Marble flooring, extravagant gold ornaments and an intricate painting. Said painting is encased in a large golden frame. The walls are camel coloured. In another room a huge patterned tapestry depicting a scene hangs from the wall. This is flanked by a chic white chair, an elaborate gold table and metal sculptures. One such sculpture in the Palace of Zarzuela is a man kicking a football. This sits atop a wooden dressing table, which boasts yellow, orange and brown detailing. The carpet is an exciting mixture of white, pale blue and yellow. It also includes a touch of pink. The entrance to one room is a huge wooden door fashioned with elaborate patterns. One cosy room boasts lampshades and a crimson sofa. In total, the mansion has 11 bedrooms and nine bathrooms. Outside the majestic building there is an Italian garden, fountains, terraces, a vegetable garden and a tree nursery. Royal fans can get a sneak peek of the Palace when King Felipe VI delivers his Christmas speech.
