Dame Julie Andrews, 86, became the youngest solo artist to perform at a Royal Command Variety Performance aged 13. The Sound of Music star left the audience stunned as she performed in front of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on November 1, 1948. The event took place at the London Palladium and was captured on camera by British Pathé, which was then known as Pathé News. In the footage, Julie looked adorable as she sang the British National Anthem accompanied by a choir before members of the Royal Family. She could be seen running across the stage to her spot in the centre in front of US actor Danny Kaye. Julie took the stage alongside other well-known names including the Nicholas Brothers and the comedy duo George and Bert Bernard. The Mary Poppins actress’ career started in London's West End in 1948 and included Broadway musicals such as My Fair Lady and Camelot.
