The kitesurfer was killed and eight others were injured after the sudden "mini tornado" hit a Normandy beach on June 18. The resulting extreme weather event caused one 31-year-old to be thrown through a restaurant window. After the tornado hit people were taken to hospital and one person was killed.   The tornado hit the Normandy coast town of Villers-sur-Mer. Residents of the town received little warning of what French media called a "mini tornado". The tornado formed over the English Channel before making landfall. Footage shows strong winds kicking up clouds of sand on the beach.   The high winds forced beach attendants to fold up towels and umbrellas. However, the high winds increased in strength with chairs and tables being blown around. Thierry Granturco, the mayor of Villers-sur-Mer, called the winds a "violence as we have never known on our coast". The winds lasted 20-25 minutes on the Côte Fleurie, Flowery Coast, between Ouistreham and Deauville. Mr Granturco spoke to French media called Franceinfo and said: "It blew more and more violently and it ended with a mini tornado. "We had a communication with Météo France who had informed us that they had not been able to anticipate this kind of mini tornado." He added: "We knew we were going to have strong winds. "They were announced at the very end of the evening, or even in the night, but we did not think that they would be of this violence."
