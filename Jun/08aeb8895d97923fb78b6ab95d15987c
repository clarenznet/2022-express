Hey Duggee The Live Theatre Show will welcome the titular character, The Squirrels and a collection of their loveable friends to the stage later this year. Attendees can expect singing, dancing, and endless reams of fun on the tour. The eccentric and exciting characters are going to be brought to life for the first time in live-action through "innovative puppetry and storytelling". And fans don't have long to wait. The tour dates begin this December and run through to Summer 2023. And tickets go on sale very soon. The tickets for the Hey Duggee Live Theatre Show will be available for purchase this Friday, July 1, 2022, at 10am. The tour kicks off on December 3, 2022, in Southampton at the MAST Mayflower Studios. From there, the tour will run through Darlington, into Edinburgh, back down to Liverpool, and across the rest of the UK. Prices for the show's tickets have not yet been announced but they will be available here on ticketmaster. A full list of tour dates can be found at the bottom of this article. It's no wonder the tour is so extensive, considering it was won six BAFTAs since 2014. It has also become the "most streamed children's show" on the BBC iPlayer in 2021. Ben Hatton, the director of theatre touring for Cuffe and Taylor - the show's promoters - said: "This is an incredibly exciting tour. Hey Duggee is quite simply a phenomenon and has taken the world of children’s entertainment by storm." He added: "We are delighted to be working with Kenny and his team at Kenny Wax Family Entertainment, as well as all the extended Hey Duggee family at Studio AKA and BBC Studios. We look forward to Duggee and his friends filling theatres around the UK." The show's producer, Kenny Wax, added: "We are so thrilled to be working with Live Nation, Cuffe and Taylor, Studio AKA and BBC Studios to create a brand new stage show with lots of surprises touring the country with a sit down month in London over Christmas. I can't wait." The BBC's Mat Way said: "Studio AKA’s Hey Duggee is such a fun and iconic show and we can’t wait to bring the humour and adventures to life for families all around the country. We’re delighted to be working with Kenny Wax and Cuffe and Taylor to introduce young people to the wonders of the theatre." Hey Duggee tickets go on sale on Friday at 10am. A maximum of nine tickets per person and per household will apply. SCROLL DOWN FOR A FULL LIST OF HEY DUGGEE TOUR DATES.
