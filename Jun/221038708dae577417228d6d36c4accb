The Duke and Duchess of Sussex returned to the UK to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, a mark of the Queen's 70 years on the throne. Their anticipated return marked the couple's first public engagement with the Firm since their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in which they accused a member of the family of racism and Harry lashed out at Charles for being absent during his childhood. Meghan also accused the Palace of "perpetuating falsehoods" and suggested "one of the most senior' people rejected her pleas for help. Nile Gardiner, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, commented: Still waiting for Meghan Markle's apology to the Royal Family and the British people for all her failed attacks on the Monarchy. Judging by the massive success of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee her campaign hasn't been a great success. She may want to think about a different career." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
