Lewis Hamilton has admitted to having secret talks with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The seven-time champion said he spoke to Ben Sulayem ahead of the race despite the new FIA boss’ criticism of the Mercedes star. It comes just weeks after he called out Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel for their campaigning on human rights issues. He claimed drivers should not be able to force their opinions on others and claimed stars from older eras just drove their cars. Ben Sulayem was forced to later backtrack on his comments after he was slammed for the remarks. Meanwhile, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has warned Hamilton may not participate in this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix after suffering from severe back pain. When asked if Hamiton may not be able to compete in Montreal, Wolff simply responded ‘Yeah, definitely’. Mclaren are also embroiled in a team orders row after Lando Norris was refused the chance to race Daniel Ricciardo for position. The youngster claimed taking orders from engineers was ‘tough’ and added drivers ‘need to race’.
