Rebel Wilson, 42, looked like a vintage pin-up model from the 1950s as she set sail on a luxurious yacht. The star donned a pale pink high waisted boucle effect bikini with a matching jacket. She looked all set for summer as she teamed her swimwear with a pair of chic white sunglasses and clutched a wide-brimmed hat. Rebel looked the picture of classic beauty as she stared out over the ocean while her tousled blonde hair hung over her shoulders. Earlier this month, she officially revealed to her 11.2 million followers in an Instagram post that she is gay. The Aussie actress is dating girlfriend Ramona Agruma, who was nowhere to be seen in her holiday snaps.
