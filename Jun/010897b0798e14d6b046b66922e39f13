Virgin Media already has some very good deals but the firm has just launched a new offer that could be very hard to refuse. For a limited time, the broadband firm is giving away a pin-sharp 43-inch LG television - worth over £470 - to customers who sign up for some of its bundles. The free telly comes with packages including the Bigger + Sports, Bigger + Movies or Ultimate Volt bundles. Those who sign up will then be sent this big screen which features a 4K Ultra HD panel and immersive AI Sound which booms audio around the room without the need for additional speakers. It's also fully connected with instant access to apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video. If that TV doesn't sound of interest then don't panic as Virgin is also offering £200 bill credit instead. This cash is added to your account and can be used to chop down the monthly bills. Here are all the deals that include the free LG TV and how much each bundle costs.

Virgin also has also slashed the price of its broadband-only plans with things starting from just £20 per month. That's for standard 50Mbps speeds which are fine for basic music streaming and surfing the web. If you want something faster there's also M100 for £24 per month - both of these offers also include Talk Weekends which allow you to chat with friends and family without it adding extra expense to the monthly bills.
