Davina McCall, 54, showed off her incredible physique today as she took to social media to share a new video. The Masked Singer judge could be seen basking in the sunshine in Turkey while taking a dip in the swimming pool. The slo-mo clip, shared with her 1.5 million followers, shows Davina smiling and posing up a storm as she gets out of the pool movie-star style. Davina looked fabulous as she put her ageless figure on display in a white bikini while announcing the first “diary post” of her holiday.
