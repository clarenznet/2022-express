The Spanish donned a beautiful dress by designer Manuel Pertegaz. The wedding gown reportedly cost £6million. One of the reasons why the design was so expensive was the gold thread embroidery that was used in the silky dress.  Queen Letizia accessorised it with a diamond tiara, gifted to her by her mother-in-law Queen Sofia. Stylist Melita Latham commented: “Thousands of hours went into making these iconic wedding dresses. “From embroidered flowers of all 53 commonwealth countries for Meghan's wedding dress, embellished with beads, lace and pearls, 10,000 on Princess Diana's dress and Kate Middleton's nine feet train. “[And] I can't imagine how many hours it took embroidering real gold into silk [for Queen Letizia’s dress]."

"Royal wedding spend has increased vastly during the Queen’s reign, as these events become country-wide celebrations with high expectations. “The impact of a royal wedding cannot be underestimated though - we’re still seeing echoes of royal brides from days gone by in wedding fashion today, with puff sleeves, flounced full skirts, and sumptuous satin fabrics all over the bridal runways this year, proving that those royal dresses truly were a timeless investment.” The Queen - cost of dress: £30,000 - currently valued at: £1,200,000 Kate Middleton - cost of dress: £250,000 - currently valued at: £325,000 Princess Eugenie - cost of dress: £200,000 - currently valued at: £216,000 Lady Diana Spencer - cost of dress: £11,000 - currently valued at: £151,000 Meghan Markle - cost of dress: £110,000 - currently valued at: £120,000
