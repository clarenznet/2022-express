Bridgerton actress Sabrina Bartlett looked stunning as she donned a slinky black velvet gown at tonight’s Boodles Boxing Ball. The 30-year-old played soprano Siena Rosso, love interest of Jonathan Bailey’s Anthony Bridgerton, in the first series of Bridgerton in 2020. She also played Mariette Larkin in The Larkins (2021). Sabrina posed on the red carpet at the glitzy bash in London’s Billingsgate. Her wavy hair was styled in a side parting, and she accessorised her elegant look with silver jewellery and perspex sandals.
