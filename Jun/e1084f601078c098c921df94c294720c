Families thought they'd captured the rare sighting of a panther splashing in the water in Exmouth, Devon, but, on closer inspection, they found it was actually a full-sized sculpture made out of driftwood. Brendan Rawlings "took an age" to burn the black on the wood but was delighted with the life-like result. Speaking to Devon Live, the talented artist said: "It took an age to burn the black on but I’m thrilled with the look. There have been multiple sightings over the UK since the Dangerous Wild Animals Act was introduced in 1976. My dad spotted a large black cat on Woodbury common back in the '80s when out for a run, so when I’m out running or walking somewhere remote, it’s always on my mind. "If they are roaming about the UK, then 'resilience' is a perfect word to describe them, having adapted to a foreign climate and continued to survive. Perhaps we could take a leaf out of their book in the coming years with our economic climate worsening?" And so Brendan named his creation Resilience before snapping it in a photoshoot on the sand on Wednesday afternoon. In the past, the dad also created a 12ft Neptune/ Poseidon wooden sculpture, an imposing 6ft crouching male angel with wings and a child angel called Faith modelled on his daughter, Kitty. Brendan, the creator and artist of Zen Wood Design, made his brother-in-law a shark made from driftwood in 2019. He was quickly inundated with commissions for further designs. Within just three weeks, he had enough interest to keep him busy full-time in a workshop in Topsham, Devon. Previously he ran a successful fitness company in Dubai and then returned to Devon in the summer of 2017 with his family. Brendan now spends much of his time working on commissions while also planning what his next special project to surprise locals with will be. He said: "Apart from a busy diary of commissions, I am planning a number of other sculptures this year. My next project is a large galloping horse sculpture which I’m excited about."
