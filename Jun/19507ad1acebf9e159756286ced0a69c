Dianne Buswell, 33, has been on Strictly Come Dancing since 2017, reaching the final with her now-boyfriend Joe Sugg in 2018. The professional dancer regularly answers fans' questions on Instagram, with one leading her to share an awkward insight to the Strictly Professionals tour. The fan asked: "Did anyone have any onstage mishaps during the pro tour?" Dianne replied in view of her 869,000 followers with a short video of her awkward on-stage wardrobe malfunction. While dancing with her partner the red tutu element of her outfit slid down from her waist. Dianne, however, being very professional, saved what could have been an awkward situation by flicking the skirt to her hand and making it part of the routine.
