Elon Musk, 50, has previously dated actresses such as Amber Heard, 36, but his latest film star beau is Natasha Bassett. The 30-year-old Sydney native wowed in a white boho crop top with flowing sleeves and a pair of high waisted pale pink trousers, leaving her toned waist on show at a glitzy event. She has a starring role - her most high-profile to date - in the upcoming Elvis Presley biopic. To celebrate, she was snapped with three generations of the Presley family while they preserved their hand and foot prints at LA's legendary Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The flawless star added an unexpected splash of colour to the pastel outfit by pairing it with a contrasting bright lime green croc print handbag. It has recently been revealed that the burgeoning relationship between Elon and Natasha, who could scarcely stop smiling as she stepped out in Hollywood, has dated back years on and off.
