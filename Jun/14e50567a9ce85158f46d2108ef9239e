Juno Temple, 32, looked stunning in her daring gown at a London screening of Ted Lasso on Sunday. The actress, who plays Keeley Jones, wore a black halter neck gown which left the entirety of her toned stomach area exposed. On the bottom half of the edgy dress was a low rise pencil skirt with a slit up the leg, and she accessorised with trendy black gloves which ended at the tops of her arms. She wore her blonde locks in elegant waves and her silver jewellery and bag topped the look off perfectly. Juno was joined by her co-stars Hannah Waddingham and Jason Sudeikis, who play Rebecca Welton and Ted Lasso respectively.
