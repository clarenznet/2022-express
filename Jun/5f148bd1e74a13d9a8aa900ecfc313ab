Police searching for Lieutenant colonel Andrew Haldane, 45, say the discovery was made in Abberley, Worcestershire, and, though formal identification is yet to take place, his relatives have been informed of the development. The consultant anaesthetist vanished after leaving work at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on Monday evening. The man, from Ombersley, Worcestershire, worked at the hospital helping COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, reports Birmingham Live. Colleagues made desperate online appeals to find the missing doctor over the past 24 hours as they grew increasingly concerned. Officers have been keen to trace the silver Ford Focus Estate he was driving. A West Mercia Police spokesperson said: "Police searching for missing Worcester man Andrew Haldane have found a body. The body was found earlier today in Netherton Lane in Abberley. "Formal identification has yet to take place however Andrew’s family has been informed." The doctor was reported missing yesterday(Tuesday, June 7) when he failed to return home from work."  Lt Col Haldane is connected to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, which treats general patients and injured soldiers at the QE Hospital. Despite being an anaesthetist attached to the theatre team involved in surgeries, during the pandemic, he helped intubate Covid patients. Professor David Rosser, chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust that runs the hospital, also joined in appeals to find the doctor earlier today on social media channels. Colleague Dr Nick Crombie, a Trauma Anaesthetist at the QE hospital, appealed for help tweeting a photo of his friend saying: "North Worcestershire and surrounds - this is Andy - he is a colleague, a friend and a good man."
