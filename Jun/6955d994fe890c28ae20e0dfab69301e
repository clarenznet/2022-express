Amanda Holden, 51, looked fabulous earlier today as she left the Heart FM studios. The presenter put her impossibly toned legs on display as she paired a lime green cut-out blazer dress with some gold strappy heels. She accessorised the chic look with a white handbag and black maxi glasses. Amanda chose to wear her long blonde tresses down, keeping the style casual as she walked around Central London.
