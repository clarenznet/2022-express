Oreo came into the care of Woodgreen Pets Charity's Cambridgeshire centre in July 2021 when her previous owner was no longer able to keep her. Since then, the eight-year-old Labrador cross has not had a single potential adopter visit her. Woodgreen has now launched a special appeal in a bid to finally find her a loving forever home. Oreo is described as very affectionate once she has bonded with someone. The Labrador cross is currently being fostered by Taff and Alison Squire. Mr Squire said: “Oreo is the best dog ever because she’s so loving, and she’s settled into our home really well. "We’ve got closer and closer to her over the last few months and she’s a real joy and comfort to be around. “Don’t be deceived by Oreo’s age – she’s still full of beans. "She’s very intelligent, more so than she lets on, and you see the best of her out on walks with her nose down sniffing and her tail wagging. "Although Oreo doesn’t like playing too much, we enjoy the occasional chase around the garden. "She’s happiest either sitting in the sunshine looking out of the window or by your side. She really is a great companion.” Oreo is looking for a quiet home where she is the only pet, although she may be able to live with older children. Her new owners will need to visit her at the centre several times to get to know her before taking her back with them. Natalie Powdrill-Wells from Woodgreen said: “We are appealing to anyone who could offer a home to a dog who is most in need, like Oreo. "It won’t always be easy and there will be challenges along the way, but the rewards will be immense. “You’ll have to love them as they are, quirks and all, and recognise that they may never be the perfect all-round dog who can happily interact with strangers and other pets. "But in the comfort of their home, where they can relax, they’ll be a wonderful addition to your family and will repay your commitment many times over.” Find out more about Oreo here.
