Louise Redknapp took to Instagram to share a series of stunning bikini snaps as she continues to enjoy the heatwave this weekend. Musical star Louise, 47, looked phenomenal as she posed in a black bandeau bikini and an oversized, lemon yellow shirt to keep her cool. The star thoughtfully let her fans know her attire was from clothing brand Yaitte, tagging the clothing brand as she posed for snaps. The ex-wife of footballing legend Jamie Redknapp exuded a sun-kissed glow after perfecting her tan. Louise looked fresh faced as she wore little to no make-up for the snaps, revealing her flawless complexion. She wore her balayage locks in a half-up, half-down style which kept her tresses away from her face.
