Lulu Kennedy-Cairns, 73, stunned last night as she walked the red carpet at the 2022 LGBT Awards in an oversized purple shirt. The star-studded event took place at The Brewery in Central London and was presided over byÂ host and comedian Sue Perkins. Lulu made a stellar appearance in an oversized purple shirt that she paired with black trousers and T-strap shoes. The singer complemented the chic look by styling her hair in a messy high bun and donning some dark sunglasses.
