The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have staged a charm offensive in the US over the last year, which is expected to culminate in a visit for the Earthshot Prize ceremony in autumn. Prince William's climate change passion project, the Earthshot Prize, rewards innovative solutions to the crisis and is expected to come to America in October. If William and Kate do travel to the ceremony, it will be the first major royal visit to America since Harry and Meghan moved there after quitting royal duties in March 2020. The move comes after a tense reunion for William and Harry at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The brothers were placed on opposite sides of St Paul's Cathedral for the thanksgiving service and it later emerged William and Kate were unable to attend Lilibet's first birthday party due to diary clashes.
