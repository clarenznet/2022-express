West Midlands Police are renewing calls for members of the public to submit photos of motorists who have parked dangerously. The campaign, dubbed Operation Park Safe, was first launched in 2018 and led to “thousands” of residents being penalised. Local councils were given more power to fine people for driving offences, last month.  Authorities across England and Wales now have the power to issue Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) for offences, such as driving through no-vehicle entry points and stopping in yellow boxes at junctions and bus lanes. If a motorist is caught on CCTV, they will be sent a fine of up to £70 through the post. So, if you saw an instance of selfish parking, would you report it to the police?
