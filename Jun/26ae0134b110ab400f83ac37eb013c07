Last weekend, British Summertime 2022 kicked off with a stunning hat trick of music megastars. Elton John kicked it off in style, followed by The Rolling Stones on Saturday and The Eagles on Sunday. The Stones are back again with their second and final show this Sunday, but first up is Adele, supported by Gabrielle and US country music sensation Kacey Musgraves. As well as the headliners this weekend, Duran Duran and Pearl Jam will take the main stage in subsequent weekends. Hosted again by American Express you can scroll down for all the gorgeous privileges you can enjoy if you upgrade to the American Express Experience and Summer Garden enclosure. And it is worth repeating that last weekend mobile phone networks struggled with the volume of people in such a small space, so make sure you make clear plans before you go in about when and where to meet friends at easily identified landmarks on the map below because you probably won't be able to call them once you are inside. Scroll down for the stage and times for The Eagles tonight, June 26. Plus all the support acts on the main stage and three smaller satellite stages, which kick off in the afternoon. NEAREST TUBE: Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly Line is closest for the main South Entrance. For the North Entrance at the far end of the enclosure, use Marble Arch station on the Central Line. MAP BELOW:  As well as finding all the stages, food outlets and toilets, use the map to arrange the best place and time to meet anyone who you are trying to find once you are inside British Summertime. There will be up to 65,000 people there and potentially limited mobile phone coverage so make your plans in advance. ARE FOOD AND DRINK ALLOWED? No. Only sealed bottles of water up to 500ml or baby food in plastic containers. You can also take in empty bottles and refill them at drinking water points. ARE SEATS ALLOWED? No. Not even folding ones, anything inflatable or those clever ones you stick in the ground. ARE BAGS ALLOWED? Yes but only small ones - no bigger than 30x21x21cm.
