Chelsea are engaged in talks with Inter Milan over a deal to send Romelu Lukaku to the Italian giants on an initial loan. Inter have seen their first approach for the striker turned down, and are reportedly ready to make a fresh bid. Lukaku's second stint at Chelsea has been little short of a disaster, with the Belgian failing to deliver on the club-record £97.5million transfer fee paid for him a year ago. Off-pitch controversies have clouded his time at Stamford Bridge, with Lukaku admitting he wanted to return to Inter. The striker's relationship with Thomas Tuchel has reportedly broken down almost beyond repair. Lukaku barely featured for the Blues in the second half of the season, with Tuchel preferring Kai Havertz through the middle up top. Now, it seems his second spell at Chelsea is coming to a close, with Inter believed to be in advanced talks to take him back. The Athletic reports Inter's initial bid was rejected, but an improved offer is expected by Chelsea. Inter are said to be prepared to pay Lukaku's entire wages, but aren't able to get near a transfer fee Chelsea would accept, leaving a loan the most reasonable option. Chelsea rejected an offer which included a €5million (£4.2m) loan fee - though an improved offer with a more substantial loan fee is expected. The Blues are also said to be eager to sign players from Inter in return, which is currently holding up the deal. New owner Todd Boehly is also apparently unsure about letting the club's most expensive player walk away from Chelsea a year after he joined, leaving the Blues once again needing to buy a new striker. Last year they held an interest in Erling Haaland prior to signing Lukaku, but the Norwegian will instead be playing against Tuchel's side for Manchester City after completing a £51m move.
