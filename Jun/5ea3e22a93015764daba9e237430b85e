Tottenham have a chance of competing with Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League if they make another couple of signings, believes Dean Saunders. Spurs finished fourth last season but have spent big this summer in an attempt to close the gap. Tottenham have backed Antonio Conte in the summer transfer window and have spent heavily to reinforce their squad. Richarlison is set to become their fourth signing of the summer today in a Â£50million deal. The Brazilian is set to undergo a medical with Spurs after Everton agreed a deal in principle to sell him to the north London side. He will join Ivan Perisic, Yves Bissouma and Fraser Forster through the doors, with Djed Spence and Clement Lenglet also being eyed up. Spurs qualified for the Champions League after a terrific end to the season, and will therefore have a heavily-congested fixture schedule next year. As a result, Conte is eager to bolster his squad with quality in depth. And Saunders believes that if they keep spending as they have been, they could challenge Liverpool and City at the top of the table. Speaking on talkSPORT, he claimed Spurs are just a couple of signings short of competing. "A couple more signings before the season starts... if they sign a world-class centre-back and right-back, they're in with a chance," he said. "Liverpool have just lost Mane. Man City have strengthened. "[Spurs] are in with a chance of knocking on the door, I don't think they'll get above Man City and Liverpool, but they'll be nearer than they were last year. "They'll give them a run for their money, they'll be closer to them, and I think they could win a cup. I think the manager is a winner, he's driving those players to something." Express Sport understands Tottenham are still determined to sign Middlesbrough right-back Spence this summer, but are yet to agree a deal with the Championship side. As a result, Boro are losing patiance with Spurs considering the lack of a concrete offer.
