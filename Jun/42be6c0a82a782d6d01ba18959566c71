As well as tackling the minefield of dating, this year’s contestants will also be offered training in how to “create safe spaces” and avoid “microaggressions”. ITV says it wanted to educate the Love Islanders to “understand different lived experiences”. Laura, 37, said the show’s appeal is universal, explaining: “What I love about Love Island is that the fan base is such a wide range of people – from grandparents to younger viewers. It’s not just for people the same age as the islanders. I’m sometimes surprised when people stop me – they are so invested and are asking, ‘What are they really like?’” She said: “People are obsessed with what they eat in there. “I guess we don’t show a lot of that as it’s quite boring to watch people eat.” She went on: “My mum is big into it! She says, ‘Tell me something no one else knows yet!’” Meanwhile, ITV has confirmed its “duty of care protocols” for the mental health of contestants. This year’s islanders will receive “inclusion training”, exploring language and behaviour. Extensive welfare measures are also in place to provide support to contestants – before, during and after filming. Ahead of this series, contributors will be offered “video training and guidance covering inclusive language around disability, sexuality, race and ethnicity, behaviours and microaggressions”. Ade Rawcliffe, group director of diversity and inclusion at ITV, said: “The world we live in is changing every day. “We want all of our islanders to feel they are part of an inclusive environment in the villa.” The video training will involve interviews with former “islanders” talking about their experiences.
