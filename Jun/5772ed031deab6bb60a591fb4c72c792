Britain will ship M270 launchers across to the front lines of the war with Russia, which will afford “a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainian forces”, according to the Foreign Office. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said this move was part of the UK’s stance in solidarity with Ukraine, and how it “has taken a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country”. He described how the weapons would give Ukrainian soldiers a boost against long-range artillery bombardment from Vladimir Putin’s forces. He added: “As Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. “These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against Russia’s brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.” Mr Wallace then said the decision had been “coordinated closely” with the US weapons shipments being sent to Ukraine, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System bound for the country that shares many similarities with the UK rocket systems. The US Defence Department revealed they would send four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems in a statement on Wednesday. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
