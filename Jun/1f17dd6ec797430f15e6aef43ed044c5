  Speaking about the new product that debuts tomorrow in view of the 792,000 followers on her beauty account, the singer looked as though she had put a filter on the clip. Jennifer’s skin looked smooth and her eyes looked extra wide as she spoke on her Instagram story. This is not the first time the star has posed from her bathtub, as she previously embraced the bubbles in some sultry snaps on June 5. Speaking to the 214 million followers on her main account, she captioned the snaps: “Happiness is a long hot bubble bath (even if you have to take a quick call!) See you later @MTV!!!!”
