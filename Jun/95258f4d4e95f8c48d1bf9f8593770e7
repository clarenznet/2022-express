Jane, 71, was a vision in a bright pink, off the shoulder number which revealed her fabulous figure. The actress looked ever the A-list star as she walked the red carpet in the tight-fitting garment, which she accessorised with a pink and yellow scarf draped over her arms. Jane added a touch of glam to her outfit with a huge pearl necklace, matching earrings and rings. She wore a pair of strappy white heels which added to her summery vibe. Jane looked fresh-faced as she wore a natural face of make-up, complete with a nude lip, as she swirled around for snaps.
