Laughing, socialising and feeling secure in their home were also identified by over-60s as key to enjoying advancing years. And nearly half (43 percent) of those in the age bracket say this time of life has been the happiest. Other pearls of wisdom were refusing to take offence, to remember your achievements and that boredom is the enemy of happiness. Sarah Clarke- Kuehn, of care home provider Sanctuary Care, which carried out the survey, said: "It's wonderful to hear so many older people expressing strong feelings of happiness in later life. The results show finding a renewed sense of purpose is essential." Some 79 percent loved getting outdoors for positive therapy, with three-quarters in favour of having a good laugh. Unsurprisingly, men and women did not always agree. Sex and intimacy seem more important to older men (29 percent) than senior women (12 percent). But general tips include maintaining loving, friendly connections.
