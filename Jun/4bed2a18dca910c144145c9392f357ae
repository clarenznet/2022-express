Queen Elizabeth wore a light blue dress, a diamond brooch and her signature pearl necklace and earrings for this year's Trooping the Colour celebration.  Her Majesty chose the same blue gown she donned for her Platinum Jubilee portraits earlier this week.

The Queen combined the stylish gown with a matching hat.
