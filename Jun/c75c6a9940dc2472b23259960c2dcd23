Liz Hurley, 57, posted a carousel of Instagram snaps to her 2.4 million followers - sporting a lemon yellow bikini from her own swimwear line. Telling fans to "let the sunshine in" via her caption, the Basingstoke native looked gorgeous as she posed for the shots. Her two-piece bikini featured a triangle design with a pleated rope-tied section on the bottoms, leaving her toned torso revealed as she posed on a bicycle. With her brunette tresses left to fall freely onto her shoulders, Liz ported a radiant makeup look with a glossy pink lip. Taking the holiday-ready look from day to night, the final snap showed Liz sporting a halter neck O-ring dress.
