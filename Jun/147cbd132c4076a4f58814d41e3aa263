"One of the aircrew suffered a non-life threatening injury and was transported to a local hospital." It comes after another crash nearby led to the deaths of five US Marines, according to a press release from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. An MV-22B Osprey crashed near Glamis close to Coachella Canal Road and Highway 78. The Osprey is a so-called "vertical take-off and landing" aircraft that has a rotary wing which means it can be manoeuvred like a helicopter or an aeroplane. They said: "While military service is inherently dangerous, the loss of life is always difficult. "Third Marine Aircraft Wing is committed to providing support to the families, friends, and fellow service members of the fallen Marines." There have been 12 Osprey crashes since 1991, killing 46 people in total. Most recently four US Marines were killed during a NATO exercise in Norway.
