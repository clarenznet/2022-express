The Duke of Cambridge was left "angry" after Harry spoke to Oprah Winfrey with wife Meghan about racism in the Royal Family, but he does not want a "public slanging match" over it as he is "allergic to drama". A royal insider said: " William alternates between grieving for what he has lost and feeling really, really angry about what his brother has done." "He truly loves Harry and feels he has lost the only person, aside from his wife, who understood this strange life of theirs."
