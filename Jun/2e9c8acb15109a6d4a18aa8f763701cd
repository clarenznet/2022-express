The Foreign Secretary said there was "absolutely no reason" for the "negative" reaction from Brussels to the UK plans for overhauling the Northern Ireland protocol. She insisted negotiations had hit a dead end as the EU was not willing to agree fundamental changes. The UK faces legal action from Brussels after the move to override large parts of the deal struck over Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements. But Ms Truss told Times Radio: "Our solution doesn't make the EU any worse off." "We continue to protect the single market, we're supplying the EU with data, we've got strong enforcement to make sure companies aren't violating the rules." The UK says removing checks on goods and animal and plant products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are necessary to safeguard peace. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK's stance was "going to destabilise what is already a difficult situation".
