One of the trademarks of British summertime, Wimbledon, returns on Monday as players on the ATP and WTA Tours enter the third Grand Slam of the 2022 tennis season. Day One doesn't disappoint, with three eye-catching games set for Centre Court and 61 other matches taking place across the All England Lawn Tennis Club. Novak Djokovic begins what could be his second and final Grand Slam campaign of the year against Kwon Soon-woo - kicking off the action on Centre Court from 1.30pm. Uncertainty over the top seed's US Open status looms as his Covid vaccination row continues, so he's under pressure to deliver a seventh title in SW19 this year. Emma Raducanu will look to put her continued injury woes to one side against Alison Van Uytvanck in her Centre Court debut. She returns to Wimbledon as the 10th seed in the women's draw after winning the nation's hearts as a wildcard in last year's tournament. JUST IN: Emma Raducanu opens up on 'surreal' Wimbledon hype and pressure Andy Murray is the final headline act of Wimbledon Day One, facing Australian James Duckworth. He'll hope to continue his promising form on the grass after reaching the Stuttgart Open final earlier this month, narrowly losing to Matteo Berrettini in three sets. Elsewhere, British No 1 Cameron Norrie starts his Championships campaign against Spaniard Pablo Andujar. Wildcard Ryan Peniston is also among those looking to impress on home soil. Express Sport runs through the full Wimbledon order of play on Day One.
