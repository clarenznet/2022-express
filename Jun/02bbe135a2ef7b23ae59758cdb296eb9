During his interview, The One Show aired a clip of Matt making a startling discovery about one of his ancestors. Matt found out his ancestor had lived with Otto Frank and his family. His ancestor, therefore, knew Otto’s daughter the infamous Anne Frank. The One Show host Lauren remarked: “My heart was in my mouth watching you take in that information. “That’s just one of the things you find out about your grandmother and your wider family story. “How are you feeling about it now because it must have taken a while to process?” DON'T MISSAlex Jones almost falls off chair after joking she'd be 'fired' [VIDEO]Bargain Hunt’s Caroline shares £2 item which sold for thousands [INSIGHT]‘We had it out’ Roman Kemp details Soccer Aid row with Usain Bolt [INTERVIEW] Matt replied: “It’s a tragic story there is happiness with my grandmother and the life she found. “She met my [grandfather] and had two wonderful grandchildren.” Interjecting, Matt’s mum Diana quipped: “And a wonderful daughter.” “We’re a very modest family,” Matt joked. “But learning about what happened to her cousins, to her aunts and uncles is really upsetting. “But the thing was I never knew their names and I never knew what happened to them” “There was a vague sense that she had family that perished in the Holocaust but I never knew who and how,” the comedian continued. “This documentary allowed me to learn that and honour them.” The One Show airs on BBC One on weekdays at 7pm.
