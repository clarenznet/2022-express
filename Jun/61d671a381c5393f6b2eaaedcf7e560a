Levi Cull, 25, drove 60mph on the wrong side of the road, ran a red light and crashed, sending another vehicle into a parked car. A court heard Cull had attempted to flee police in the moments before the smash, which led to the Mercedes striking a fence, another car, flipping and eventually landing on its roof. The motorist, who has 10 convictions for 26 offences, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, driving without a licence and driving without insurance, Manchester Evening News reports He was jailed for 14 months but, when sentenced, he, via a video link, said: "Thank you very much you absolute helmet. In a bit mate." Sitting at Bolton Crown Court, The Honorary Recorder of Bolton Judge Martin Walsh indicated Cull will be brought back before a judge for contempt of court, meaning he could have his sentence increased. Police had spotted Cull driving on March 21. The defendant "attempted to duck his head" before turning down a side street away from police. A chase ensued through Bolton, Greater Manchester, before the dangerous driver crashed the Mercedes. Nick Ross, defending, said: "The defendant has recognised that he has a lot of growing up to do. He holds his hands up." Mr Ross added that the vehicle was not stolen and there were no "serious injuries" to anyone despite the crash being "dramatic". Cull, of Bolton, was also banned from driving for three years by the judge.
