Former surfing champion and Stradbroke Island local Russell Specht recalled his nephew’s close miss with the beast. He has urged tourists of the Queensland, Australia, beach to be careful of the hidden dangers as thousands of whales migrate to the east coast.   He said his lifeguard nephew Logan had a “really close call” while surfing and posted an aerial photo of the shark. In an Instagram post, Mr Specht wrote: “He had to put the board between him and a big white. “He thought it was over. “I had to post something as too many tourists just have no idea.” READ MORE: Kate and William's new Windsor home laid bare near frail Queen The Queensland local also advised beachgoers where it is safer to enjoy days in the sun.

Mr Specht captured a sobering image of the ferocious shark and posted it on his instagram. He wrote: “Hi just to let a few crew know these guys follow the whales. This was Saturday with about 30 crew in the water at Frenchman’s.”
