Princess Anne, 71, attended Royal Ascot today for the second day in a row. The royal wore a silver dress coat with a matching eccentric full-brim hat. Anne's hat had a massive flower attached to the side, which sprung out from the shape of a bow.  But it was the Princess Royal's brooch that stole the show.
