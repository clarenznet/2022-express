Her Majesty is not expected to head to the Ascot racecourse today, it is understood. The 96-year-old monarch also missed the first day of the much-anticipated event, which officially open on Tuesday. The Queen's absence from the racecourse may be linked to the episodic mobility issues she has been experiencing since last autumn. These health woes have forced the monarch to pull out of a number of key events, including the Commonwealth Day service in March and the State Opening of Parliament in May. Most recently, the monarch chose not to attend the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, held as part of the celebrations for her Platinum Jubilee on June 3, after having experienced "some discomfort" on the prior day. On the first day of Royal Ascot, the Queen spoke to racegoers via a message included in the event's programme. Her statement pointed out how important this edition of the Ascot races is, as it marks the first time since 2019 it can be held with a full attendance. She wrote: "I am delighted to welcome you to the first Royal Ascot with a full attendance since 2019. "After the challenges of recent times, this year's Royal Meeting provides a long-awaited opportunity for supporters of racing from all over the world to come together for five days of outstanding sport. "Once again, it is thrilling that horses from around the globe have travelled to Royal Ascot to compete at the highest level." MORE TO FOLLOW
