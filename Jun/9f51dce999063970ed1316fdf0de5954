It was briefly occupied by Russian troops in April. Valery, a farmer, said: “They stole trucks and many other things. They took everything from village shops and destroyed them. “They didn’t let civilians go inside and live in their houses, they parked armoured vehicles in the school, and in the backyards. “For at least a week, they occupied us and arrested anyone who fought back. In this village, they didn’t kill anyone. But in nearby villages they shot at civilians,” he claimed. The 61-year-old said he is concerned the Russians may return. He said: “When we tried to plant crops, we heard rockets overhead. I am very worried and I pray to God they don’t come back.” The port of Mykolaiv, 22 miles away, has seen both sides exchange artillery fire since the war began and Russia has occupied the nearby city of Kherson. Yet unlike the devastation in Bucha, near Kyiv, Marivka is shaken but not shattered. Irya, 52, another resident, said: “The Russians lived everywhere; in the cemetery, backyard, farms and in front of my house. They asked me to live in my house, and I said, ‘No, please, I have kids’. “We are afraid, but we don’t want to move or go out of our country. We are Ukrainians. We want to live here. We believe in our forces.” If Russia were to occupy Mykolaiv and then the port of Odessa, Moscow would take control of the entire Black Sea coast, crippling Ukraine’s overseas trade. Ivan Verstyuk, a Ukrainian analyst and blogger, said: “It’s critically vital for the Ukrainian army to defend the city of Mykolaiv from Russian invasion as it’s an important infrastructure hub.”
