Sergeant John Coutts and seven other men crawled for two hours down a tiny sewer in scenes akin to the classic 1994 film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Despite being stuck twice, he managed to wriggle free and eventually reached an open sewer hatch a few hundred yards outside the perimeter of the German PoW camp in Greece. It was such an arduous and claustrophobic route that two of them passed out due to a lack of air. The escapees split up and Sgt Coutts teamed up with two others to plot a safe passage to Turkey. But they soon both died, one due to malaria and the other through exhaustion. Sgt Coutts spent a winter hiding in a hillside hut, then met up with two other escapees. They made four attempts to reach Turkey by boat, eventually succeeding in May 1942. His escape earned him a Military Medal for gallantry with his citation extolling his “sheer dogged courage”. Later in the war, he added a bar to the award for leading a counter-attack in Normandy, weeks after the D-Day landings. His platoon was peppered with grenades before Sgt Coutts killed four Germans with a Bren gun. He was wounded but, showing a “complete disregard for his personal safety”, refused to leave his position until they were clear of the area. The medals sell with London auctioneers Noonans on June 29.
