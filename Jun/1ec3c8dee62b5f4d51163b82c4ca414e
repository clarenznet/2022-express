The US President arrives in Madrid on Tuesday for the NATO Summit, after completing the G7 Summit in the German Alps. He is expected to make a number of announcements over the coming days, including significantly bolstering the alliance's defense posture along its eastern edge, in addition to ramping up troops and heavy equipment. The announcements expected over the course of the two-day summit would harden the group's defenses as concerns grow that Putin could extend his war into other European countries such as the Baltics. The meeting comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed for more advanced weapons as Russian troops pivoted to long-range attacks. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
