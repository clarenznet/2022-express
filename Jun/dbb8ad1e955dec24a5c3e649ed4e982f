Claudia Winkleman, 50, looked great in a black and white look as she smiled for pictures at the Paramount+ dinner in London. She was accompanied by her husband and film producer, Kris Thykier, 50, who looked dapper in a grey suit. Claudia cut a casual look in a long-sleeved black and white striped top and fitted black trousers. She accessorised with gold jewellery and a small black clutch bag, along with her regular signature smokey-eye make-up. Her signature black tresses were worn bone straight as she cosied up to her husband on the black carpet. This comes as the Strictly Come Dancing presenter recently opened up about the "horrendous" farewell she had to give to her eldest son earlier this year. Speaking to the Radio Times, she revealed: "I apologise for all of it in advance. "Maybe itâ€™s also because my eldest has left home. Horrendous. And my little one is older and more independent." Claudia and her husband, Kris, share three children, Jake, 19, Matilda, 16, and Arthur, 10.
