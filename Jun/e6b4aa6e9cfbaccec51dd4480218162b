Paris Jackson, 24, had just finished an intense performance with her band when she strode out of New York City's Mercury Lounge in a deep orange dress. She layered the loose mini dress over a brown vest top, and tied a plaid shirt around her waist, while throwing on a rust orange knitted cardigan to complete her look. The sombre looking star accessorised with nude-coloured fishnet tights and a pair of black Dr Martens boots. She had worn a similar dress for her performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday, where she performed her new single Lighthouse. Following in her late father's footsteps in the music industry, her song paid tribute to the late Nirvana rocker Kurt Cobain.
