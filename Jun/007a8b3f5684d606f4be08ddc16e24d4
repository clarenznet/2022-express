Elsa Pataky, 45, made sure to steal the limelight away from her Hollywood husband as she took to the red carpet in a very revealing dress. The mother of three posed up a storm in a white dress featuring a plunging neckline and a daring thigh high split. She accessorised with stunning statement gold jewellery and matching platform heels. The actress went braless for the event and wore her brunette tresses in loose waves. Meanwhile, Thor star Chris Hemsworth, 38, looked dapper in a three-piece blue suit, a light blue dress shirt and brown loafers. Thor: Love and Thunder also stars Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Christian Bale and Matt Damon. It is the fourth film in the Thor franchise, and sees Thor go up against the villainous Gorr the God Butcher, played by Christian Bale.
