The Windsor Flower Show is part of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations and featured garden displays, floral arrangements and a celebration cake. For the garden visit, Sophie opted for a colourful floral dress. The navy midi dress is the Etro Allover Exotic Floral-print Silk Dress. The design is currently sold out but it retailed for £2,009.
