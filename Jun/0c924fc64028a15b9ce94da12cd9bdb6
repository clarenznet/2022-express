The veteran actor, 72, admitted he was in such agony at one point that: “I was in surrender mode. I was ready to go. The doctors kept telling me, ‘Jeff, you’ve got to fight. You’re not fighting.’” The Big Lebowski star said that he battled for breath, shook uncontrollably and was in “extreme pain” after contracting Covid in January 2021. He and his wife Susan, 69, became so ill they shared an ambulance to hospital. Susan was later allowed home. After weeks of agony, Jeff finally started to respond when doctors gave him “convalescent plasma”, a therapy that uses blood transplants from sufferers who have recovered. Now well on the mend, he added: “Covid made my cancer look like nothing.” The star has been in remission since last September and is now acting again.
