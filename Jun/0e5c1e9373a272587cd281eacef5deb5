The Duke of Cambridge has been embroiled in a well-documented rift with the Duke of Sussex, with friends reportedly claiming relations between the brothers are still at "rock bottom". William is also said to still be angry with his wife as he thinks she was "massively disrespected" by the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan told the US talk show host during her and Harry's explosive interview in March last year that it was Kate that made her cry before her royal wedding, after previous reports it was the other way around. A source told the Daily Mail: "William alternates between grieving for what he has lost and feeling really, really angry about what his brother has done. "He truly loves Harry and feels he has lost the only person, aside from his wife, who understood this strange life of theirs. "But he believes there are things you just donâ€™t do. And Harry has 100 percent crossed that line." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
