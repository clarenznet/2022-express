Pamela Anderson, 54, looked phenomenal as she posed with her then-husband Tommy Lee, 59, in a series of unearthed pictures. The former couple put on a loved-up display as they attended the 1996 American Music Awards together a year after they tied the knot. For the star-studded event, Pamela donned a sparkly silver spaghetti strap mini-dress and matching platform sandals. The Baywatch star chose to wear her blonde locks in her staple voluminous style. Tommy paired a purple velvet shirt with some leather trousers, and accessorised the look with silver chains and sunglasses. The pair could be seen in unearthed pictures sharing a passionate kiss and holding hands throughout the event. Pamela and Tommy were married for three years following a whirlwind romance that saw them wed after just a few days of knowing each other.
