Laura Hamilton, 40, has taken to Instagram with snaps of herself taking a dip into the pool at Wyndham Kusadasi hotel and Spa. The TV presenter smiled for the camera as she was seen descending into the blue water.  The star was wearing a dark blue bikini which showed off her cleavage, as she balanced daringly on the pool ladder. She matched the outfit with a pair of square-shaped shades. Laura wrote in the caption: “Vitamin-Sea. There is so much to see in and around Kusadasi. “Taking a boat trip along the coastline should definitely be on your list of thing to do if you are visiting.” In an earlier post from yesterday, the presenter shared a cheeky video of herself and a friend enjoying a “Turkish bath massage” at the hotel, which saw the pair being covered in soap and massaged by two men. She wrote: “Have you ever had a Turkish Bath Massage? It's somewhat of an experience and we feel clean and refreshed!”
