Madonna, 63, has taken to Instagram with more age-defying pictures of herself, showing the Vogue hitmaker posing while sitting on songwriter Jozzy's lap in her recording studio. The star could be seen in a zebra-striped shirt and blue sunglasses as she showed off her wrinkle-free visage. She attached the caption: “A woman’s work is never done”. The images were shared on the pop star’s story feature with her 18.2 million followers. She wore her outfit alongside her signature black fishnets and silver bangles to match. The star wore her blonde tresses straight and long while cheekily sucking her thumb for the camera.
