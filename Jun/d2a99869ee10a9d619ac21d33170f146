This is Kate's first appearance at the five-day event this year. She was seen wearing a high-neck polka-dot dress, while Prince William wore black tails with a grey waistcoat. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge surprised royal watchers with their attendance on the penultimate day of the races. Members of the Royal Family usually make appearances in the first three days of the five-day event. Prince Charles and Camilla attended the first two days of the event. On both days, they arrived at the event leading the Royal procession in the first carriage. They left an empty space in the carriage as a sign of respect for the Queen who was absent from the races. This comes amid her ongoing mobility issues. The 96-year-old monarch is a keen equestrian and it is understood she has been enjoying the races from the comfort of Windsor Castle. Kate and William also arrived at Ascot in the first carriage, leading the Royal Family at the prestigious event. This was unusual for the royal couple, who don't typically ride in the first carriage.  They were joined by the Hon Arthur George Vestey, whose elder brother is a close friend of the Duke and a fellow Old Etonian, and his wife Martha. Arthur is also the son of the Queen's friend and former Master of the Horse, Baron Samuel Vestey. Royal commentator Richard Eden described the decision to ride with the Vesteys as a "lovely gesture". He wrote on Twitter: "Lovely gesture by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to invite Arthur and his wife, Martha, to travel in their carriage.  "Arthur lost both his parents during the pandemic. "His father, Lord Vestey, would often ride in the Queen's carriage." Peter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne, also took part in the Royal procession at the races today. He sat in the second carriage with his girlfriend Lindsay Wallace, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Bedford.
