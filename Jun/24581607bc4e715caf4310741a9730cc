Phillip Schofield, 60, was spotted at Wimbledon with his wife Stephanie Lowe, 58 today. The This Morning presenter could be seen sharing a joke with his wife of 29 years, who also poured him a drink as they sat and watched the action together while joined by Holly Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin. Phil and Stephanie got married in 1993, but they split up in 2020 when the ITV star came out as gay. They share daughters Molly, 29, and Ruby, 26. Despite Phil moving out of the family home, the pair have no plans to legally divorce. "With divorce... that has not been discussed,” said Dancing on Ice host Phillip. “We are picking our way through and however that works and it’s a work in progress. I am a work in progress. Steph is a work in progress."
