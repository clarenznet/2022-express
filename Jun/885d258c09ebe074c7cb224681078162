The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the number of people out shopping across the UK last month was still lower than pre-coronavirus levels – down by 12.5 percent. But that is the lowest rate of decline in visitor numbers to bricks and mortar shops and malls since the pandemic hit – and the total is up by 0.6 percent from April. Overall, footfall has increased for the third month in row. High streets had the best improvement, with the rate of decline in visitors down 13.6 percent in May, a 3.6 percent improvement on April. In shopping centres it was down 26.7 percent, 0.9 points better than in April. However, footfall at retail parks dropped 6.3 percent – 2.3 percent worse than the previous month. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson attributed the overall improvement in footfall to people hitting the shops to find the best decorations and food and drink for the long Platinum Jubilee weekend. Better weather has helped too and, in London, the return of tourists after the easing of travel restrictions has also boosted shopper numbers. However, Ms Dickinson warned that the cost-of-living crisis could send footfall tumbling again. She said: “With UK discretionary incomes falling, government’s financial support to tackle surging energy costs may only provide temporary respite for households. “As inflation continues to climb and consumer confidence falls, it is by no means certain footfall will continue to improve over the coming months.” The BRC’s data was compiled by consultant Sensormatic Solutions. Its retail consultant, Andy Sumpter, said: “With households already starting to feel the pinch of the rising cost of living and growing inflationary pressures, retailers will be hoping that cracks don’t start to appear in the footfall recovery. “As they look ahead to June, retailers will be hoping that high streets will be rallied by the Jubilee weekend celebrations and that the event will prompt shopper traffic and retail spending.”
