Bloomberg journalist and trusted Apple insider Mark Gurman has teased what could be announced for iOS 16. Gurman in an article last weekÂ claimed that iOS 16 will be a "fairly significant" upgrade, and will bring with it one exciting feature. It's believed iOS 16 will significantly shake-up the iOS lock screen, with support for an always-on-display finally being added.  To complement this feature plenty of widgets will be available for iOS users to tailor-make their always-on-display. However, it's believed this feature will only be available for select models - the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Android users have long-enjoyed always-on-displays, with this feature a big selling point of the Samsung Galaxy S7. Expect plenty more upgrades to be revealed and we might even get to see some shiny new gadgets unveiled including a refreshed MacBook Air and the first sight of Apple's long-rumoured AR glasses.
