Ten fire engines and around 70 firefighters have been called to the blaze at flats above a shop on Chalk Farm Road in Camden. Part of the ground floor shop and most of a first-floor flat roof is alight.  Shocking video footage shows the fire engulfing the building above the Louis Coca shoe shop as plumes of black smoke billow into the sky. Residents were urged to keep their windows and doors closed because the fire is producing "heavy smoke". London's Fire Brigade said: "The Brigade was called at 12.07pm. Fire crews from Soho, West Hampstead, Paddington, Kentish Town and surrounding fire stations are at the scene.  "The cause of the fire is not known at this time." Control Officers recieved 36 calls to the blaze. Fire crews tweeted: "The fire in #Camden is producing heavy smoke. Local residents should keep their windows and doors closed. Please avoid the area whilst we work to make the scene safe." Eyewitness Daniel Bondoux was one of the people who alertes the fire brigade. Mr Bondoux, who works at a nearby bar, told MyLondon: "The fire caught on top of the shoe shop. There's an apartment behind it. "The fire moved to the shop to the left. The shop owner wasn't in. She saw it on CCTV. I don't think anyone was in there. I didn't see anoyone come out." This is the second major fire to hit the capital after a London bus was consumed by a huge fireball in Brixton.
