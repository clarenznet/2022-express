World number 12 Xander Schauffele has taken a swipe at the likes of Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau over their involvement in the controversial Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series. Six-time major winner Mickelson and former world number one Johnson were the two biggest stars involved in the inaugural LIV event which took place earlier this month in St Albans. Mickelson is reported to have been paid around $200m (£163.5m) to sign with LIV, while Johnson is said to have banked around $125m (£102m). Neither player managed to win the event though, with Charl Schwartzel coming out on top, Johnson finishing tied seventh and Mickelson ending up tied in 33rd place. JUST IN: Phil Mickelson hits fan with ball at US Open as others rush to his aid Former US Open winner DeChambeau, meanwhile, has committed to LIV's next event in Portland, Oregon in July. However, Schauffele has aimed a dig at Mickelson, Johnson, DeChambeau and Co, stating that he wants to compete against the "best players in the world, and they're on the PGA Tour". When asked at this year's US Open if he would consider jumping ship from the PGA Tour to LIV, Schauffele replied to Golf Magazine writer Dylan Dethier: "Honestly, I'm so happy. You actually asked me. You're the first one. "No. I'm not going. I want to play against the best players in the world, and they're on the PGA Tour. Nobody that has left has moved the needle for me."

"Nothing to tell from me," he said. "I want to do my best to beat all these guys. They're still here and as long as they're here, I'm not going anywhere. No chance. If I was 40? Maybe it would be different."
