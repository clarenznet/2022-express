Jessica Chastain, 45, made a dazzling appearance last night as she took the red carpet by storm at the 75th Annual Tony Awards. The actress opted for a show-stopping pink off-the-shoulder Gucci gown for the coveted event. She paired the floor-length dress with a bold red lip and her staple auburn locks styled in retro waves. The star-studded event took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and saw Jessica take to the stage to present.
