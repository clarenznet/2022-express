Andy Murray followed Emma Raducanu in crashing out of Wimbledon on day three after losing at the hands of John Isner on Centre Court. The Scot was vociferously backed by the partisan home crowd in attendance but was forced to leave SW19 with nothing to show for his efforts after going down in four sets. Murray played well for the majority of the contest but was simply unable to provide an answer to Isner's impeccable service game over the course of proceedings. The big-hitting American did not allow Murray to win a single break point and racked up a large number of aces on his way to victory in spite of the two-time Wimbledon champion's valiant performance. The result was ultimately decided by the only two break points of the match, which both went Isner's way in the first and fourth sets. The 37-year-old was just too strong for Murray, who gave everything after winning a third-set tiebreak but was eventually made to pay for his inability to respond to Isner's monstrous serves.
