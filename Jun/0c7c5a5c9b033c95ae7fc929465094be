Julia Fox, 32, flashed substantial underboob, as well as her derriere, in grey Alejandre chaps and a matching cut-out top selected by stylist Briana Andalore. It was a softer look for Julia, before she stepped out later that evening in a daring black head-to-toe leather look. “I think just being fearless, not giving a f***, doing what I feel like doing, and not caring about whether society thinks it's normal or not. If I think it's cool, then it's cool," the former flame of Kanye West told People last Thursday of her style. “I feel like I'm doing a service. I'm providing a service. Yeah, a visual service.” Julia's street sighting came the day before she revealed how she had creatively “upcycled” her mother's black bikini top with a $15 barbell she bought at Saint Marks Place in the East Village. “I broke the clasp on it so I went and found a piercing from Saint Marks. It was like $15,” she said.
