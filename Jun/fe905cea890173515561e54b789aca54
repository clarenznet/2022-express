The sale, allegedly without Pitt's knowledge, helped launch a "hostile" takeover of the wine business he had "carefully built" and forced him into partnership with a stranger, legal documents filed last week said. The couple, who have six children, have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle since Jolie filed for divorce in 2016. Now Pitt, 58, is suing Jolie, 47, over the Chateau Miraval estate in the South of France, where they wed in 2014. His lawyers have accused Maleficent star Jolie of "unlawful and tortious conduct" and are seeking a trial by jury. The former Hollywood power couple bought a Â£20.8million controlling stake in Chateau Miraval - a home and vineyard - in 2008. They married there in 2014. Lawyers for the Fight Club star said under his stewardship, the business grew into a "multimillion-dollar international success story". However, - they claimed Jolie had "contributed nothing". The documents, lodged at Los Angeles Superior Court, claim Jolie sold her stake in the vineyard to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian Yuri Shefler without Pitt knowing. It says: "Through the purported sale, Jolie sought to inflict harm on Pitt." "Jolie knew and intended that Shefler and his affiliates would try to control the business Pitt had built and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval."
