The Duke and Duchess of Sussex returned to the UK to celebrate the Queen's 70 years on the throne. Harry and William both attended the thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday but were not seen together at any other engagements. Nor did William and Kate's children get to meet Harry and Meghan's children Archie, three, and Lilibet, one, it has been reported. On Tuesday, the New York Post reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex invited William, Kate and their children to Lilibetâ€™s first birthday party at Frogmore Cottage on Saturday as an "olive branch", but the family did not attend.
