Players who have signed up to the inaugural LIV Golf Series event stand to make huge sums of money from the controversial tournament. Greg Norman's grand venture, which undoubtedly threatens the future of both the PGA and DP European Tours, kicks off with a 54-hole affair at The Centurion Club from June 9-11. The entry list was announced on Wednesday, and after it initially appeared like the field would be void of top stars, there was widespread shock when the name of two-time major champion Dustin Johnson appeared. Paul McGinley said the American's apparent climbdown, after he had previously pleaded allegiance to the PGA Tour, could "turn golf upside down." 'DJ' will be joined by the likes of Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter, and Lee Westwood, whilst there is still one big name, thought to be Phil Mickleson, to be revealed. The 51-year-old recently withdrew from the PGA Championships as the fallout from his apparent defection continues. The Saudi-backed event will hand out just short of £20 million in prize money to the 48 entrants, with £4 million of that designated to the three leading groups in the team competition. The leading individual will receive around £3.8 million - almost double what Justin Thomas received for winning the most recent major at Southern Hills.
