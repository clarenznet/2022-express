Amazon has slashed the Apple AirPods to the lowest ever price. The stylish wireless earbuds from Apple are the perfect companion for anyone that has picked up a new iOS device. AirPods currently cost £119 from the Apple Store, but Amazon UK shoppers can pick up the 'buds for £99 - that's one of the best AirPods deals we've ever seen! Amazon UK has sold the Apple AirPods for £99 – a £20 saving on its typical RRP – in the past, but it hasn't hit this record low price point for many months. In fact, the last time Amazon sold the AirPods for £99 was back in February, with the buds going back to full price after a limited-time sale ended. So, judging by past form the AirPods likely won't be available with this price £99 tag forever so you'll need to act quick to grab the deal. The AirPods come with a handy charging case that offers five hours of juice, which is ideal if you need to top up your battery while on the go. In total you'll be able to get up to five hours of listening time on a single charge and more than 24 hours when factoring in the battery life you get with the charging case.  If you have an Apple device already such as an iPhone 13 or MacBook then the AirPods will be able to easily and magically pair without any effort across multiple products. Elsewhere, the Apple AirPods offer easy access to the Siri voice assistant, which is perfect if you have a burning question pop into your mind and want an answer as quickly as possible. You can call upon the help of Siri simply by saying 'Hey Siri' out load, thanks to the AirPods built-in microphone which also allows you to make and receive calls without your phone in your hand.  AirPods give you quick controls while listening to music such as the ability to play or skip forward with a double tap. While the second generation AirPods are a popular choice, if you have a bigger budget you can opt for the more premium AirPods Pro. These wireless buds are available from Amazon UK right now for £189.99 instead of the regular £239.99. These buds offer a number of improvements over the regular AirPods including active noise cancellation, spatial audio, and interchangeable heads that provide a more comfy fit in your ears.
