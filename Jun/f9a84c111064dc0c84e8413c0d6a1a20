Jake and Logan Paul are among the highest-paid boxers of all time according to a recent study. Even when adjusted to inflation value the Paul brothers rank among the top 10 highest combined boxing purses of all time, which was topped by the Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in 2015. Logan comes in at No 5 on the list after his exhibition bout with Mayweather in 2021 with a jaw-dropping combined purse of £76,958,000 including inflation value. And younger brother Jake was not far behind, ranking at No 6 with £66,858,000 for his fight with NBA player Nate Robinson in 2020. The only fights to top the brother’s blockbuster paydays were Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield 2, Mayweather vs Conor McGregor, Roberto Duran vs Sugar Ray Leonard 2, and Mayweather vs Pacquiao. The study by Parimatch uses inflation rates to calculate what original purses would be like in the modern-day in order to compare the value of classic fights. Jack Dempsey’s 1927 bout against Gene Tunney originally had a purse valued at £1,447,500 but would be worth £21,686,111 today in line with a 976.34% inflation rate over the past 95 years.
