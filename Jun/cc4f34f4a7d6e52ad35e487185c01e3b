  Denise, 64, showed off her holiday tan in some bright red swimwear, which included a low neckline and frills around the bust. She accessorised with a large pair of shades to keep the sun out of her eyes as she posed on a lounger. In the caption she wrote: “First time to Croatia and it’s beautiful. “Here to see @healytymd but I probably will only be allowed one photo!!! “Thank you Kevin @norsemantravel for organising, thank you @ryanair for perfect flight on time and @amadriaparkopatija for your welcome and hospitality. All paid for just grateful #amadriapark.” (sic)
