Antonia Mendoza Chavez's body, along with those of her pets, were found on Wednesday morning. Ms Chavez was understood to have been walking her dogs on the same trail she used every day. CCTV footage shows her earlier that morning as she headed out from her home with the dogs. Police and paramedics were pictured at the scene, with emergency vehicles parked alongside a grass embankment. Emergency services were called to the area of Rimbank and Mines avenues, in Los Angeles County's Pico Rivera, around 8.50am local time (4.50pm BST). Pico Rivera City Manager Steve Carmona warned local residents to stay indoors amid the stormy weather. He said: "We should all be cautious with this activity that's in the area. "We want everybody to be careful. There's a lot of instability in the air. Just be careful and do your best to stay indoors at this time."
