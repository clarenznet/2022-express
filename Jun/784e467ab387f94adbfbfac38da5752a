Britt Ekland and fellow actor Peter Sellers married in 1964 - but within just a couple of months of their wedding day, he succumbed to a heart attack. Wasting no time in helping him recuperate, The Man with the Golden Gun actress Britt can be seen tenderly caressing and caring for her then-husband in a series of scarcely seen photos. These candid snaps were taken at the couple's home in the most exclusive area of Beverly Hills, California. The house had belonged to a Hollywood millionaire, Charles Skoras, and ex Vice President Richard Nixon was once among their neighbours in these elite surroundings. Peter seemed to be recovering well under the watchful eye of his seductive wife.
