Shoppers with a Boots rewards card are being urged to check if they have used their card within the last year. If the Boots Advantage card has been used at least once in the last year, shoppers will be keeping their points. However, if customers haven't used their loyalty card in the last 12 months, it needs to be used before next Monday, June 20. Otherwise, they risk losing all their points. The rewards card can be used at a Boots store or online at boots.com.

This is because Boots closes loyalty card accounts if they haven't been used in a whole year. All customers need to do is scan their Advantage card within the next week when buying any item at Boots.  They don't have to spend their points, but just make sure the card is scanned. Before this change, Boots Advantage card holders only had to ensure their card was scanned once every two years. A Boots spokesperson explained: "Thank you for being one of our valued Boots Advantage Card members. "Whilst it won’t impact you as a regular Boots shopper, we need to let you know that we’re updating our Boots Advantage Card terms and conditions. "This is instead of the current two-year period. "As long as you shop with your Boots Advantage Card at least once a year, your points will always be there ready for you to use them." The Boots loyalty card offers cardholders four reward points for every £1 spent in-store or online. Each point is worth 1p. When accumulated, points can be redeemed in-store and online. Shoppers can get a Boots Advantage card by signing up to the Advantage Card on the Boots app, or by subscribing for a Boots Advantage card in-store.
