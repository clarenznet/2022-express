Cat Deeley, 45, slipped into a bodycon black dress in a similar design to the one worn by supermodel Cindy Crawford in the 1990s. The presenter showed off her gorgeous figure in the thigh-skimming number that revealed her toned pins as she posed up a storm. The dress featured strap detailing with gold attachments reminiscent of Cindy's Versace dress, which the ageless presenter teamed with sky-high black heels. Cat wore her blonde tresses in perfectly styled waves over her shoulders and opted for a typically glamorous makeup look as she worked her best angles. She penned in her Instagram caption: "Today's #SYTYCD look!  Inspired by the Supers of the 90's and that one @Versace show! Channelling my inner @CindyCrawford, @HelenaChristensen, #KarenMulder and even a little #GeorgeMicheal 'Freedom' too!!! X."
