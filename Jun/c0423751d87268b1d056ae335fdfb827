After Sam spotted the stranded pair he told his parents, who then called 999 to alert the coastguard. Minutes later, St Agnes RNLI lifeboat was launched to help the two holiday makers on Star Beach near Trevaunance Cove. Volunteers were able to successfully bring the he pair back to shore and safety. Volunteer RNLI helm Rich Draisey told Cornwall Live said: "Star Beach is a classic cut-off spot because it is tucked in below the cliffs and people do not see that the tide has already come in around the corner. Thanks to Sam’s awareness and his parents’ timely call to the emergency services, we were able to bring the casualties safely to shore." Sam, pictured with the volunteer RNLI lifeboat crew who attended the incident, Amy Bucknole, Charlie Jenkins and Rich Draisey, said he is keen to develop his water safety skills. The schoolboy is also planning on joining St Agnes Surf Lifesaving Club this summer. Hearing of Sam's brave efforts online, people took to Cornwall Live's Facebook page to commend him. One user posted their praise, saying: "Well done Sam. Great quick thinking. Definitely averted what could have become a tragedy." Another user commented: "Omg well done sweetheart you're a hero xx" - a sentiment echoed amongst users. Other comments included: "Well done Sam, clever lad! X" "Well done Sam. You're a star" "Well done Sam, clever lad!" and that he was an "amazing little boy." You can find out more about the RNLI, and how to keep yourself and others safe this summer across the UK, via their website. St Agnes is a small beach enclosed by cliffs and rocks on both sides. At high tide there is no beach. Rocks separate St Agnes from Trevellas Porth (Star Beach). The RNLI website states that lifeguard patrol times for this beach are 10am-6pm from May 14 until September 25.
