Sir Robert Francis QC told MPs more than 50 percent of complaints from patients involved access to care. The chairman of Healthwatch England said: "They find it difficult to book appointments, they certainly find it difficult to have a face-to-face appointment with a GP when they feel that's what they need." GP time "There also have been issues about prescriptions, about getting referrals to the hospital and difficulties in registration, but it is mainly about access."  Sir Robert told the Commons Health and Social Care Committee patients are willing to see other primary care staff when appropriate but want to know who is coordinating their care. He said solutions must be found for staffing issues but remote consultations are "not a panacea for everyone".
