The latest victim first took notice of his symptoms after returning from his trip to Colombia in April. Within five days of his return, he experienced pain while urinating and discharge from his penis. After further tests confirmed he had gonorrhoea, he was given a standard course of antibiotics, which helped ease symptoms. The patient, however, still tested positive for gonorrhoea, suggesting the treatment had failed to rid the body of the infection.

The World Health Organisation previously warned that strains of super-gonorrhoea appeared to be resistant to nearly all classes of antibiotics. It is believed the disease has been developing resistance to antibiotics since the 1930s. The longer an infection is left untreated, the greater the risk of serious complications including infertility and potentially life-threatening bacterial infections of the blood. Gonorrhoea is currently the second most common sexually transmitted infection after chlamydia. In 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded a staggering 667, 769 cases in the country. The virus, which typically affects the urethra, cervix, rectum and throat, can cause wide-ranging symptoms. Alongside pain during urination, gonorrhoea usually causes rectal itching, bleeding or discharge. Patients often complain of pelvic or abdominal pain, or pain during bowel movements. If the virus presents in the throat, it will trigger a sore throat that may persist for weeks. MPs from the Science and Technology Committee were briefed on the threat posed by super-gonorrhoea and other superbugs earlier today. A lack of diagnosed tools is believed to be one of the issues driving the over-prescription of antibiotics in the UK, according to the experts.
