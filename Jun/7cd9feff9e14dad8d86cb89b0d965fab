Martin Lewis' wife Lara Lewington hastold how she's been covering up her scars with make-up, just days after having stitches in her face after falling off an electric scooter. Lara, 43, stunned in the fresh-faced snap which she shared with her 26,800 followers. She wrote: "Dinner @britishmuseum, what a venue and what a night. A brilliant get together of the @foundersforum crowd. "Met a lot of doctors (couldâ€™ve done with them a few weeks ago - although only a couple any good at medical treatment), tech founders, and generally interesting folk." Instagram uer Mel.clark.1293 commented: "Beautiful lady and polite. And check you. No scars. Xx." Lara replied: "Thank you, some very heavy make-up has unbelievably managed to cover them!"
