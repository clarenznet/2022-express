Those tuned into BBC Breakfast wasted no time in taking to social media to comment on the "car crash interview" between host Jon Kay and Dominic Raab. Kay questioned the MP on how Johnson is currently looking as his standards adviser has expressed there is a "legitimate question" over whether he broke the ministerial code after being fined over Partygate. "The fact that somebody as senior as you within the government is having to come out and defend the Prime Minister at this point during the parliamentary holidays suggests that Downing Street is a bit worried about his position, doesn't it?" asked Kay. "Oh I do rounds most weeks, so I wouldn't read too much into that," Raab insisted. "And of course, the last one before we get into the Jubilee, so I'm very happy to be here." He added: "But look, on the issue at hand, Lord Geidt has raised those concerns and the Prime Minister's responded in his letter. "He's explained that the breach of the law was not deliberate, was not intentional, it was inadvertent and that's why it was not a breach of the code. "At the same time in relation to Lord Geidt, since you're raising it, he's the independent advisor on the ministerial code, Number 10 have been working with him for months to reinforce and strengthen the role that he's got and I think it's welcome that that's been concluded because it is an important piece in the transparency and accountability architecture." "It doesn't sound like Lord Geidt thinks that it is concluded though, does it?" Kay pointed out.
