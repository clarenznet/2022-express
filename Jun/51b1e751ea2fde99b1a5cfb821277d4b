Amanda Holden, 51, looked sensational as she sported a sixties-inspired psychedelic two-piece. The satin outfit looked great, with a pink crossbody bag drawing in the Britain's Got Talent's judges petite frame. She styled the bold number with yellow heels and large white framed sunglasses. Amanda styled her signature blonde tresses in a straight ponytail, leaving her large gold hoops on full display. The TV personality is known for her rebellious fashion, having even received Ofcom complaints for her cleavage-baring choice of outfits on Britain's Got Talent.
