Joan Collins, 89, declared today Way Back Wednesday as she posted a photo of herself enjoying the Silver Jubilee party back in 1977. Tagging Jane Seymour, Samantha Eggar and Juliet Mills, she shared a snap of the four of them sitting beside each other clutching Union Jack flags for the special moment. Joan's post comes just hours before the street parties begin for the Queen's Platinum celebrations. The leggy snap, featuring a jubilant Joan grinning for the camera, was a hit with her fans.  Almost 2,000 of her 277,000 followers spotted it within a few hours and invited nostalgic conversation as they reminisced on the Silver Jubilee. "Oh god wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just hold time for us all and have everyone we love still here and hold time in great chapters of life," @colinsmithvisual wrote. "Here we are 45 years later and about to celebrate this weekend for her Majesty's 70th year - amazing really. ".So excited to see you in the big parade Dames in Jags. And lm sure you will look absolutely stunning you always do beautiful Joan.," (sic) they ended their comment.
