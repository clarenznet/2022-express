Naomi Campbell, 52, oozed confidence as the British icon opted to go braless beneath a seasonal tropical print shirt during her latest appearance at Paris Fashion Week today. The supermodel attended the Louis Vuitton menswear show unveiling their Spring-Summer 2023 collection at the opulent Cour Carr√©e of the Louvre. The mum-of-one added a pair of matching lilac trousers as she chose to keep the eye-catching shirt unbuttoned as she joined a selection of guests. She accessorised with a pair of sunglasses and kept her long tresses immaculately styled with a middle parting.
