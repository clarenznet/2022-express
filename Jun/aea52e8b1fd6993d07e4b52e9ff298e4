A shortlist of 10 will be drawn up from your suggestions for the VIP you believe has triumphed over adversity or given outstanding help to others. Then you can vote to narrow it down to four finalists and the eventual winner. Among those in the running so far are Kate Garraway and Derek Draper for their heart-warming battle against his long-term Covid, Deborah James, for her inspirational work to raise awareness of bowel cancer and funds for research, and Judge Robert Rinder for his mission to rescue 50 orphans from Ukraine. Chairman of the judging panel, Falklands War hero Simon Weston, said: "We are calling on Daily Express readers to choose celebrities they feel deserve the accolade of celebrity of the year."
