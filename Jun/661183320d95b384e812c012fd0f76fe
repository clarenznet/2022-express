The Chancellor told MPs in the House of Commons this morning that the Northern Ireland Protocol meant that ministers in Westminster were unable to provide the same help to those in the province as the rest of the UK. Earlier this year Mr Sunak slashed VAT on materials used to help with insulation of houses, in a bid to help ease energy bills. He argued the measures would help reduce the cost for families to make sure their homes were energy efficient, lowering the cost of heating the house. But the Northern Ireland Protocol's current terms mean VAT rules remain set by the EU, with the Government unable to help provide the tax cut to those in Northern Ireland. "As I said from this dispatch box at the time of the Spring Statement, we were unable to extend our VAT cut on energy-saving materials to Northern Ireland because of some of the provisions of the Protocol," Mr Sunak said this morning in response to a question from DUP MP Sammy Wilson. Northern Ireland effectively remains in the EU single market under the terms of the 2019 Brexit withdrawal agreement. It means that the UK Government does not have permission to alter certain rules and regulations without the permission of Brussels. The stance enraged Unionists, who argue the integrity of the single market is being undermined by the Protocol's implementation. Mr Wilson argued in the Commons this morning: "Many of the fiscal levers that the Government could use to support Northern Ireland are, of course, not available because of the fact we are under the VAT regime of the EU, and we are still subject to EU state aid rules which would rule out many of the measures the Government would take." Mr Sunak promised Mr Wilson this morning that new legislation passed in the House of Commons last night would finally allow ministers to take action on VAT. He said: "He will know the legislation we've put in front of this House, and I'm glad it received support last night, will address exactly those issues." More to follow...
