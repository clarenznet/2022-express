The Duke of Cambridge does not see his once close brother in the future of the Royal Family, according to royal commentator Richard Eden. Commenting on claims Prince William has moved on from the row with the Duke of Sussex, the Daily Mail Diary Editor said he believes this doesn't mean there has been some healing to their relationship, reportedly damaged by Megxit - the Sussexes' decision to step back as senior royals. Rather, he said he believes the future King considers his younger brother "almost someone from his past". Appearing on the Mail+'s Palace Confidential programme, Mr Eden said: "Essentially, Harry is almost someone from his past. "It sounds brutal and it is sad but Harry is not part of the future that William envisages and he is almost irrelevant to that. "And we saw that in a pretty stark way at the Jubilee celebrations I think." Prince Harry and Meghan Markle travelled back to the UK earlier this month to take part in the celebrations for the Queen's historic Platinum Jubilee. While this trip had raised hopes it could help mend the widely reported rift between the Dukes, Prince William and Prince Harry were never publicly seen interacting during the extended bank holiday weekend, leading to think their relationship continues to be strained.
