The Devon Air Ambulance was dispatched too. The Health and Safety executive are investigating the accident after reports that a fire started after a worker was drilling and hit the mains electricity. One witness told Devon Live: "The mains cable was supposed to be half a metre down but it was just below the surface. It was horrific."

In a statement today, Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed: "Police were contacted by the ambulance service at around 5:45pm on Thursday 17 June who were at the scene of a workplace incident on The Strand in Torquay. "It is believed that a man who was working at the site of the former Boots store was injured and sustained serious, potentially life-changing burns; He was subsequently air-lifted to hospital for treatment where he remains. "Police continue to liaise with partners including Fire and are due to hand this matter over to the Health and Safety Executive for investigation."
