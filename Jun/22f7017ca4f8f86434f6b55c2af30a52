Calls for Scotland to cut ties with the Monarchy have been growing on social media as the Queen's four-day Platinum Jubilee celebrations begin with the pomp and pageantry at the Trooping the Colour ceremony this morning. Scots labelled those celebrating “plastic patriots” and fumed that celebrating the Queen’s momentous milestone was a “farce”.  While many argued Scotland could not become independent if it was led by the Royal Family. This comes despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is desperate to rip Scotland from the Union, congratulating the Queen on a "lifetime of service" ahead of her Platinum Jubilee. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the Queen had played an "integral role" in the story of modern Scotland and said it was no surprise the occasion was to be celebrated so widely.  And she urged all Scots to mark Her Majesty's "values of integrity, wisdom, justice and compassion" - regardless of their views on the institution of the British monarchy. But Scots on Twitter were less than impressed. Artisans17 tweeted: “You’re going to be all triumphant and plastic patriot about the jubilee for the next few days ………….I predict.

SaltireBlack added: “The Jubilee is an abomination.  “Celebrating the richest woman on the planet is obscene when so many are having to choose between heating and eating. “Now is not the time to worship the aristocracy when so many are struggling to live. #ScottishRepublic” After 70 years of service for the country and Commonwealth, thousands of well-wishers will take to the streets over the extended bank holiday weekend to mark the monarch's milestone. The once in a lifetime event will see members of the monarchy, celebrities from the UK and across the globe, and people from all parts of the UK gather to recognise the Queen's legacy.
