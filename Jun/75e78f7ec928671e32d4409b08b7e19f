Lady Victoria Hervey stunned in a daring, cut-out outfit as she attended The Grand Prix Ball at The Hurlingham Club last night. The socialite, 45, cut a glamorous figure in the structured navy number which featured fitted, flared trousers on the bottom and revealing waistcoat on top. Turning to the side to give a view of her outfit, Victoria flashed a large side of her flank thanks to the revealing design of the garment. Walking the red carpet ahead of the event, Victoria smiled as she posed experly for snaps. The model wore her blonde tresses in perfect curls which fell across the large, structured collar and boasted a glowing complexion and fresh face of natural-looking make-up.
