Former US Army staff sergeant James Vasquez said the Russians "have bounties on his head" following his previous tour of duty in Ukraine. Mr Vasquez said he has sold all of his belongings and is going to return to Ukraine to fight against Putin "twice as hard". In a video posted on Twitter, he said: “Don’t insult me with a $50,000 (over £40,000) bounty. Go big or go home, Russian clowns. “When I get back I’ll take that money from you in five minutes with the next assault vehicle I take from you. Don’t waste my time. “I’m selling my house and everything I own. I’m returning to Ukraine to fight the rest of the war. Then after I’m rebuilding Ukraine.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
