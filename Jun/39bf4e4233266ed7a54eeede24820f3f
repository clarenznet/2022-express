Today is the final day of Royal Ascot 2022 and guests are out in full force wearing glamorous outfits and wacky hats. The temperature in Ascot, Berkshire is currently 24 degrees but that didn't stop one racegoer from wearing a huge, white fluffy hat. The hat was so large that it actually covered the spectator's face. She paired this wacky hat with a statement pearl necklace and a white ensemble. Another racegoer sparkled in a floor-length silver gown.

Of course she paired this dress with a fabulous fascinator, in keeping with the Royal Ascot dress code. This fascinator comprised silver feathers to match her glorious gown and caramel hued feathers which complemented her hair. One guest went for a wide-brimmed hot pink feathered hat. Another turned heads in an enormous electric blue hat, again covered in feathers. She paired this with a plunging purple below-the-knee dress, featuring blue, purple and pink flowers. The racegoer donned a pair of criss cross strappy purple sandals to tie the outfit together. Walking in with her was another racegoer in a more modest - but still head-turning - white number. She opted for a fitted white dress with a yellow flower detail. On her head she wore a white cartwheel hat boasting a bouquet of pale yellow flowers. Floral was a big theme at today's festivities.
