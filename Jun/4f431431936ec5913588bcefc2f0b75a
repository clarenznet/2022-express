Richmond Primary School in Hinckley, Leicestershire, made the announcement ahead of the event which was due to take place tomorrow (June 17). Children were set to be joined by parents and carers in the afternoon for a series of competitive races, but the predicted temperatures have put a stop to that. Weather forecasters are predicting highs of 30 degrees for the region on Friday, reports Leicestershire Live. The school said the decision had been made with the children’s welfare in mind. The event will take place later this month, however, some sports events will still take place in the morning tomorrow before the temperature rises too high. The school said: "Due to the hot weather, we have made the decision to postpone the Years 4,5 and 6 afternoon competitive races where parents and carers were invited to attend. "Sorry for the inconvenience but we feel it will be too hot for the children who are not used to these temperatures." While the afternoon’s events are cancelled, the school has made clear that Friday morning will see team events take place. This will be while temperatures are expected to sit in the low 20s before peaking at 29C or 30C at 4pm.  The school said the cancelled events will take place on Tuesday, June 28, while they’ve also issued key advice for children taking part in Friday morning’s team events. "Could we please ask that your child is supplied with a hat and has adequate sun protection (ideally applied before school)," they said. "If anyone has the use of spare gazebo we could borrow, that would be really appreciated." The hot weather is set to be short-lived, with temperatures dropping to 16 degrees at the weekend.
