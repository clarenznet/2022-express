Voters in Devon's Tiverton and Honiton and Yorkshire’s Wakefield constituencies will head to the polls on Thursday in what could be two hotly contested by-elections. Both Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson will be closely watching for the results - so will there be an exit poll? An exit poll is a survey that asks voters after they have voted at polling stations which candidate and/or political party they voted for. They are used to give a quick indication during a general election of who will win in that area - but they can often be wrong. It’s unlikely there will be an official exit poll for a single constituency election, given that results will likely be available quickly, most likely in the early hours of Friday morning. These two by-elections have been triggered after the resignation of two MPs in April and May of this year. Former Conservative MP for Wakefield Imran Ahmad Khan was jailed for 18 months for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. After being expelled from the Tory party, Mr Khan was still in Parliament as an Independent MP when he stood down following his conviction. In Tiverton and Honiton, Tory MP Neil Parish stood down after he was twice caught looking at pornography on his phone in parliament. He admitted the first instance was an accident but that the latter was deliberate. Mr Parish left the Commons on May 4 after admitting his behaviour was “totally wrong”, after representing the constituency for 12 years. Mr Parish was a popular figure in the area, winning with a majority of 24,000 at the general election in 2019. In Tiverton and Honiton: In Wakefield:
