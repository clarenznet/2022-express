Clinching the title will bring £700million and create 3,000 jobs in the city with the UK's youngest population, the team behind the winning bid said. Ms Dorries said: "Art and culture should be accessible to everyone and this prestigious title will help Bradford deliver unforgettable events for communities on their doorstep." "There was stiff competition and I thank County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham County Borough for their excellent bids." The designation is awarded to cities every four years, Coventry being the current City of Culture. Bradford will receive £275,000 in initial funding as it develops its plans for 2025. This grant will help pave the way for a year of "unforgettable cultural activities and events", the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the win. He said: "This title builds on the rich history and dynamism of the city, bringing investment and opportunity for everyone who lives and works there." Ten judges, headed by Brookside, Grange Hill and Hollyoaks creator Sir Phil Redmond, visited the city earlier this month. Sir Phil said: "The selection is never about whether one bid is better than another. It is more that one bid has the potential to make a bigger and deliverable impact." "For 2021 we asked Coventry to raise the bar previously set by Derry-Londonderry 2013 and then raised by Hull 2017. Challenged by the pandemic, Coventry has certainly done that and I am looking forward to seeing how far the cultural bar can be raised [in 2025]." Bradford's bid drew on its cultural assets including the Bronte Parsonage, the industrial village of Saltaire - a Unesco World Heritage Site - and the National Science and Media Museum. The runners-up will receive £125,000 to help push ahead with the most exciting elements of their bid. Eilish McGuinness, of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: "We look forward to the exciting opportunities it will bring to the people of Bradford."
