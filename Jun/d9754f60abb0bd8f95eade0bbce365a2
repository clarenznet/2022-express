  The Britain’s Got Talent judge stunned in the summery lace adorned ensemble, which was complete with some cute puff sleeves. The dress was decorated with layers of frills that started below Amanda’s waist and finished at her feet. The garment was asymmetrical in design, allowing the star to flash her tanned legs as she walked along the street. Amanda accessorised the outfit with some open-toed, brown high heels, a matching pink purse, and some dark sunglasses.
