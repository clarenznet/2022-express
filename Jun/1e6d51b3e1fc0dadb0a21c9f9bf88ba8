Meghan Markle dazzled in a navy outfit with a matching white hat with a blue ribbon, while Harry wore a smart suit for the historic royal occasion. The Duchess appeared in a playful mood as she joked with younger royals. Prince Harry and Meghan are believed to have arrived in the UK last night to join other members of the firm for the first official Jubilee event. Commentators have suspected whether Harry and Meghan would attend in the weeks leading up to the milestone event. However, the entire Royal Family are in attendance at the parade - with the exception of Prince Andrew.

There will then be a procession back to Buckingham Palace featuring royals in carriages, and finally the iconic balcony appearance. However, Prince Harry and Meghan won't be joining other members of the family on the balcony. It comes after Buckingham Palace previously announced that only working royals would be featured on the Palace terrace.  The appearance at the Jubilee event is the couple's first joint public appearance with the Royal Family since they quit as working royals nearly two years ago. As they were unable to attend the balcony, the pair are believed to have watched the Trooping the Colour event with other royals from the Major General's office near Horse Guards parade. Their two children - Archie and Lilibet - accompanied them on their trip giving the Queen her first opportunity to meet her great-granddaughter, who turns one on Saturday. The monarch is understood to have sent a car and royal protection officers to collect the Duke and Duchess from Farnborough Airport and drive them to their home at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor earlier in the week.
