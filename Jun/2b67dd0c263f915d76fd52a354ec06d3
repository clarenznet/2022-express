The Formula One circus makes the gruelling trip from Azerbaijan to Canada this week following Max Verstappen's win in Baku on Sunday. The teams and drivers have a short turnaround until the next race this weekend on the other side of the globe. There had been doubts whether Lewis Hamilton would be able to race in Montreal due to Mercedes' porpoising issues causing him back pain. But the Briton has confirmed he will be back in the W13 this weekend, saying: "I've had acupuncture and physiotherapy and I'm on my way to my team to work with them on improving. We have to keep fighting. I'll be there this weekend - I wouldn't miss it for the world." That's despite Toto Wolff having described the seven-time world champion as doubtful due to the pain caused by Mercedes' problems. Hamilton could be seen slowly clambering out of his car after the Azerbaijan Grand Prix at the weekend. Verstappen's victory, and Charles Leclerc's DNF for Ferrari, saw the Dutchman open up a 21-point gap atop the Drivers' Championship standings. The Red Bull driver warned however: "To get a 1-2 for the team was really good, we’ve scored some good points today and made the gap bigger to Ferrari. There’s still a long way to go, it’s a long season so we need to keep pushing as a team." Express Sport rounds up all the latest Formula One news ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix below.
