 Paul McCartney has made an entrance alongside wife Nancy Shevell as the two were driven into Glastonbury festival for the musician’s warm-up gig. The pair arrived as Paul was dressed in a crisp blue shirt and black jean jacket. Meanwhile, Nancy wore her brunette tresses straight and long, as she opted for a dark red leather jacket in typical rocker fashion, alongside dangling golden earrings. Elsewhere at Glastonbury this year, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the crowd with a message of peace. “Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of the war...," he said. “Put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine.”
