This year's Wimbledon draw managed to throw up plenty of surprises ahead of the on-court action, which is set to get underway on Monday. Defending champion Novak Djokovic will begin his campaign against world No 75 Soonwoo Kwon, while Rafael Nadal will be tasked with downing Francisco Cerundolo in their first-round match-up at the All England Club. The two favourites for the title could meet in what would be an epic final at SW19. Andy Murray, who is unseeded, was handed an opening match against James Duckworth of Australia and could then face either Enzo Couacaud or John Isner in the second round if he is able to make it through. Ninth seed Cameron Norrie will begin his Wimbledon campaign against Spanish veteran Pablo Andujar, with Dan Evans set to face world No 98 Jason Kubler in the first round at SW19. Emma Raducanu, meanwhile, finds herself in the bottom half of the women's draw and will avoid top seed Iga Swiatek until the final if she manages to make it that far. The 19-year-old will go up against Alison van Uytvanck in what could be a tricky opening match against an established top 50 player, while Serena Williams was handed a tie against world No 113 Harmony Tan as she prepares to make her Grand Slam return after a year-long hiatus.
