In one snap Laura posed on a diving board, with an amazing backdrop of mountains. She captioned the post in view of her 158,000 Instagram followers: "When the house search is done it's time to find The Grotto with the diving board into the sea! "My house hunters this week have been a dream and so much fun to hang out with! @aplaceinthesunofficial #lisa #wayne." In another post, Laura showed off her adventurous side as she posed with a quad bike, flaunting her phenomenal figure and messy beach hair. She captioned the second post: "Corfu Quaddie!
