Katie Boulter feels a "very lucky girl" to have Alex De Minaur by her side as she bids for a deep run at Wimbledon. The 25-year-old defeated Clara Burel in her opening round match to set up a tough tie against last year's finalist Karolina Pliskova. Pliskova reached the Wimbledon final last year, losing to Ashleigh Barty in three sets having blitzed through the earlier rounds. For Boulter, she's never gone past the second round of Wimbledon in three main draw entries. But the Brit will be drawing on her result from last week while she admits boyfriend De Minaur has also been playing a key role this week. The Aussie tennis ace and Boulter have been dating for over a year now and De Minaur was on court for his girlfriend's first-round win over Burel. De Minaur is playing later in the day on Court One, giving him potentially some time to go on Centre and watch Boulter play. But it's his presence behind the scenes and own achievements in tennis which are inspiring Boulter to replicate that in her own career.

"No, yeah, he's someone that I have a lot of admiration for on and off the tennis court. "He is the epitome of a fighter and someone that goes out and gives their all every single day. That's what I aspire to be like. I feel like to have that around me and my team, it really helps me because I can push myself. He helps me do that. DON'T MISS  "I'm a very lucky girl." Boulter may well be torn for De Minaur's match though as the Aussie faces Jack Draper last on Court One. Draper impressed at Eastbourne last week which included wins over Diego Schwartzman and Jenson Brooksby. The 20-year-old is now at a career-high ranking of 94 having won an impressive four ATP Challenger titles this year already.
