Prince Andrew, the Queen’s second son, is trying to “arrange a comeback” after his scandal according to royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. He said the Duke of York is getting “nowhere” in his bid to return to royal duties and urged him to accept he has “no future public role”. He added that Andrew could find himself in a new role created by the Firm such as “managing the royal estates”. Andrew has reportedly asked his mother to reinstate his titles to allow him to attend official events again. He was stripped of his HRH status, military titles and royal patronages by the Queen in the face of a civil sexual assault case, one that was dropped after he reached an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Roberts Giuffre that his lawyers said was not an admission of guilt. Mr Fitzwilliams told Express.co.uk: “Andrew is in the background, though he is trying to arrange a comeback and it is getting him nowhere. “Indeed there is even more adverse publicity but public support is near zero. “He has to accept that, at 62, he has no future public role. The Royal Family have to create one for him, such as managing the royal estates.” Andrew stepped back from public duties following his Newsnight interview in November 2019 over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The Queen has indicated that she would like Andrew to rebuild his public life following allegations of sexual assault settled out of court, claims he has always strongly denied.  Andrew was due to attend Order of the Garter on Monday, June 13, with other members of the Royal Family. The Queen had approved his appearance but an eleventh-hour intervention from Prince Charles and Prince William meant he was restricted to private elements of the day. Both future Kings were reported to have expressed “significant unease” towards the inclusion of Andrew. So what do YOU think? Should Prince Andrew have a new role created for his ‘comeback’?
