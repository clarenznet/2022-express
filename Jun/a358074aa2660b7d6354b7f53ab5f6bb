The man, who can be seen wearing a DPD uniform, "delivered" the parcel on Wednesday morning (June 8). Jorja Hunt, who was expecting a food delivery box from HelloFresh between 7.55am and 8.55am, was appalled at the way it was delivered. The 24-year-old make-up artist and nail technician installed motion-activated security cameras outside her property a few months ago, reports Wales Online. The cameras caught the man leaning over her gate and throwing the parcel at the door, before flicking the delivery slip on the ground and walking off. The man's face has been blurred for legal reasons. Jorja, from Port Talbot, Wales said: "I've got a security camera above the front door and it's motion-activated. "I got a notification on my phone at 8.08am that someone was at my door and I saw the video. "I was expecting to be home for the delivery, but I'd had to go out briefly... Fortunately, my neighbour saw the package on the floor and took it in for me, but he [the delivery driver] just threw it there and left it. He didn't even knock." Jorja's parcel was a food recipe box from HelloFresh and cost around Â£33. She said: "I've been having HelloFresh deliveries for two months, I've always enjoyed them, but you have to book them in advance. "I actually changed the delivery day as I was meant to be in [but had to pop out] - but he didn't even try the front door. "Luckily, HelloFresh are very good with their packaging, but if it was something else [it could have been damaged]."  A spokesperson for DPD said: "At DPD we take customer service and the behaviour of our people very seriously indeed. "Clearly, the behaviour here falls a long way short of what we expect from our drivers. "We are carrying out a full investigation and will take action, as appropriate. "We will also be making a full apology to the customer."
