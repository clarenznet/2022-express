The victim was driving along a residential road when two young men, and possibly a woman, were on e-scooters travelling towards her. The woman told the group it was illegal for them to use the scooters on the road itself but one of the yobs reached into her car and turned the engine off. He then threatened her, tried to open the car door and spat at her in Shurdington, Gloucestershire. When the victim called the police, the group fled. The woman in the car was physically unharmed but upset by the incident on May 17, Gloucestershire Live reports. Police are now appealing for information following the vile attack. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Constabulary said: "The man was described as being Asian, aged around 25, approximately 5ft 10ins in height and of a stocky build. He was wearing a bright red padded jacket with a hood, jeans and was riding a black E-scooter. "Several enquiries have taken place, including house to house and reviewing CCTV, however investigating officers are now keen to hear from anyone else who has not spoken to them." Last year, a top lawyer warned privately owned e-scooters "weren't going away" despite a number of serious accidents. Josh Hughes, who specialises in representing those with serious injuries suffered in road traffic accidents, spoke to Express.co.uk after several crashes, including one that left a "wonderful boy" dead in Bromley, southeast London. Mr Hughes said: "Where someone is injured by a privately owned e-scooter, say a pedestrian walking on a pavement or crossing a road, there is unlikely to be a valid insurance policy in place against which the injured party could recover compensation. "This could leave entirely innocent victims without justice which is clearly unsatisfactory. It is worth noting that, in this scenario, the rider at fault for the injuries would be left exposed to having to cover substantial damages and legal costs themselves."
