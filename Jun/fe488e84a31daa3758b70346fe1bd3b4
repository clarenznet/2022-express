The Royals actress donned a glittering lilac holographic dress complete with cut-out sections connected by chains for the ultimate show-stopping look. Her son Damian, 19, posed alongside her in one photo, rocking a black trouser suit with an embossed print. "Having a @versace moment," Liz declared on Instagram as she posted photos from the special day. Meanwhile her son proved he's inherited his mother's model looks as he showcased snaps from his own look "enroute" to the birthday celebrations.
