He joined TV star Jools Holland and soul singer Ruby Turner unannounced to gasps among the 250 guests. And alpaca farmer Bridget Tibbs swiftly marked his dance card - earning a tango with the future King to Softly As A Morning Sunrise.  Bridget revealed: "We were talking about dancing and then I said, 'Would you like to have a little dance?' I thought, 'You've got to ask!' He came back a few minutes later and said, 'Shall we have that dance?' "It was wonderful. He was very lovely to dance with, a lovely sense of rhythm, a nice hold." Charles earlier appeared at the dance thrown in the Orchard Room at his home in Highgrove, Glos. It was one of a number of events organised by his Prince's Foundation to help older people combat loneliness. The Prince of Wales, 73, also gave flowers and a birthday card to Elizabeth Powell, from Highnam, who is just 100. He and wife Camilla, 74, mark the Jubilee by appearing in EastEnders on BBC One tomorrow.
