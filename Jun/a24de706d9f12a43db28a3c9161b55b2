Countryfile's Helen Skelton had initially kept a low profile after her marriage to the father of her three children collapsed. However she has since been seen at a swanky Harrogate wine bar, Will and Vic's, with a host of other celebrity faces. She posed alongside TV doctor and This Morning regular Zoe Williams, Andy Murray's mother Judy and Anna Woolhouse. The starstruck staff at the venue reposted the photo of Helen's night out, gushing that they were "honoured to have @slingsbysocial golf academy ladies pop in for dinner". Alongside Zara Tindall, the sports-minded women are vying for the winner's title at the celebrity academy.
