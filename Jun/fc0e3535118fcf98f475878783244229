A worrying new report from the World Health Organisation claims the UK is on its way to becoming the fattest nation in Europe, with four in 10 of us soon to be obese. And food delivery apps, bringing us supersize portions of takeaway food, have been flagged as part of the problem.  But help is at hand from Kate and Kay Allinson, the culinary duo behind healthy cooking phenomenon Pinch of Nom. They are on a mission to get the nation cooking from scratch at home, and have created a range of recipes for what look like delicious takeaway favourites but with a fraction of the calories and the cost. Here are their recipes for you to try at home. Pinch of Nom Family Meal Planner by Kate Alllinson, Kay Allinson and Laura Davis (Bluebird, Â£10.99) is out now  Working out meals in advance won't just mean less food waste, it'll save you money too. Get organised and plan a week or two ahead - it makes it so much easier to stick to a budget while enjoying healthy food the whole family will love. GO BIG Every time you cook, make a bigger batch than you need for one meal. This means you'll always have something to eat when you're in a rush, saving you time and money. LOVE YOUR LEFTOVERS Eating leftovers isn't boring. Change it up so it never feels like you're eating the same thing on repeat. Serve dishes with different sides to keep it interesting. How about rice one night and chips the next? DIVIDE AND FREEZE Individual portions defrost quickly. Use airtight containers or freezer bags. Make sure they are properly sealed to avoid freezer burn, which will damage food. EAT ON DAY TWO Many recipes like curries and chillies taste even better after 24 hours in the fridge, because all those lovely ingredients have had time to marinate.
