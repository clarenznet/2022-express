Today (June 12), the Queen has officially reigned for the same length of time as the second longest-reigning monarch of a sovereign state, Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. Proclaimed King Bhumibol the Great in the 1980s, he reigned over the Southeast Asian country for 70 years and 126 days. But the Queen still has a little while to wait before she is crowned the longest-reigning monarch of all time. The longest-reigning monarch of all time was King Louis XIV of France, who reigned from 1643 until 1715. Louis reigned for a total of 72 years and 110 days - 26,407 days in total. Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand reigned for 25,694 days in total.

For much of his early life, Louis' mother Anne of Austria served as regent. The Queen became the third longest-reigning monarch of all time earlier this year when she surpassed Johann II of Liechtenstein, who reigned for 25,658 days (70 years and 91 days).  On September 9, 2015, Queen Elizabeth II became the nation's longest-reigning monarch ever ahead of her paternal great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria.

George III was the UK's third longest-reigning monarch and the longest-reigning king ever, sitting on the throne for 59 years and 96 days. DON'T MISS:Will Prince Louis get a royal title?
