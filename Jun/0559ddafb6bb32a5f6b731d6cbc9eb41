The French President also claimed that Paris would play a leading role in any future peace talks. He told local media: "We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means. I am convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power."   Macron had previously suggested that Ukraine must be prepared to cede territory to Moscow in order to facilitate a peace deal. However, the suggestion was roundly rejected by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky told the Italian news channel RAI 1 in May that Macron's effort to “suggest some things related to concessions of our sovereignty for the sake of saving face for Putin” was wrong. He added: “We are not ready to save something for someone and lose our territories over it.” Ukraine's Armed Forces claimed on Saturday that Russia had lost over 31,000 troops since the beginning of the invasion. The new figures were released as fierce fighting continues for control of Severodonestk in Luhansk province. SEE BELOW FOR UPDATES
