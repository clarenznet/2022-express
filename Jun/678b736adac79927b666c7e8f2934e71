The 2022 Formula One season heads into round eight this weekend with the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and the qualification process, but there are plenty of talking points within the world of F1 as the high octane sport returns to Baku. Lewis Hamilton heads into the event in disarray, looking to claw back something from what is turning into a nightmarish campaign. Both Hamilton and Mercedes have been warned they may need to "take some big decisions" to give their Formula One season some direction again. The Silver Arrows looked to have turned a corner in Spain but struggled in Monaco and had a tough Friday at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Hamilton was left sore from his W13 suffering heavy porpoising in Baku while George Russell spoke of issues with tyres and said after second practice: "Ferrari and Red Bull, they seemed to be able to turn it on. At the moment, they just have an inherently faster car than us and we've done everything we can to try and catch up." Elsewhere, there's trouble in paradise for Max Verstappen and his Red Bull team. It has emerged that the youngster had a chat with his father Jos after the former F1 driver fired shots at Red Bull following last month’s Monaco Grand Prix. Verstappen senior claimed in a column he wrote that the Austrian team’s strategy during the race favoured his son's team-mate Sergio Perez. Follow the latest F1 updates from Express Sport below...
