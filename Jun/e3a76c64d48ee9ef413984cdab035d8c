Manchester United have still got plenty of work to do in the transfer window as Erik ten Hag pushes for the club to a new midfielder following the departure of Paul Pogba. Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong is Ten Hag's prefered candidate but Christian Eriksen is also a bargain option. Liverpool have acted quickly to sign Darwin Nunez with Sadio Mane set to join Bayern Munich. However, Jurgen Klopp has been dealt another headache as he is reportedly set to lose Mohamed Salah in 12 months. Chelsea are holding talks with Inter Milan today where they will try to reach an agreement for Romelu Lukaku to return to the San Siro. That could then pave the way for Raheem Sterling to move from Manchester City. While Arsenal are looking to make more signings with Fabio Vieira's signing poised to be confirmed and Gabriel Jesus in the frame to follow him soon after.
