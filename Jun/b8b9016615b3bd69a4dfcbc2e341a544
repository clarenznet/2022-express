Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, 25, a former college student turned international superstar was seen posing in a new video for the brand Mugler. The brunette beauty sported a beige bondage-style leotard that looked very similar to her mother Madonna's style in the 1990s. Lourdes danced and posed atop a car in a nude suit that had sheer panels with straps and appeared to replicate a bondage theme that was popular 30 years ago. She also teamed the look with nude knee-high stockings with strappy heels to complete her daring look. In the clip, Lourdes moved around seductively, showing off her bottom, long legs, sculpted arms and numerous tattoos. Also, in the film, she dances on top of a vintage limousine in a photo studio thatâ€™s made to look like a New York City street at night. Mugler is the line from the late fashion designer Thierry Mugler who died in January.
