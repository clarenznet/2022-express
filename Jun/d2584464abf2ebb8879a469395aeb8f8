Aron Hicks, 28, overtook near the crest of a hill before smashing into a Honda Civic driven by Brian Hunt, who later died. Another vehicle's dashcam footage captured the painter and decorator ploughing into Mr Hunt, of Didcot, Oxfordshire.  Hicks, of Camberley, Surrey, told a probation officer he was showing off when the crash happened on the A417 near Cholsey, last May. He admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for three years and four months at Oxford Crown Court. In a letter, Hicks told Mr Hunt's family: "Knowing that my actions have caused this pain will be my life's biggest regret."  Mr Hunt's widow Susan called the tragedy "unimaginable and unpardonable". His son Stuart said it felt like "the heart of the family has been literally ripped out". Hicks was also banned from driving for three years and eight months.
