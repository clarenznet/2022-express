Liverpool have reportedly launched a mammoth £85.5million bid for Jude Bellingham, who Jurgen Klopp is a keen admirer of. However, Bellingham wouldn't join the Reds until 2023 due to the departure of Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. Newly-appointed Liverpool sporting director Julian Ward is set to complete the club's summer transfer business by wrapping up a deal for Calvin Ramsey. The right-back will sign for £5.5m, and will be the last arrival this summer after the blockbuster £64m deal for Darwin Nunez. But that doesn't mean Liverpool aren't already making plans for next year, with Bellingham said to be firmly in the club's sights. The Reds have reportedly launched a bid worth £85.5m for the England international. However, Dortmund's strict transfer policy means they will not sell two big-name players in one window, and they've already lost Haaland to Manchester City. As a result, Bellingham will stay at the Signal Iduna Park until next year, when he could depart the club. Bellingham is under contract until 2025, and it's believed Dortmund would ask for at least £100m in order to part ways with the wonderkid. Liverpool are expected to go all out to try and sign a new central midfielder next year, with Bellingham likely their top target. Real Madrid are also said to be interested in Bellingham, however. The European champions have already signed Aurien Tchouameni this summer, having brought in Eduardo Camavinga last year, and aren't short of options in the middle of the park. But Cadena Ser reports they're likely to challenge Liverpool for Bellingham's signature in 2023. Madrid missed out on Kylian Mbappe and have cash to burn, but club president Florentino Perez hinted on Thursday they could move for the Frenchman again in the future.
