  Dianne Buswell has admitted she finds it “really hard” to bid farewell to her Strictly Come Dancing co-stars in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. Earlier this year, she was forced to say goodbye to a few Strictly favourites, including Oti Mabuse and Aljaž Škorjanec.     Dianne, 33, has been busy this year, filming in sub-zero temperatures for ITV’s Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof and, most recently, teaming up with Sure to set a new Guinness world record for furthest distance danced by a couple with dance pro Pasquale La Rocca. However, with Strictly Come Dancing 2022 coming this autumn, Dianne shared her thoughts on what it was like saying goodbye to some of her longtime colleagues. Asked what it was like bidding farewell to Oti and Aljaž, she said: “It's really hard to say goodbye because we’ve become this really tight knit family. “But we always know that we're still going to see each other because we are so close.

I think he's hilarious and an amazing dancer," gushed Dianne. “He's such a perfect person for Strictly - everyone knows Anton from Strictly." Dianne went on to admit: “I must say, I missed him within all the pro numbers and stuff last year.     “But I absolutely loved seeing him just shine in that role of being a judge. “I thought he was just amazing. I always knew he would be good at that role and he was. “He was even better than I thought he would be,” Dianne added. The dancer also spoke about smashing a world record shortly ahead of her return to Strictly this Autumn, revealing: “It was really fun, actually. I thought it would be harder than it was. Two hours and 15 minutes of non-stop dancing - it’s something I can tick off my bucket list!” Dianne relied on Sure’s new 72H Nonstop Protection deodorant to keep her protected from sweat and odour as she pushed herself to her limits in the record-breaking dance session. Sure wants to encourage people to push themselves to their limits this summer without the fear of sweating.
