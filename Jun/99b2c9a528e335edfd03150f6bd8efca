The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee is almost upon us, and the event will be marked by a four-day bank holiday this weekend. Four days of celebrations will commence from Thursday, June 2 across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The celebration will see Brits given a bonus day off - with the late May Day bank holiday moved to the start of June. While millions will be celebrating, others will be using the extra time off work to get on with long-awaited home renovations or a spot of shopping. But as is usual with UK bank holidays, trading hours are subject to change. Thankfully, for those that will be doing just that, Swedish furniture behemoth IKEA will be open throughout the bank holiday for all your flat pack furniture needs.
