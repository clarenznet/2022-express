Patrick Stewart, 81, and his wife Sunny Ozell, 43, looked equally chic as they attended a gala benefit for Sean Penn's non-profit CORE in Los Angeles on Friday night. The Star Trek actor and his musician wife posed up a storm at the star-studded event. Patrick looked smart in a crisp shirt teamed with black trousers and a pin-striped blazer jacket. Sunny wowed in a red lace mid-length dress which she teamed with leopard print heels. The couple put on a sweet display as Patrick's other half wrapped her arm around the legendary actor. CORE, which stands for Community Organized Relief Effort, was launched by Sean, 61, in 2010 and aims to "bring immediate aid and recovery to underserved communities across the globe".
