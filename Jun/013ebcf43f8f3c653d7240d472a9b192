Victoria Beckham, 48, and Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, 47, shared a toast with tiny tea cups in a short clip published to Victoria's Instagram account. The fashion designer appeared to be having a rare moment of unadulterated relaxation as the pair sat together in their pyjamas, while husband David Beckham has been busy enjoying a holiday with their daughter Harper, 10. "Just two desperate housewives having a catch up!" joked Victoria, before affectionately adding: "I love you @evalongoria." The update went down a storm with her 30.1 million followers, racking up almost half a million views in just two hours. Some used the hashtag #friendshipneverends, in honour of the lyrics in the Spice Girls song Wannabe.
