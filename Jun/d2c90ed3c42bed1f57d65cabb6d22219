Margot Robbie, 31, and Ryan Gosling, 41, looked completely different today as they ran around the set of Barbie in their costumes. The Hollywood stars are set to portray the iconic dolls Barbie and Ken in the 2023 film. New set photos show the co-stars running around in some flashy cowboy outfits - with Margot wearing Barbie’s staple hot pink. In other pictures, the pair can be seen wearing fun and colourful retro workout sets as they rollerblade around Venice Beach.
