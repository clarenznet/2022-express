Ulrika Jonsson, 54, showed off her arm and hand tattoos today as she attended the first day of Royal Ascot in Berkshire. The presenter and model was all smiles in the sun as she posed alongside her son Cameron, who she shares with ex husband John Turnbull. Ulrika stunned at the glamorous event in a black midi dress with shoulder pads and ruched sleeves, and a matching fascinator over her sleek bun. She completed the look with a pair of nude heeled mules and a matching shoulder bag, as well as a set of dainty gold necklaces.
