The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took their daughter Lilibet - named after a nickname of the Queen's - to meet her great-grandmother for the first time on Thursday while they were visiting the UK for the Platinum Jubilee. Harry and Meghan reportedly wanted a private photographer present at the meeting. However, due to fears that the Sussexes would share the pictures with US television networks, the Queen is reported to have told them "no chance".
