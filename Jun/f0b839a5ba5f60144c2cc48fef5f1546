National Highways said this morning that lanes 1 and 2 heading southbound between Junctions 18 and 19 had been closed to allow for the urgent repair work to take place. The fire, which took place in the early hours of this morning, had previously left three lanes of four closed.  The motorways agency did not give a specific time they anticipated the road to reopen, but it anticipates normal traffic conditions to resume by 12.30pm. It warned of congestion 8 miles long between Junction 20a of the M56 and the M6, where the two intersect. Motorists are also being warned of "long delays" of 50 minutes above usual journey times through the stretch of road. National Highways said the repair work was necessary as the fire had "damaged the carriageway".   Cheshire fire services said in a statement that four engines from the surrounding area, including one from the Altrincham contingent of the Manchester fire service, had been dispatched to the fire. It said firefighters tackled the blaze in a "live lane", and believed that the fire had been caused by "overheated wheels". The service added: "The crews, in breathing apparatus, used two hose reel jets to put out the blaze and damp down the rest of the caravan which was completely damaged by fire." Junction 19 of the motorway is the turn-off Knutsford Services and the Tabley interchange, while Junction 18 is its intersection with the A54 outside Middlewich. The stretch of affected road sits between Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester. It is not the first time the M6 through Cheshire has been closed due to a caravan fire. Last August, National Highways had to move one off the motorway, while traffic was forced to crawl past the burning carcass.
