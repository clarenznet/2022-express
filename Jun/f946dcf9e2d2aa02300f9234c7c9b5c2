Rafael Nadal looked understandably rusty in the fisrt round of Wimbledon having not played any warm-up events, but still came through a difficult test in his win over Francisco Cerundolo in four sets. Just a week before Wimbledon it was not certain whether Nadal would play Wimbledon due to the foot injury which he aggravated at Roland Garros.  But the Spaniard was keen to keep his hopes of a Calendar Slam alive and was placed in the bottom half of the draw where he faces a favourable run to the second week. First up was to avoid any kind of upset against Cerundolo, who has enjoyed a breakout year in 2022 so far. There was nothing between the two in the opening few sets, but Nadal was able to step it up when it mattered most to get breaks in the first two sets. But Cerundolo continued to threaten to take the match to Nadal and that came in the third with some brilliant play from the 23-year-old. It then looked like we were going to five sets, but Nadal stepped it up a gear to see off his opponent and progress to the next match.
