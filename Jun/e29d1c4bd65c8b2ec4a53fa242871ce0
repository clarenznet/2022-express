She's long been known for her stylish looks while appearing on the radio airwaves.And Ashley Roberts put on yet another stylish display in a 1980s-inspired dress as she headed home from work at Heart FM on Monday. The Pussycat Dolls star, 40, looked effortlessly chic as the ensemble flaunted her incredible figure - with the bottom half featuring a red skirt design, while the top was baby pink. The stylish outfit by British fashion designer Hasan Hejazi featured Bishop sleeves as well as oversized shoulder pads. Shielding her eyes behind square sunglasses, the star wore her blonde tresses back from her beautiful face. Carrying the colour story into her accessories, Ashley opted for red pumps and a matching woven bag. It comes after Ashley and her Heart FM colleague Amanda Holden once again showed off their playful side as they celebrated day one of the Wimbledon Championships. The duo posted snaps to Instagram from the studio - clad in tennis gear as they celebrated "Wimblebum".
