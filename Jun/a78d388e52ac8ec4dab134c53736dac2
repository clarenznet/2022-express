Sharon Stone, 64, was joined by Sean Penn in walking the red carpet during a gala for his non-profit, CORE in Los Angeles on Friday. The starred commanded the crowd’s attention as she wore a pink satin suit layered over a white shirt, matched with a pair of white trainers. Her short blonde hair was combed over to the right side as she wore long, dangling earrings. Meanwhile the Mystic River actor, 61, rocked a dark blue suit with a black tie. CORE, which stands for Community Organized Relief Effort, was launched by Sean in 2010 and its goal is to “bring immediate aid and recovery to underserved communities across the globe.” Sean and Sharon were joined by many other stars at the event including X-Men actor Patrick Stewart and his wife Sunny Ozell.
