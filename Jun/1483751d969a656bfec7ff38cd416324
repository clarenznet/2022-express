International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan yesterday confirmed the Government was willing to breach World Trade Organisation rules for the "national interest". Meanwhile, Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit in Germany insisted that steel was a "different thing" compared with food where ministers are seeking to reduce tariffs. After Brexit the UK rolled over EU protection on 10 steel categories until mid-2024. British safeguards on five other types will be extended until this time. Ms Trevelyan told MPs "there would be serious injury or the threat of serious injury to UK steel producers" if the safeguards were removed. She called it a "strategic UK industry" facing energy and supply chain problems. Labour backed the move but some Tory MPs criticised the measures as a lurch towards "protectionism."
