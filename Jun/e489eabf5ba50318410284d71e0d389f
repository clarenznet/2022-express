Queen and Adam Lambert are well into their UK tour after opening the Platinum Jubilee concert so spectacularly at the start of the month. During their epic set of non-stop rock, which is over 2 hours long, Brian May performs a number of incredible guitar solos. One of them sees him standing on an asteroid surrounded by planets in one of the show's many moments of amazing special effects. Yet despite over 50 years of performing with Queen on the electric guitar, Brian still struggles with moments of self-doubt. Sharing a clip of the segment in the show, the 74-year-old wrote: “Here’s a fragment from my Dvořák solo adventure in the show a few nights ago. This is the kind of thing I always wanted to do - so it fulfils a dream for me. But on this particular night I felt very critical of my playing - very lacking in confidence.” However, he admitted he changed his mind after seeing the footage for himself. Brian added: “So I wouldn’t have looked for a video clip of it. But I just found this vid captured from out front by @mariasavemefriend3d - found it because my dear pal @paul.crook.music discovered it and gave me a great compliment about it. So now I feel reassured. Now, even if I feel my notes are less than perfect, perched up there on my Asteroid, I will be safe in the knowledge that the moment works out there, where it matters most. THANKS !! I needed that.
