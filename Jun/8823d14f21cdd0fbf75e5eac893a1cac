Mike Bushell was on hand to present the latest sports news on Saturday’s BBC Breakfast and surprisingly, talk turned to Love Island. As the sports presenter explained a rugby star could be heading into the villa, he asked Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty if they’d give up their career for a spot on a reality show such as Love Island. Mike asked: “What lengths would you go to if you had the chance to enter the Love Island villa?” “Well no, I wouldn’t,” Naga replied as Charlie remained silent. Mike continued: “You wouldn’t give up your job would you?” “No, I’m not planning on it Mike,” Charlie hit back.
