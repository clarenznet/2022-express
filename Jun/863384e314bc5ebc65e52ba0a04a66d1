Members of the Communication Workers Union at Crown Post Offices - the larger branches often seen on high streets - will walk out for the day. Workers in administration and supply chain networks are set to strike on Monday. The union said Post Office management had insisted on a pay freeze for 2021-22 and a "marginally improved" pay offer for 2022. CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey said: "Our members do not want to be in this situation, but they won't accept humiliation either." "Our members worked hard to deliver an excellent annual profit for the company. Affordability isn't management's problem here. Frankly, their degrading excuse for an offer has only hardened members, who won't tolerate a collapse in their living standards. "We thank the public for their support, and we urge the Post Office to get around the table and thrash out a real settlement that treats key worker heroes with the respect they deserve." Around 3,500 union members are involved in the dispute. A Post Office spokesman apologised for any inconvenience but said: "We want to assure our customers that the vast majority of our branches are unaffected by CWU strike action. There are 114 branches, typically in city centres, that are directly managed by Post Office." "Over two-thirds would normally only be open between 9am and 12.30pm on a Saturday."
