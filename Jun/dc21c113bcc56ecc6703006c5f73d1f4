Princess Beatrice, 33, is looking very cool at Glastonbury today with her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The parents of little Sienna are taking a break from parenting to enjoy the musical acts at the famous pyramid stage.  It was a fresh new look for the Princess. The shirt dress even had a massive gold buckle belt in the centre. The 33-year-old could be seen carrying an over-the-shoulder black bag for the occasion.  From the photos, it is unclear currently which brand the bag is from. Beatrice accessorised with big black sunglasses to mask the bright sunshine at the festival. For footwear, the Princess opted for a pair of plain white plimsoll trainers.  These perfectly matched her husband, Edoardo. Edoardo opted for a denim on-denim look for the occasion. The brown denim jacket worked quite well with his black navy jeans. The royal then opted for a plain white T-shirt underneath.  Both Beatrice and Edoardo wore matching white trainers with a T on their right shoe. Therefore, both shoes appear to be from the same brand. Both royals could be seen wearing wristbands for the festival. Edoardo was also seen carrying a pair of suave looking sunglasses for the day.
