Amanda Holden, 51, sparked a frenzy amongst her 1.8 million Instagram followers once again today as she flashed her peachy derriere alongside Ashley Roberts, 40.  The duo, who work together on Heart FM, posed up a storm in pictures inspired by the racy Tennis Girl poster, taken by Martin Elliott, featuring his then-girlfriend Fiona Walker iconically showing off her bum on a tennis court in September 1976.  Both Amanda and Ashley wore matching skimpy white tennis outfits while holding rackets aloft and pouting for the camera.  The stars lifted up the corner of their skirts to unveil a glimpse of their underwear, in a bid to mirror the Tennis Girl’s pose, while Amanda cheekily captioned her Boomerang video: “Itchy bum #Wimbledon day 1”.  Amanda and Ashley could be seen enjoying the picturesque London skyline in the sun as they looked forward to Wimbledon 2022, before the Britain's Got Talent judge met up with her daughter Lexi to enjoy the first day of the tennis tournament.  Many fans rushed to compliment the girls on their tennis outfits, as bumbling_fool_99 penned: “Tennis is looking good today, 2 beautiful ladys.”(sic)  martin.d345 mischievously commented: “Need a hand???”
