Jennifer Lopez, 52, has taken her jaw-dropping style to the 2022 MTV Movie and TV Awards red carpet. The singer donned a revealing outfit as she stunned fans.  The actress was dressed impeccably in a leather top which featured a deep neckline, showing off a daring amount of skin. Jennifer matched the dress with a black skirt featuring a slit. It was topped off with a pair of stiletto heels, with her brown locks worn long. The skirt also featured cut-outs to show off her enviable figure.  During the ceremony, the On The Floor hitmaker took to the stage to accept the accolade for her song On My Way from her film Marry Me. The actress was surprised and touched by the honour. "Guys, thank you so much for this," she said. "I didn't expect this, I was here for later," she quipped. "On My Way is a song that means a lot to me, it's a really personal song. It's about faith and belief in every step of your journey.”
