The Prince has been absent from public view during the main Jubilee Celebrations. Although he is no longer classed as a full-time working royal, an announcement was also made that the Queen's second son had tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, a song based on the classic nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York but directly naming him has entered the UK singles charts. The band previously took aim at Boris Johnson and LadBaby. The track is by UK punk outfit The K***s, who have had two previous top five hits. Their latest is titled Prince Andrew Is a Sweaty N***e. On the latest BBC Radio1 chart countdown, Jack Saunders, who was sitting in for Scott Mills, announced a new entry for the song, "by an artist that is too rude to say on the radio with a track that is also too rude to say on the radio." The band tweeted: "The UK's best-selling single of the week. No radio, no TV, no print press, no BBC. Free speech? My ar**." The song has been placed by the Official Chart Company at number 20, with Harry Styles claiming the top spot with As It Was, followed by Cat Burns' Go and Lizzo's About Damn Time. However, the band themselves have been claiming a different story on their social media, under the Twitter handle K**t and the Gang. They wrote: "Number 20 in official charts - shenanigans? Best-selling single of the week, though. Prince Andrew is a Sweaty N***e takes its place in the history books." The band is a satirical comedy act, fronted by a performer currently known as K**t, who is from Basildon in Essex but will not reveal his real name. He spoke out this week, telling NME: " For me, having grown up with the folklore around The Sex Pistols’ God Save The Queen getting robbed of the top spot in ’77, a Jubilee celebration has always felt like it could be a good chance to air any grievances one may have with our unelected head of state and her feckless offspring." The band previously made two attempts to knock LadBaby off the top of the Christmas charts, saying at the time: "We would not stoop to using poverty, hunger and despair to promote our career like we believe LadBaby have done in this year’s Christmas number one campaign." Both previous times their target was another divisive establishment figure, Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The 2020 and 2021 singles  Boris Johnson is a F*****g C**t and Boris Johnson is Still a F*****g C**t both reached number five in the UK singles chart.
