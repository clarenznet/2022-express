 Another huge summer of sport is underway, with Wimbledon, the British Grand Prix and the British Open all around the corner and the football transfer window kicking into life after an end-of-season international break. You can, of course, follow all the summer sporting action with our brilliant Express tennis, F1, golf and transfer newsletters, but we want to give you something extra special in order to be able to watch the action yourself. That’s why we’re offering you the chance to win a brand new 55" OLED LG TV! This state of the art smart TV is the perfect bit of kit to watch all the action play out over the summer and there will surely be lots on to keep you entertained. The TV comes with Dolby Vision IQ and Dolby Atmos, creating the sort of sport-watching experience that’s only secondary to actually being in the stadium.
