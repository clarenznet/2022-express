The cancellation was last minute and was due to bad weather over London. The news was confirmed before 4pm and was to be a follow up to the aerial display that wowed crowds on Thursday when Jubilee celebrations kicked off. On Thursday, the Queen herself watched the action from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.  The air show was due to take place over Buckingham Palace at 5:05pm to mark the closing of the Jubilee celebrations. The Red Arrows also had to cancel an airshow in Torbay, as part of the English Riviera Airshow. The Red Arrows Twitter page stated: "Unfortunately, our display at the Riviera Airshow won’t be going ahead today due to the weather conditions in Torbay. "There is extremely low cloud and very poor visibility, outside of the safety limits for display flying." Referring to the cancellation, Red Arrows Squadron Leader Graeme Muscat tweeted: "As it says below, unfortunately, the weather has not been kind today. "The whole Team is gutted but safety must come first. "I wasn’t even able to get in on the support helicopter." On Friday the Queen was captured saying "how incredible" during the Red Arrows flypast over central London.   The Queen appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the six-minute display of more than 70 aircraft. The airshow also featured Apache helicopters, Typhoons and The Red Arrows. The flyover also sowed dozens of aircraft from the Royal Navy, the Army and Royal Air Force soared over the royal residence after Trooping the Colour.
