This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield, 60, grimaced and groped at his face as he grappled with a new face mask beauty treatment. "Ahh, I'm RUBBISH at this - it's stuck in my eye!" he exclaimed in view of his three million Instagram followers, as he reclined on his bed and desperately tried to reposition the transparent mask. "I'm definitely gonna need practise here!" (sic) he admitted, before exclaiming it looked like a scene from a "horror movie". His hydrogel face mask had promised to hydrate, firm and even his skin tone, while giving him a "youthful glow" - but by the end of his attempts to position it correctly, Phillip was in fits of hysterical laughter. His verdict? "I'm so s*** at this!"
