UPDATE: The issues with YouTube comments not showing appears to have been resolved, with Down Detector reports of YouTube down dropping sharply. This indicates whatever was plaguing users has now been fixed, with the problem being resolved over an hour and a half after it was first reported. Express.co.uk has seen the comments section on both the YouTube website and iPhone app showing once again after it disappeared earlier this evening. ORIGINAL: YouTube comments have suddenly stopped appearing on the hugely popular video sharing platform. Independent outage monitor Down Detector has today recorded a huge spike in YouTube down reports which began around 6pm BST. At the time of writing downdetector.com has registered a peak of around 2,000 reports of YouTube down. While on Twitter users have been reporting that comments have suddenly stopped appearing for them. One tweeted: "Great youtube is being weird not loading comments". While another posted: "Where are the youtube comments??? @YouTube". One added: "@youtube comments arenâ€™t loading". And another wrote: "Is it just me or I can't see any YouTube comments except like one just recently??" Express.co.uk has contacted Google about the reported issues YouTube users are experiencing tonight and have asked if a fix is in the works. From our experience, we're seeing the YouTube comments section isn't showing on the YouTube website as well as on the YouTube iPhone app. While on the Android app we're seeing the top comment appearing in YouTube videos but not any other comments. It also appears that the Live Chat feature is still functioning across both the YouTube website as well as the official Google made apps. The official Team YouTube support Twitter account has confirmed that there is a problem with the comments section and a fix is being worked on. In a reply to one user the Team YouTube Twitter account posted: "We're aware of this. We're currently working on a fix." According to the Down Detector outage map though, the issues affecting the comments section of YouTube has hit multiple countries. Problems have been reported in the UK, US and in Europe.
