Ryan Gosling, 41, has been pictured for the first time as the beloved Ken Doll for the upcoming Barbie movie. The film will be released next year, with fellow Hollywood star Margot Robbie taking on the role of Barbie. The actor looked unrecognisable with his orange tan, bleached white hair and denim attire. Ryan's chiseled abs are on show, along with his boxers reading "Ken". Warner Bros. Pictures posted the picture in view of their 5 million Twitter followers. They captioned the post: "#BARBIE July 21, 2023 Only in theaters." Many social media users took to the comments to share their view on Ryan's transformation, with there being a divide in opinion. DCruz25 said: "Why did they make him blonde! He looks so much better with his natural colour!" DarkMalicex added: "So many questions right now but mainly why is this a thing?" Rainy1 commented: "I'm ready for this Ken doll!" It appears as if the actor is dressed as the Earring Magic Ken model, introduced by Mattel in 1993. Upon release, it became the highest-selling Ken doll in history and caused a stir when some people speculated that designers had taken inspiration from the gay clubbing scene in early nineties New York and Los Angeles.
