Monty Don, 66, has been inundated with praise after he revealed he had helped a baby bird who got stuck in his greenhouse. The Gardeners’ World star took to Instagram yesterday to share the anecdote with his one million followers. Annepeddlesden commented: “Thank goodness- they get so frightened!” Cotswoldsbabs wrote: “Well done! Poor Woody. “It must be so stressful for them when trapped.” Angiedelve added: “Well done for getting it out. “I once had a green one in mine, I thought that I was going to lose a few panes, but luckily it found its own way out.” Jennywebb214 typed: “Well done such a beautiful bird.” Monty had concerned fans last month as he announced he was bedridden due to illness. The horticulturalist explained he had spent days in bed fighting Covid in a health update following concerns over his absence from the BBC.

Monty admitted that his battle with the disease had not been “fun”. However, he reassured his social media followers that he was feeling “better”. Marlene83206325 said: “Get well soon Monty, covid is a real bummer, but don't try to push yourself once negative. It takes more than you realise.” NewpPaul wrote: “It really knocks you down. Don't rush back to work, the recovery is quite slow in some cases. All the best.” Lorrielaughs typed: “Take it easy Monty it can come back just when you think you are past the worst.” Monty had been notably missing from his popular BBC2 show, Gardener's World, in the weeks leading up to his health update. Whilst he was away, he handed over his presenting duties to Adam Frost and Arit Anderson.
