Amanda Holden, 51, looked chic in a patterned mini dress as she made a very stylish departure when she exited Global Studios. The Heart FM DJ rocked an eye-catching number as she paraded her endless legs which were teamed with lilac heels. The age-defying beauty opted to go braless as the cut-out dress gave a glimpse of her cleavage. Her Heart FM co-star Ashley Roberts looked chic in a beige cut-out mini dress as she strutted down the street following her shift. The radio DJ later took to Instagram and was inundated with messages as she shared a clip of the co-stars which she captioned: "Take your child to work day."
