Traffic is being held after a crash involving two vehicles on the M25 clockwise between Junction 3 M20 (Swanley interchange) and Junction 2 A2 (Darenth interchange). Congestion on the motorway continues as far back as the Dartford Tunnel. Traffic has been stopped for the crash in lane four of the four lanes. Traffic England said there are currently delays of 15 minutes against expected traffic. They added “normal traffic conditions are expected between 15:00 and 15:15”. It comes after a three car collision also caused significant delays for traffic on the M25 on the entry slip road to the anticlockwise carriageway at junction 13 near Staines. One lane was closed on the slip road for around two hours while emergency services cleared the incident. There have been no reports as of writing about any casualties. At 1.31pm, the incident at junction 13 was cleared and traffic flowed freely again in the area. Also on Sunday, the M25 was closed after an accident at the Dartford Crossing on the anticlockwise carriageway. Two lanes were closed as well as the right-hand tunnel under the river while the incident was dealt with. At 9.07am, the M25 reopened with the Dartford Crossing closed for just over two hours due to the collision.
