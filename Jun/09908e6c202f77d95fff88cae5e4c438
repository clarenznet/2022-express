Russell Kane, 46, has called for the Queen’s extended family to get jobs in “marketing offices” in a discussion about the Royal Family. The comedian told Express.co.uk the monarchy was an integral part of “British culture”. Giving his opinion on the Queen ahead of her Platinum Jubilee this week, Russell said: “She has got what I call true leadership qualities in that she doesn't have to shout or make a fuss to lead. “Loads of people can become leaders by force of their personality, but it's much harder to become a leader through what you don't say. Much harder. “I just love British culture and all things about us,” he continued. “It wouldn't feel like Britain to not have [the Royal Family]. “We are proud of it. You can get yourself tied up in knots about inherited privilege, but there's a certain core crew that I do think should be there on the throne, I think they're amazing. “I do agree when it's all the extended family, like the Duke's second cousin who lives in Wales somewhere, they probably need to get a job in a marketing office or something,” he quipped. Russell also gave his verdict on the Queen’s recent health concerns which have seen her pull out of several public engagements. “I don't know if you remember the Queen Mother,” said Russell. “She wasn't seen in public towards the end, because she didn't like to be seen. “She wouldn't use a wheelchair and didn't want to be seen using a zimmer frame because she thought it was un-leaderlike and not regal. “I suspect Her Majesty has got a similar sort of... It's not vanity, it's a PR type thing. “You need to be seen as a strong leader, she's always so powerful, she probably doesn't want to be seen having mobility issues, in fact she has stated that.
