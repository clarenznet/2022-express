Analysis by the Local Government Association (LGA) found three million households in fuel poverty in England. The average extra cost is caused by heat wasted through walls, roofs and windows of poorly insulated housing. The LGA, which represents 350 councils in England and Wales, is calling for a redoubling of Government efforts to insulate all fuel poor homes, which it says would cut millions from energy bills.  David Renard, LGA environment spokesman, said: “So many homes are leaking more and more money as energy prices increase. This will hit stretched household budgets hard and the public purse, while adding to the climate crisis.” His demand joins a growing chorus of calls for more action, with the independent advisory Climate Change Committee describing efforts as “shocking”.
