Madonna, 63, has taken to Instagram to share a quirky 10-second video of herself, leaving many fans asking the same thing. At the beginning of the video, Madonna can be seen walking with her hands in her boots before the shot changes and unveils the Vogue hitmaker's racy outfit. At first, Madonna can be seen in tie-dye shorts and a black top as she stomps down a hallway with her hands in her shoes, while staring at the camera. The shot then changes to a catwalk style video of the Holiday singer in a black busty bodice covered in chains. She strutted down a hotel hallway as she showed off her attire in view of her 18.3 million Instagram followers. Many social media users took to the post to comment on Madonna's latest polarising antics. Ughhhholyfvck said: "What are you doin? Are you okay?" (sic) Fabjo50 added: "Gurl, what's going on?" (sic)
