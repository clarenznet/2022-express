Dick Van Dyke, 96, looked sprightly in brand new photos of the Mary Poppins star at the weekend. The nonagenarian admitted he was “just glad to be here” when asked by passers by what he had planned for Father’s Day. He was spotted emerging from a restaurant, having just shared lunch with a friend in LA. Dick, who has been married to 50-year-old Arlene Silver since 2012, then got into his car and drove off to run some errands. He looked casual and relaxed in a long-sleeved grey fleece and navy slacks.
