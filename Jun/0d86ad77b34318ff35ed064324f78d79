Adil Khan, 51, and Qari Abdul Rauf, 52, have been told they are to be sent back to Pakistan for the public good. Both were part of the group and convicted of serious sex offences in May 2012. Since their release from jail, they have fought a long legal battle arguing deportation would interfere with their human rights. Khan appeared at a final hearing yesterday to argue he should stay. Judge Charlotte Welsh asked him how his son might be affected if he was removed. Khan replied: "The father figure is very important in every culture in the world - to be a role model for the child, to tell him or her right from wrong."  He claimed he is not wanted by family in Pakistan because his notoriety would be bad for their business. Khan got a 13-year-old pregnant, then met another girl, 15, and trafficked her to others using violence when she complained. The appeal hearing against the men was adjourned until this morning.
