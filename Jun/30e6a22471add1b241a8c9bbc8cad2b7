We are now just a matter of days out from the summer transfer window but that hasn’t stopped the activity amongst Premier League clubs ahead of a manic few months. Manchester United have been linked with upwards of five players, with Darwin Nunez, Frenkie de Jong and Jurrien Timber at the top of their shortlist. Erik ten Hag is planning a big rebuilding job this summer and wants to change the face of the team to suit his style for next season. Tottenham are another club linked with several players with Antonio Conte chasing six signings. Spurs have already signed Ivan Perisic and have agreed a deal for Fraser Forster to challenge Hugo Lloris and are said to be pushing for a third signing in the coming days. Arsenal and Chelsea are also set for busy summers while Liverpool could be forced into signing a forward replacement for Sadio Mane, who seems to be angling for a move to Bayern Munich. There will also be plenty of eyes on what Newcastle do as they enter their first summer window after being taken over by a Saudi Arabian consortium. Eddie Howe initially played down a summer splurge but recent reports claim they've agreed a £40million deal for Hugo Ekitike with more signings expected to follow. But who will they sign? And will United get their hands on their prime targets?
