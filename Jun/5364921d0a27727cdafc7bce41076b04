Louisa James was informing Good Morning Britain viewers about how inflation reached another record high in May of just over nine percent. As she was reporting outside Westminster an anti-Brexit protester, named Steve Bray, was holding two placards with the words "Brexit is not working" and "cost of Tory crisis". ITV viewers lambasted the protester and called for security to keep him away from Louisa. @Domain_Harry fumed on Twitter: "Louisa James is so gonna [hit] that protester one day. #gmb."Kev added: "Why don’t they have some security to keep that f****g idiot Bray away from the reporter? #GMB"A confused Sue remarked: "Is it a one-man protest?"

(sic) Steve shared pictures of himself with his signs behind Louisa on his own Twitter account and captioned them, "Good Morning Britain".  Dozens of his followers commented on his post, with Caroline Mackenzie saying: "Excellent loitering with placards today, I've just seen GMB." While Louisa was telling viewers about the Prime Minister warning how public sector pay increases would plunge the country into an inflationary spiral, Steve stared waving his placards. When he turned the signs around the words "Get Johnson out of our democracy" and "We despite Tory lies" were shown to the camera. Louisa continued with her report while Steve was holding up the signs so viewers could read them.

"Some other prices have been rising less steeply than they did this time last year - things like clothing. "So that has offset that but 9.1 percent is already a huge struggle for a lot of people." She added as she carried on blanking the protester: "That is not going to get any better anytime soon."  Steve, who is an activist from South Wales, often shares pictures from his anti-Brexit protests on his Twitter account. He has disrupted several news reports in the past and in 2019 he made daily protests against Brexit in Westminister. The activist has coined the names Stop Brexit Man, Mr Stop Brexit and Stop Brexit guy. Good Morning Britain continues on weekdays at 6am on ITV.
