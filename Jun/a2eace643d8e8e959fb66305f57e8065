Denise Van Outen, 48, looked ageless as she posed for pictures at the The Hurlingham Club in London. The Gogglebox star looked amazing in a strappy shimmering gold dress, featuring a sheer skirt element. The tight-fitted corset style top to the dress highlighted Denise's slim figure as she also showed off her toned arms. Denise also showed off her ample assets with the busty number. Her signature platinum white hair was styled in a loose curl, as she went for neutral make-up. This comes as reports Denise has moved on from Eddie Boxshall with a property developer, eight months after the former couple split. The MailOnline reported that the star has been happily dating Jimmy Barba for a few weeks after being introduced by a male friend. She attended this evening's event with her rumoured love interest. Express.co.uk have contacted Denise' representatives for comment.
