Today's Epsom Derby is one of the biggest days in the racing calendar and has this year coincided with the Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend celebrations. The Queen is a lover of horses and was due to have one horse racing in this afternoon's event - despite not being able to attend herself. The Queen's horse Just Fine was due participate in today's penultimate race - the World Pool Northern Dancer Handicap - however, it has been pulled from competing. With four days packed full of activities to commemorate her 70 years on the throne, unfortunately, the Queen will not be in attendance at today's Epsom Derby. The 96-year-old has been experiencing episodic mobility problems and has pulled out of attending the races and Friday's thanksgiving service after "discomfort" during Trooping the Colour on Thursday. Instead, Princess Anne will represent the Queen at Epsom Downs today.
