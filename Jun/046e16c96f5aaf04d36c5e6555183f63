The Prime Minister's solution to the impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol has proven unpopular, with a majority of legislators in the country's assembly opposed to unilateral attempts to overturn its contents. Britons also appear tired of what has been perceived as Mr Johnson's decision to pick a fight with the EU and have accused him of using the conflict to cover the fallout from Partygate and a devastating Tory confidence vote. But they remain invested in Brexit as a movement, and other parties have suggested they would handle the situation differently.  Labour recently confirmed it would not attempt to undo the landmark 2016 vote, as shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the party would prefer to "fix" Conservative mistakes. Earlier this year, shadow trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds suggested Labour would pursue trade deals with a worker-centred focus. Tory members have offered advice as well, as Tobias Elwood controversially advocated for the country to return to the Single Market.
