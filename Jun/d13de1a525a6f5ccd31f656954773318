It is alleged Nigerian politician Ike Ekweremadu, 60, and his wife Beatrice Ekweremadu, 55, both Nigerian nationals, conspired to arrange the travel of a youngster to the UK in order to harvest organs. A child has been safeguarded and the Metropolitan Police is working with its partners to offer continued support. The suspects have been remanded in custody and will appear at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court later today. An investigation was launched after detectives discovered potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May, reports Daily Mirror.
