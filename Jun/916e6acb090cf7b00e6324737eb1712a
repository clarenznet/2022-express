Premier League clubs continue to work at furious pace to improve their squads ahead of the new season as pre-season rapidly approaches. Some teams are already back in training ahead of the new campaign and will welcome some new faces to their camps. Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal are among those looking to clinch some high-profile additions this week. Arsenal are poised to announce the £45million arrival of Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. But the Gunners look like they may miss out on Leeds United winger Raphinha, also courted by Chelsea and Tottenham. Chelsea look to have stolen a march on their rivals and hope to bring the Brazilian in for an initial £55m. They also want to take Raheem Sterling from City as the Blues strengthen out wide. Manchester United are meanwhile closing in on their first signings with Tyrell Malacia said to be preferring a move to Old Trafford rather than Lyon. While the Red Devils hope to finally close a deal to bring in Frenkie de Jong this week. And Tottenham are eager to bring in Everton's Richarlison having attempted a deal that also would've taken his team-mate Anthony Gordon to London.
