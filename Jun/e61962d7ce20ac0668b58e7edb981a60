Kim Kardashian, 41, has showcased her famous figure in a new promotional campaign for her clothing range SKIMS. Donning her new sleepwear line, the mum-of-four looked sensational as she flashed the underside of her assets. Blonde again since she wore Marilyn Monroe’s gown at the Met Gala, Kim wore luxuriously long eyelashes with a nude lip and ran her hands through her tousled locks. “Just dropped new @SKIMS Sleep Set. Shop now in 4 colors and sizes XXS to 4X at SKIMS.COM,” she wrote in view of her 321 million followers. Kim, who recently split from rapper Kanye West, sparked controversy amid claims she had damaged Marilyn’s dress that the actress wore in 1962 while singing Happy Birthday to US President John F. Kennedy. But Kim has since denied these allegations, and the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum, which loaned the dress to Kim, has also insisted no damage was done to the gown. They claimed the split seams seen in circulating photos were caused by an incident in 2017.
