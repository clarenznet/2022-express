Russian officials did their “utmost” to avoid the topic of the war in Ukraine at the annual Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, according to reports. The Kremlin leader argued the invasion was justified because he was protecting Russian speakers in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk peoples’ republics of eastern Ukraine, which Russia recognised as independent ahead of the “special military operation”. Questioned on this line, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was sitting beside Putin, signalled that he disagreed. He said Kazakhstan does not recognise “quasi-state territories which, in our view, is what Luhansk and Donetsk are”, and added there would be “chaos” in the world if hundreds of new countries emerged.
