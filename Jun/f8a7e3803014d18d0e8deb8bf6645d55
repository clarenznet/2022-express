Prince Harry and Meghan Markle moved to the US after they became non-working royals in 2020, and their visits to the UK since then have been few and far between. But the couple finally made their long-awaited public return to this side of the Pond last week to support the Queen at the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, and the couple arrived to cheers, and some boos, at the Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral. There are fewer working royals now following Prince Andrew, Harry and Meghan's departures in recent years and royal author Tina Brown said there is a chance the Firm will want Harry back in the fold in the future.  The author of 'The Palace Papers' told the Guardian's podcast Today in Focus: "I think there is excessive pressure on the Cambridges at the moment to be essentially taking up the slack for both Harry and Andrew.
