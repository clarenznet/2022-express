Amanda Holden, 51, teased fans as she shared a short video to her Instagram yesterday in view of her 1.8 million followers. The candid clip showed Amanda in her pyjamas as she got herself ready in the morning. The Britain's Got Talent judge stunned in navy floral PJs as she completed her usual routine, including a morning dumbbell workout. The video ended showing her promoting the Revive collagen product that keeps her looking so youthful. Amanda previously revealed she suffers from keloid skin, a condition that means when you heal from a skin injury, you're left with a thick raised scar often bigger than the original wound. Speaking to You Magazine last year, Amanda revealed why she wouldn't be going under the knife. She said: "I have keloid skin, which makes [surgery] not such a great proposition," she said. Amanda does, however, undergo small treatments such as Morpheus8, a combined radiofrequency and microneedling procedure that stimulates collagen production. Amanda first underwent the Morpheus8 treatment ahead of the Britain's Got Talent live shows in 2020, writing on Instagram: "The results have been absolutely amazing. I’ve noticed a real plumpness to my skin and it’s much tighter. "I’m more than happy to shout from the rooftops about how brilliant this new treatment is! It’s been the best hour investment for looking at least five years younger."
