The Duke of Cambridge joined Princess Anne and his father Prince Charles, who took the salute and inspected the troops on behalf of the Queen as the four-day weekend Platinum Jubilee celebrations got underway. Prince William joined his father Charles, who normally takes part in the Trooping ceremony on horseback in his role as Colonel, Welsh Guards, who took the salute and inspected the troops of the Household Division on the Queen's behalf, joined by the Princess Royal, Colonel The Blues and Royals, who are also mounted.  The Prince of Wales went ahead of the Duke of Cambridge and the Princess Royal as they rode diagonally across the forecourt and under the arches of Horse Guards. Charles wore his scarlet Colonel of the Welsh Guards uniform and green thistle sash riding a horse named George. While, the Duke of Cambridge rode on Derby in his Irish Guards uniform and Anne on a horse named Sir John in her Colonel of the Blues and Royals uniform as part of the Trooping the Colour parade.  Prince William is later expected to join his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, and reunite with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who arrived in the UK on Wednesday. After the ceremony, the Queen will acknowledge the salute of the returning Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment from Buckingham Palace's balcony before she later joins working royals on the balcony to watch the traditional fly-past of aircraft. The Duke of Cambridge appeared satisfied with his handiwork; earlier this week, he led 1,500 soldiers and 350 horses through a 90-minute rehearsal of the military parade in his full Irish Guards regalia. Prince William, who is second in line to the throne after the Prince of Wales, has served as colonel of the regiment since 2011. In an update last week, the infantry regiment said that as well as guarding the royal residences, its men were “still first and foremost fighting soldiers” and “must be operationally ready at all times”.
