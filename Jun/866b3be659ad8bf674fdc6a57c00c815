The comedy actor, 67, has played the childish buffoon since 1990, with the original sitcom spawning films, books and an animated series.  Rowan said: "Bean is such a weird man and - I like to think at least - far removed from my own personality. The distance I have to move in order to play him is actually very reassuring. "It's like entering a completely different world and I'm very happy in his world. "He's essentially a child trapped in a man's body. That's how I've always seen him."
