CCTV footage shows the moment the red Ferrari SF90 smashed into a parked car - forcing another two cars to career backwards. Its bonnet was left crippled and parts of the badly-damaged vehicle were left scattered on the street. The head-on collision in Halesowen, in the West Midlands, was captured on camera. BirminghamLive reports how in the 32-second clip, the driver can be seen climbing out of the hypercar's window. He then stands on the pavement as concerned residents come out of their homes. The vehicle was seized by police, who said that when they arrived the car had been abandoned and they could not find the driver. Fire crews were also sent to the scene. Officers are working to identify the driver of the Italian sports car - which goes from zero to 124mph in 6.7 seconds and has a top speed of 211mph.   BirminghamLive readers were stunned after watching the clip, with one person commenting 'good job no-one got hurt'. Another said: "Some people have more money than brains." One reader suggested super cars were dangerous and not designed for UK roads, saying: “These cars should not be sold as handling them is sometimes impossible. Made for speed but not on our roads.” Another said: “Those cars are not designed for average driver or the roads in the UK.” And one reader claimed harsher sentences for driving offences were needed, saying: "You need a proper deterrent and 20-plus years would solve this problem." The incident happened at about 7.40pm on Wednesday, May 25. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "Anyone with information can message us via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk, quoting log 3595 of 25 May, or call 101."
