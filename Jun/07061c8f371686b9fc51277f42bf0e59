Much has been made of the Royal Family's quirky dietary requirements and favourite food over the years. But a royal chef has now revealed the 96-year-old monarch packs a sweet snack during her trips to the capital. German chef Stefan Pappert said: "If she has to go to London, something is packed. "We have a few cookies in our handbag. "She has juices with her and water." According to German news outlet Der Spiegel, Mr Pappert not only takes care of the Queen but also of her house guests, including at Windsor Castle.

Pappert even said the Queen's portions are no longer as large as before but are often a little saltier. He revealed: "We made the food a bit saltier, simply because the taste decreases in old age." According to Mr Pappert's LinkedIn profile, the German chef has been working in the Royal Household since 2017. He has also been the lead chef of Three Lions for Wembley Stadium over the same period. Mr Pappert previously worked at another football ground just 11miles away, serving as lead chef at Arsenal until September 2021. And it turns out Mr Pappert's previous employers are also close to the Duke of Sussex. During an England rugby training session in 2017, the former patron of the RFU reportedly revealed he is gunning for Arsenal when watching football.
