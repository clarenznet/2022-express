Strictly Come Dancing star AJ Odudu put her endless pins on display as she attended day four of Wimbledon 2022. The presenter dazzled as she smiled for the cameras at the star-studded event earlier today. In pictures taken inside the Pimm's No 1 hospitality suite, AJ posed up a storm next to fellow Strictly star Rylan Clark. She paired the thigh split floral minidress with camel peep toe mules, complementing her fabulously summery look.
