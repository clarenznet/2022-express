(“Defiant and unbowed... Boris: I’ll lead party to victory”, June 7).  Can’t they count? Brexiteers won the vote, but Remainers claim it wasn’t a convincing victory. Cowardly MPs called for a vote of no-confidence in the Prime Minister, which was also lost but which they are somehow trying to claim as a win. They weren’t moaning about numbers at the election masterminded by Boris were they? A win by a single point or single goal is still a win, and that’s all that counts, just ask Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti. They’re winners – and so is Boris. Now let him get on with it. Brian Metcalfe, Birmingham ---------------------------------------- Presenters need to bore off with Boris criticism Boris won the vote of confidence, and it’s now time for the Tories to get behind him and get on with the important matters facing the UK. I’m bored with TV presenters, particularly those on Good Morning Britain, continually criticising and trying to find fault with everything he does. They overlook the bigger stories and waste airtime trying to score points from ministers. It’s time to move on and stop boring viewers with biased reporting. Maurice Hickman Petersfield, Hants ---------------------------------------- Was vote sneaky bid to give up our sovereignty? We’ve heard and read of Tory MPs who are ardent Remainers and who want us to rejoin the EU. How many of these “rebels” are Remainers? We should know who they are and who they represent. Was it a vote of no confidence or a way to give up our sovereignty via the back door as Boris would never allow it? Anne Jones, Cheshire ---------------------------------------- People went for Johnson, not the Tory party itself What the MPs who voted against Boris fail to realise is that in the last general election many voted for Boris, not necessarily his party. If Boris is replaced we could get someone wishy-washy like Keir Starmer or Jeremy Hunt. Andrew Tiffin Tiptree, Essex
