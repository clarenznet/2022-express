The pink gown, which featured long sleeves, a pleated skirt and a belt, is currently sold out. Carole combined the dress with a black hat.

Kate wore the same dress in 2021 during a royal visit to Scotland. She swapped the original belt the dress had with a different belt from Boden. But who wore it better? Royal fans took to social media to decide.  Instagram user @courtmanchu said: "Good on her, it suits her and she looks like she’s having a really great time!" Another one, @alessandradeosmatribute, commented: "Sometimes I share clothes with my mum too!" Royal fan @graygreen8 added: "She looks great in that colour!" "Magnifique," user @sabrina_hala_ simply said. However, others thought the dress was "inappropriate" as it was somewhat see-through. Social media user @madame.atmaja said: "She's fabulous, I love her! "But I cannot see a 60s-year-old lady wearing a see-through." Another user, @harleyhayper, said: "Lovely dress but it’s see-through!" Royal watcher @hereandtherewithme commented: "It's see-through... Tasteless and a lack of decorum. "Shouldn't have been allowed in the royal box like that!! No one else wearing see-through..." Royal fan _emma_hurley_ disagreed: "She looks great and can definitely carry off the sheer look, despite being in her 60s. "We can all only hope we look that good at her age!"
