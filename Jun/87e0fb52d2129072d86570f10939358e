Ruth Langsford, 62, who is married to GB News host Eamonn Holmes, 62, wowed as she showed off a smokey eye make-up look featuring glamorous flicks at the corner of each eye. The This Morning veteran looked virtually unrecognisable as she tried out the new look. Clad in a black velour outfit and fluffy animal print slippers, she sat patiently in the make-up chair while her MUA got to work. The star also wore her hair in soft Hollywood waves, complete with a perfectly trimmed fringe to frame her face. "Beautiful @ruthlangsford Ft me ( quasi)!" Ruth's make-up artist, Olivia Davey, captioned the photos, before also thanking @mauriceflynn for the "beaut BTS photo and hair". Fellow showbiz personalities including Rylan Clark were amongst many Ruth's admirers, who took to Instagram to declare her transformation "stunning". The exciting new look comes just days after she and Eamonn celebrated the anniversary of their 12th year of marriage.
