His mother Katarzyna Bastek suffered serious stab wounds and was taken to hospital where she remains in a stable condition. Last night in a statement the family paid tribute to the teenager and said: "He was always a popular child making friends wherever he went due to his friendly and chatty nature. "He always spoke his mind, he was mischievous, funny and a cheeky boy. He loved his Xbox and football, supporting Manchester City." "He was like every other teenage boy and was helpful to so many people, even those he just met.To our family, he's our hero." Greater Manchester Police said a 44-yearold man, from Manchester, was arrested in Kent on suspicion of murder on Friday night. He is believed to be known to the victims.  Detective Chief Inspector Alicia Smith said officers were continuing their investigation and the "arrest has been a huge step in potentially getting a grieving family the answers they so badly need." She said: "A teenage boy who had his whole life ahead of him has tragically lost his life and not only is his mother grieving at the loss of her son, but she is also recovering from what will have been no doubt, hugely traumatic."  DCI Smith added: "The attack has left a community reeling and a family coming to terms with what was an absolutely devastating incident." A person close to Jakub, who is believed to be one of four brothers, said: "Everyone here knew him for being kind and respectful. He was quiet, but he was a protector. He fought for his family. He was an amazing person. He was a hero and he should be remembered as one."
