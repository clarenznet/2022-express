The video, which has racked up more than one million views, was filmed on Monday evening at Harlow A&E, run by Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust in Essex. Health Secretary Sajid Javid was shown the clip on BBC Breakfast yesterday. The nurse was heard saying: "We've currently got 170 patients in the department, there are 90 patients waiting to be seen at the moment. Our current wait time for a doctor is seven-and-a-half hours." "I will estimate by the time I go home in the morning at 8am some of you will still be here waiting for a doctor because the waits will get up to 12 or 13 hours." "There are currently no beds in the trust...we will do our best to make you comfortable, we will do our best to look after you but please don't expect you will be going directly to a ward, because that might not happen." Mr Javid said the NHS was seeing "very high levels of demand" in the aftermath of the pandemic. He added: "We know already from our NHS estimates, we think some 11 to 13 million people stayed away from the NHS because of the pandemic." "Many of those people are coming forward, many of those to A&E, and we're seeing very high levels of demand. That is a real challenge for the NHS across the system." The video was shared on Twitter on Monday night by Gary Sitton. He wrote: "My son-in-law visited A&E after being involved in a road traffic accident. "He left in pain after hearing the nurse's announcement. Others verbally abused her." "This is our NHS on its knees after 12 years of underfunding." Official figures show a record 24,000 people are waiting 12 or more hours every month - three times the NHS target. Stephanie Lawton, chief operating officer at the Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, said: "We are experiencing extremely high demand. The public can help us by using the NHS 111 service for non-urgent cases."
