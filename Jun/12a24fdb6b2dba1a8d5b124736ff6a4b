Ruth Langsford, 62, showed off her brand new hair extensions as she shared a behind-the-scenes look into her transformation. The This Morning presenter looked fabulous as she filmed the process that made her hair look longer and fuller, shaking up her signature bob haircut. The new Instagram post comes after Ruth gave concerned fans an update on her husband Eamonn’s health after the broadcaster was rushed to A&E. Speaking to ITV’s Lorraine Kelly, Ruth said: "He still had his stick with him because he's got these discs in his back, but he was out, he was smiling and it was a beautiful day."
