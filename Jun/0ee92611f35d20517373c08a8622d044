It later emerged the driver, Harold Hiscocks, 63, who'd never had an accident in 18 years of driving, had blacked out behind the wheel. 73 years ago (1949) US scientists launched the first primate into space on a V-2 rocket. Albert II, a rhesus macaque, survived the flight and reached 83 miles into space but he died on impact when the parachute failed to open. Primates were launched before human spaceflight so experts could research the impact on the body. 40 years ago (1982) a ceasefire was declared in the Falklands War as 7,000 Argentine troops fled their positions outside the capital Port Stanley leaving the 8,000-strong British force, under Major-General Jeremy Moore, to break through the defence line and march into the island's capital. Some 649 Argentine personnel, 255 British troops and three Falkland Islanders died during the conflict.
