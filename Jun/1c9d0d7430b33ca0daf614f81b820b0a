Until baffled doctors diagnosed his illness, George Lea constantly had to wear a mask, lay awake in severe pain and dared not give wife Karen a peck, fearing he was infectious. Birmingham Dental Hospital found that George, 69, is only the eighth person in the UK to have exfoliative cheilitis, a form of eczema of the lips. After being given cream to control the incurable condition, he feels “50 per cent better” and is looking forward to his 41st wedding anniversary. George, of Tamworth, Staffs, who first noticed problems in Tenerife in 2017, said: “Lumps like boils developed. “I looked like I’d had a stroke, but nobody could tell me what was wrong.” Delighted Karen, 63, said: “He can give me a goodnight kiss now!” A hospital spokesman said: “We’re very pleased to have been able to treat this gentleman successfully.”
