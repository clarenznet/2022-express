Paul Kershaw, 51, has managed to offset his energy costs by selling back the excess power from his electric car at a profit. The Cambridge man took part in OVO Energy’s V2G (Vehicle to Grid) scheme, which he is still using a year after the trial ended.   The system involves a special vehicle charger and app, which determines the normal charge that a person needs for their daily activities. It charges up the vehicle during off-peak times, when energy is cheaper and more likely to come from renewable sources. Then any excess energy not needed by the car is sold back to the grid during busy periods. Mr Kershaw bought his energy at 30p and sold it back at 38p, saving £71 a month on energy bills.

"I was exporting more energy to the grid than I was using myself - so carrying this profit into the summer months, where I wasn’t using as much energy, I wouldn’t have to be paying anything.” Over the past 12 months, he has spent on average £93 a month on EV charging and raked in £164 through exporting the energy back to the grid - a saving of £71 per month. The motorist is also generating energy through solar panels, and has sometimes made more than £200 a month through the scheme.  The app comes with the option to boost the provision for the car, if the user needs to go on a long journey. The V2G scheme does however come with some high initial costs. It costs around £4,000 for the installation and hardware, which was funded in Mr Kershaw’s case by the OVO innovation fund. He also bought a Nissan Leaf so he could take part, as this is the recommended vehicle for the project as it has a bi-directional battery. He previously had a BMW i3 electric car, which he used mostly to go out to walk his dog twice a day. Mr Kershaw said: “I now consider the car to be a part of my household energy scheme as opposed to a separate entity to the house. “During busy periods when I’m using a lot of electricity, it takes power out of the battery in my car and puts it into the house, covering my domestic energy needs. “After that, I send any excess energy to the grid, to be used elsewhere. “This means that instead of creating a demand on the energy grid at times when I’m using lots of energy, I’m instead using energy obtained at off peak hours, and not overwhelming the grid. “I’m actually helping alleviate the demand on the grid, by using extra energy that the app takes from my battery.” He was also pleased to see in a summary from the app that he was 99.1 percent green in his energy usage. He said: “My experience has been overwhelmingly positive, and I would definitely say OVO’s V2G scheme has helped me focus on living a more sustainable lifestyle, without incurring stress about the costs of doing so. “On a daily basis, I can see which hours the car is exporting and importing to the grid via the app, which is so interesting to me, to see when those peaks and troughs happen.” To find out more about OVO’s vehicle-to-grid trial and to keep an eye out for registration for the upcoming second trial, check out https://www.ovoenergy.com/electric-cars/vehicle-to-grid-charger. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/ovo+energy/FMfcgzGpFgmLZsvdRLQjzVdkSqZJWmpk?compoas%20a%20participant%20of%20OVO%E2%80%99s%20vehicle-to-grid%20trial,%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20first%20and%20largest%20domestic%20scheme.%20To%20find%20out%20more%20about%20the%20trial%20and%20to%20keep%20an%20eye%20out%20for%20registration%20for%20the%20upcoming%20second%20trial,%20check%20out%20https://www.ovoenergy.com/electric-cars/vehicle-to-grid-chargerse=DmwnWsdHGvffZpWrrkXvMcrmtqhLZSVbVZvwWBHmWLktPvqWDbnWzHFlJwJMHPlbnkwxxfVCdQQB
