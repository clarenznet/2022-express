Last night, the nation was treated to performances by the likes of Queen and Adam Lambert and Elton John to mark the penultimate day of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. However, Meghan and Harry did not attend the event as they were celebrating the first birthday of their daughter Lilibet "privately". Commenting on the Sussexes lack of attendance, Daily Mail Diary Editor Richard Eden tweeted: "This is such a good show #PlatinumPartyatthePalace How sad for #PrinceHarry and #Meghan if they were invited but chose not to attend."
