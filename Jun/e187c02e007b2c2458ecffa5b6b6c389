Angus Robertson said Nicola Sturgeon would soon detail a new “route map” to breaking up the Union. The First Minister, below, is publishing a series of papers they say will help mount a “full, frank and constructive debate”. But she refused to explain how Indyref2 could go ahead if Westminster refused to grant permission via a section 30 order, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated would be the Government’s intention. Mr Robertson told the BBC: “I’m not going to get into speculation of what happens a number of steps down the road.” Commons Leader Mark Spencer told MPs a gap of 25 years from the last vote in 2014 would be appropriate, putting the next one at 2039.
