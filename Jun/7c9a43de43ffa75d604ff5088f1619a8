The second is doctors prescribing over the phone. It's not rocket science to realise that people are going to be misdiagnosed. It's a highly dangerous practice. Caring doctors trained to see and care for patients are being hemmed down by endless paperwork and practice managers. Most people treat themselves and don't bother with the doctor at all, so stop passing all the blame on to people who cannot get to the doctor because they're 28th in the queue. Day after day I read that people cannot afford to feed their children, says Harry Baker, from Sleaford, Lincs. It annoys me that we the public are now expected to fund school meals. Maybe we should look a little closer at the way people are milking the system, with some people drive to food banks claiming poverty though they have mobile phones, for them and their children, and decent hairdos. All of these items are paid for by direct debit, but they cannot feed their children? Shame on them. The Partygate saga, possibly causing the PM to lose his job, must be giving the rest of the world the biggest laugh they have had for a long time, says Geoff Manning, from Lower Kingswood, Surrey. We have a man who has had a pretty dreadful two years with Covid, the cost-of-living crisis, and Ukraine, during which he has shown himself to be a true leader. Now some colleagues are calling for his resignation because he had a bit of birthday cake and a drink or two at his home, which is also his place of work. Geoff Manning, Lower Kingswood, Surrey Why do we always turn on the Government to bail out private businesses?, asks Peter Rushton, from Chorley, Lancs. The airport authorities are responsible for their business and all this blame game against the government is not on. When the pandemic hit airlines, authorities looked at the cost of running their businesses and panicked, getting rid of thousands of workers. When the pandemic started to recede they sat back instead of developing a re-employment strategy.
