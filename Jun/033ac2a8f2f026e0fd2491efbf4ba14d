Harvested wheat is trapped in silos and cannot be moved from the country’s Black Sea ports due to Russia’s military action. Around 400 million people are fed by Ukraine’s wheat crops and East Africa imports 90 percent of its grain from Russia and the Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said “people are suffering hunger” everywhere because of Kremlin tactics, adding: “This is a real war crime. You cannot use the hunger of people as a weapon of war.” Russia has denied responsibility and blamed sanctions imposed on Moscow that have pushed up food prices. The UN wants to make an EU-backed deal with Russia to reopen the ports in return for letting Putin’s country export fertiliser and food. Poland and Romania are to adapt their railways to help further grain exports.
