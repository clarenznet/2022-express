The resident has pleaded with builders who they have blamed for using the skip. The homeowner claims builders have used it to get rid of commercial waste at their address in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The angry note said: “That is enough!!! If you need a skip for your job then hire one. Cost me £140. PRIVATE USE. Two days fly-tipping my skip. Take this piece I have no room and no car!!! SELFISH!” Under the current law dumping waste in someone else’s skip could be prosecuted as fly-tipping, Birmingham Live reports. Those responsible could be taken to court under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and offenders can be given a £400 Fixed Penalty Notice for small-scale fly-tipping. In serious cases, prosecution could lead to Crown Court and could end in either potential fines of up to £50,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  Fly-tipping should not be confused with littering which is the dumping of small individual items such as food wrappers or cigarette ends. Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of larger items, which include mixed materials such as black bin bags full of rubbish or furniture. Any instances of fly-tipping can be reported to your local council.
