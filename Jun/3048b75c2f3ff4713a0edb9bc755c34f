It beat the well-known huge theme parks of Thorpe Park, Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures. Just a few miles from the Cornish border, the Milky Way Adventure Park is just one mile from the fishing village of Clovelly. Visitors riding the Cosmic Typhoon coaster should keep an eye out for incredible views of the coast and Dartmoor. The family run park started life as a farm and has grown into a theme park following £2million of investment. Despite the investment the park is still run by the Stanbury family who opened it and visitors are likely to be welcomed by a family member when they arrive. Attractions include the Gravity Rider doughnut slide, the Cosmic Caterpillar coaster, dodgems and a bird of prey centre. The family-friendly park is a bargain day out costing just £15 for a ticket with offers available. One visitor wrote on Tripadvisor: “Amazing day. What a great little find. Lovely place and things for all ages.” Alton Towers, Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Drayton Manor theme park also made the top 20 in the world. Alton Towers, located in Staffordshire, is run by Merlin Entertainments and even has a spa for guests. Blackpool Pleasure Beach is a top summer spot with a huge range of rides for beach thrillseekers. 11. Gardaland Park, Italy 12. Futuroscope, France 13. Alton Towers Theme Park, United Kingdom 14.
