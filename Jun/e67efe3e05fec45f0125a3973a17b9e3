After Chunkz earned a penalty for the team, he was noticeably frustrated as Mark proceeded to stride past and take the penalty himself. Viewers quickly picked up on the tension between the two players, as well as commentators Sam Matterface and Iain Stirling. Several ITV viewers accused Mark of unfairly taking Chunkz's chance to score. The 26-year-old YouTube star won a spot-kick just before half-time, which would help England equalise against World XI. He managed to get a foul from TikTok star Noah Beck and prepared to take the shot. Jamie Carragher then called him over though, where he informed him that former Crawley defender Mark would be taking the penalty. Viewers were surprised to see Mark taking the penalty as a furious Chunkz stood behind him, glaring at the camera and shrugging.

"Mark is a West Ham fan, he's buzzing to be playing at their home." Iain remarked: "I tell you what, if he misses this now..." As Chunkz signalled to the crowd his confusion, Sam added; "Chunkz wanted it, he's ripping up the crowd." Mark managed to score but while the team celebrated, Chunkz was visibly annoyed by the decision. As half-time commenced, Chunkz walked past hosts Dermot O'Leary and Alex Scott. He told the two he wanted to take the penalty and that it had been "decided" Mark would instead take it. Looking disappointed, he walked away to rejoin his team. DON'T MISS...
