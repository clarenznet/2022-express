President Erdogan has agreed a deal to clear the way for Finland and Sweden to join the NATO alliance in a huge blow to Vladimir Putin. He confirmed he had met with his European leaders to address security concerns before a memorandum was signed by the three countries. But Meral Aksener, head of Turkey's opposition IYI Party, said the deal was unacceptable and that Ankara would have no "NATO card" to play if the three-way mechanism did not work. She told MPs: "This signature that the government gave without any concrete developments from Sweden and Finland is unfortunately a compromise that is not in line with the interest of our country."
