The FSA outlined the steps Co-op would take to keep their shoppers safe. The agency explained: "Co-op is recalling the above products. "Point of sale notices will be displayed in all retail stores that are selling these products. "These notices explain to customers why the products are being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the products." The FSA also issued advice to customers: "If you have bought the above products do not eat them. "Instead return them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund. "If you are self-isolating or shielding please contact the Co-op Customer Careline on 0800 068 6727." Co-op apologised for any inconvenience caused to shoppers. Why do food recalls happen and are they important? The FSA explained: "If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). "The FSA issues Product Withdrawal Information Notices and Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food. "In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers."
