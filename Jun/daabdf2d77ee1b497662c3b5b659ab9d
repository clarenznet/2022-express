As Brits return to work after an extra long Bank Holiday weekend, Wordle is here to make everything better. Indeed, Wordle 352 is available for the next 24-hours, so head on over to the website to make sure you keep your winning streak alive. If you're struggling to maintain that precious winning streak, simply head to the bottom of the page for a selection of spoiler-free hints and clues for the June 6 puzzle. An ideal companion for the daily commute, Wordle tasks players with figuring out a five letter word in just six attempts. Fortunately, there are ways to whittle it down and actually solve the puzzle pretty quickly. It's all about paying close attention to the colour of the tiles after each guess. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, as well as your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your precious winning streak.
