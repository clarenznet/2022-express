According to the poll of 1,500 likely voters for the Washington DC based Democracy Institute, 54 percent said they would prefer Trump to be President now compared to a woeful 43 percent for Biden. It comes as Biden is mired in an economic crisis and has been accused of  "a failure of leadership" which is seeing Americans turn their backs on Ukraine. According to the Democracy Institute/Express US monthly US tracker poll, almost three-quarters of the country (73 percent), believe America is heading in the wrong direction under Biden. He has not been helped by a national shortage of baby formula, even though he has ordered emergency supplies with 61 percent blaming him for the crisis. A depressed US electorate also appears to expect the worst under Biden's leadership, with 63 percent expecting the US to enter a recession. Inflation, economy and jobs are all the top issues of concern for Americans according to the findings. The poll says that six in 10 Americans think Biden has handled the economy poorly. And more than half of Americans (54 percent) are unhappy with Biden’s record as President and believe he is incompetent. In contrast, the door appears to be open for a Trump return after the controversial 2020 election in which he and his supporters claim the Democrats cheated in. Almost two-thirds (65 percent) don't believe Biden will secure a second term in 2024. When matched against Trump, the former President comes out on top by 48 percent to 43 percent. Trump also beats the most likely Democrat candidates with Hilary Clinton repeating her 2016 loss by 47 percent to 41 percent according to the poll and Vice President Kamala Harris losing by a crushing 48 percent to 37 percent.

The poll suggests a 50 percent to 41 percent vote in favour of the Republicans for the House of Representatives, giving them 264 seats to 171. In the Senate race, the Republicans come out on top 48 percent to 42 percent giving them control of the upper House by 54 to 46. This heightens the chances of impeachment proceedings starting against Biden over allegations surrounding the business activities of his son Hunter.

He said: "Each thing they are trying [to gain popularity]] like Ukraine [war] and abortion [row with the Supreme Court] so far to change the narrative of the issues and how people view the administration, nothing has stuck in a positive way. "They keep digging and it gets deeper for them." He went on: "The view is that Biden is now inept and incompetent." People are looking a year and a half in and saying ‘how they do stuff and what they seem to be behind the curve on and what they tell us, how they seem to be wrong about everything.’ "They are now overwhelmingly viewed as incompetent." "When you are viewed as not up to the job, not competent enough then that is tough." He said the poll also confirmed while Trump was divisive personally, his Presidency and policies were popular among Americans. He said: "Trump was actually a fairly popular President, true to say personally he wasn’t popular even though his core supporters love him. A lot of people hate him. "But his Presidency in terms of his individual policies and what he was attempting to do was either popular to begin with or became popular as people saw the results of his Presidency."
