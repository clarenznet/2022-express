Jane Seymour, 71, looked fabulous in red today as she visited Oxford University. The former Bond Girl was joined by her partner, David Green, as they enjoyed a “fun date night”. Jane took to Instagram to show an insight into their outing, during which she donned a spectacular floor-length red dress and David looked dapper in a suit. She paired her elegant one-shoulder gown with a matching patterned wrap, a pair of metallic platform heels and a white clutch.
