The crash on the northbound carriageway between Junctions 34 and 35 was first reported just before 8.30am. Traffic was then delayed while emergency services closed all three lanes to respond to the incident.  National Highways said just before noon that all lanes had been reopened "following recovery and clear up of debris from an earlier collision". It estimated 50 minute delays and seven miles of congestion back to Junction 33, the turn-off for the Preston Lancaster Road. At 10am, 30 minutes of delays and 3 miles of congestion had built up in the wake of the horror collision. Emergency responders were later able to reopen one of the lanes while they continued to clear up the crash, allowing traffic to move slowly past.   However, it is only after noon that all lanes were fully reopened so that the congestion could start to ease. LacashireLive reports three vehicles were involved in the crash. The status of the occupants of the vehicles that became entangled has yet to be made public by the emergency services.   Lancashire Constabulary and the North West Ambulance Service have been contacted for comment. Junction 34 is the turn-off for Lancaster, Morcambe and Heysham, while Junction 35 is the slip road connecting the M6 to the A6 near Carnforth. As of 1.20pm, there is some remaining congestion further up the motorway, but the traffic has otherwise cleared, according to National Highways data.
