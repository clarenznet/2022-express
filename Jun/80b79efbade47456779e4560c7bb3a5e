A viral video titled "MEDIA SHOCK! Harry & Meghan Have Finally Signed The DIVORCE Papers" sent royal fans into a frenzy following the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The video, claimed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had signed divorce papers and that Harry felt "tightly controlled by Meghan." The post is heavily critical of the Duchess, attributing many claims to anonymous sources and adding the caveat: "the signing of the divorce papers of Harry and Meghan is just a rumor in the media. The royal couple have yet to confirm." But these claims have been branded "baseless" by Pulitzer-winning fact-checking website PolitiFact, which said: "A video in the Facebook post claims to offer up juicy details, such as that Harry is back in England while Meghan stays in the United States with the couple's two children, but it does not provide any credible evidence that any of this is actually true. Claims that Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, divorced are baseless." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
