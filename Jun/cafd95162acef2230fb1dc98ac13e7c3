Prime Video fans can take advantage of a brilliant deal running right now to add some new movies and boxsets to their watchlist. Right now Amazon is running a money-saving offer on the popular StarzPlay channel. Usually this add-on costs £5.99 but right now you grab this channel for £1.99 a month for three months. StarzPlay offers plenty of exclusive content you'd otherwise have to pay separately to watch such as The Great, Power Book and Outlander. If you like the sound of this deal though you'll need to act quick as it isn't around forever. The StarzPlay offer runs out after June 30.  To watch content on a Prime Video channel you'll need to already be a subscriber to Amazon Prime. The flagship Amazon subscription service bundles in the Prime Video library of movies and boxsets, plus speedy Prime delivery, access to Amazon Music, the Prime Reading library and more. If you're not already a subscriber to Amazon Prime you can sign up to a 30 day free trial.  Besides the deal running on StarzPlay, you can also make a saving on a BritBox subscription. This streaming service from BBC and ITV offers a library full of essential, classic British TV shows such as Poirot, Broadchurch and original shows like the new Spitting Image. BritBox like StarzPlay usually costs £5.99 a month but right now you can pick up a subscription for £2.99 a month for three months. This deal runs out sooner than the StarzPlay deal, with the BritBox special offer ending on June 12.
