Ruth Langsford, 62, has taken to Instagram with a happy anniversary post to beau Eamonn Holmes. The star shared a picture of the two as they were holidaying in a seaside location.  Eamonn was dressed in a light blue, summer shirt as he accessorised with circular dark shades. Meanwhile, Ruth wore tortoiseshell shades, with her hair in a chic up-do. She said in the caption: “Happy Anniversary my love @eamonnholmes. Loved you then Love you still Always have Always will.” It comes after the GB News presenter was rushed to hospital in “excruciating pain” at the start of June and spent some time off-air. He said his back injury may “never be fixed” ahead of his return to the presenting role.
