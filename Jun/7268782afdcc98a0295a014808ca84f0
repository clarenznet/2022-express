Charles Leclerc starts from pole for round eight of the championship with Sergio Perez alongside him on the front row at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix today.  Max Verstappen was unable to beat his team-mate on Saturday for the second weekend running and will line up next just in front of Carlos Sainz. Lewis Hamilton has claimed his back is a ‘real mess’ as Mercedes' bouncing issues continue. The car has been struggling with bouncing all weekend with Hamilton admitting he felt a ‘bit sore’ on Friday. However, it appears his pain got worse on Saturday and Hamilton revealed it was not an issue Mercedes could fix.  Meanwhile, Toto Wolff has claimed he is hoping Ferrari and Red Bull both crash to give Mercedes a chance of securing victory. The team principal warned the gap to the cars in front was big, suggesting the Silver Arrows will not be able to compete unless cars ahead make a mistake. The slowest Red Bull and Ferrari cars were almost a second faster than George Russell in qualifying yesterday. Max Verstappen has also fired a warning to Ferrari, claiming the team’s race pace could be enough to compete with Charles Leclerc. He warned their long run pace ‘should be quite good’ and only blamed tiny mistakes for not grabbing pole.
