Katie Holmes, 43, strolled the streets of New York City in an all-black ensemble featuring a crop top and wide-leg trousers. The movie star, who first rose to international fame after appearing in the TV drama Dawson's Creek, had thrown a casual brown cardigan over the top of the outfit, accented by red pockets. Katie, the former husband of Top Gun star Tom Cruise, had wowed on the red carpet just days earlier with new beau Bobby Wooten III, who she has been publicly dating since April. The pair had attended the premiere of her latest film, Alone Together, at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on Tuesday. While she was decidedly less glammed up during the weekend's solo outing in the city, she still perfectly embodied casual chic - and onlookers could scarcely take their eyes off the star.
