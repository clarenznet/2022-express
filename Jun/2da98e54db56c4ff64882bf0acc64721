Beekeeper Damson Tregaskis was filmed trying to capture the bees outside Costa Coffee in MediaCityUK, Salford on June 7. Damson, who goes by Hive5Mcr on Twitter, opted to wear a protective suit but no gloves. Turning to onlookers, she joked: "Does anyone fancy giving me a hand?" The clip shows her stood amongst a swarm of the insects, which fly around forming in colonies on a tree branch, reports Manchester Evening News. It was shared on Twitter, where Den Glanzig wrote: "Wasn't expecting this when I popped to MediaCity UK for my lunch." He added: "It caught me off guard at first. I didn't notice them at first as I walk past those trees everyday. "On the way back past later on, the lady was there collecting them so I stopped to watch." Damson, who runs Hive5Â which offers offers community engagement events and beekeeper mentoring classes, said she collected the swarm of bees and rehomed them in an apiary in her Stockport garden. She said: "There was a swarm of bees at MediaCity that someone notified me about. "In the video I'm collecting them from the tree then setting them up in our home apiary in Stockport. "I'm a professional beekeeper and usually manage beehives for corporate clients, as well as doing beekeeping courses and experiences." She added that she will be sharing updates on her Twitter page. According to the British Beekeepers Association, a honeybee colony will swam to reproduce when the old queen leaves a colony with some of the bees. They leave their hive and find a spot to wait in until scout bees decide on a new home for the colony. Most honey bee swarms are not aggressive, but people are asked to stay away from them as a precaution. It usually happens on sunny days between the months of May and July.
