Deborah, who is having end of life care for bowel cancer, watched the runners and riders from the grandstand with brother Benjamin and his fiancee Ashley Hall. But her smile was the biggest winner of the day. Her visit followed her trip to the Glyndebourne opera in East Sussex last weekend where she said she was “trying to see a few of her favourites one last time.” She added: “The feeling of making it to something you didn’t think possible, having put make-up on, donning new shoes, with the sunshine smiling, well then it’s all worth it!” The weather obliged for the A-listers and their plus-ones, with many striking cool, stylish notes as temperatures hit 81F (27C). This Morning host Holly Willoughby was pretty in pink in a striking figure-hugging dress with a matching hat and clutch. And former Strictly star Oti Mabuse was a vision in emerald green and a pink hat on day two of the event. Actress Helen George looked picture perfect in a vintage-style embroidered number. While model and special constable Penny Lancaster wowed with a splash of purple as rocker husband Sir Rod Stewart stayed at home. Judy Finnigan and their husband Richard Madeley mirrored each other in shades. They were joined in the VIP enclosure by comedian Jason Manford and wife Lucy Dyke and Dermot O’Leary with his wife Dee Koppang. As per tradition, the Royal­ family led the way as they arrived by horse-drawn carriage. Prince Charles was joined by his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, also attended for the second day running, wearing a cornflower blue dress and matching hat. They were joined by Princess Beatrice and husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. It is hoped that the Queen will be able to attend today’s Ladies’ Day.
