They had a look inside and it was horrific, screwed them up for life. I won’t say what was in it so as not to trigger anyone.” Another commented: “Why would you put it on social media for anyone to go and grab it before ringing the police to collect it… If it’s been dumped pretty obvious the owner doesn’t know it’s there.” One person said the suitcase could not have fallen from the aircraft and suggested “it’s been taken by mistake”.
