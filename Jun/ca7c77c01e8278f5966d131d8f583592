As for jewellery, she kept it minimal with a pair of gold studs. Naturally, she wore her statement signature ring by Karen Hallam. This unique oval ring has become more synonymous with Queen Letizia than her own engagement ring as she is rarely spotted without it. The ring ranges from 110 euros-1,100 euros (around £94-940) depending on size and material. The Queen's favourite jewel is available in silver, gold-plated silver, and solid gold. Letizia wore her hair down with a middle part in a classic style. READ MORE: Queen Letizia stuns in florals, £219 pumps and 'signature' ring Beside the monarch stood First Lady Jill Biden. She opted for a red jacket and skirt combo. The jacket had an interesting feature in that it was shorter at the front and longer at the back. It also boasted buttons in variations of gold and silver. Jill wore a pair of slingback nude heels which featured a small bow on each foot. She wore a gold bangle on each wrist and also had a pretty French manicure. As for her hair, Jill wore her blonde tresses down in loose waves. Both Letizia and Jill donned a face mask too.
