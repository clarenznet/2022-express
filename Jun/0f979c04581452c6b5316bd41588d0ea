Actress, model and designer Eva Mendes looked absolutely sensational in a strappy gold backless Gucci number which perfectly complemented her glowing skin tone. She had slipped on the floor length gown in celebration of the Spring 2006 Gucci fashion show. The event had raised money for Children's Action Network and Westside Children's Center and was held in Beverly Hills, one of the most exclusive areas in California. Eva, who is married to Ryan Gosling, clutched a sparkly silver handbag with fringing details and gave her best pout for the cameras as she strode the red carpet on behalf of the brand. The ultra-glamorous actress still looks a mere fraction of her age, but these unearthed snaps provide an insight into her earlier years in showbiz.
