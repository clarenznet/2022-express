Two lanes were closed on the eastbound carriageway at around 7.15am this morning, between Junctions 7 and 8, near Warrington. North West Ambulance Service confirmed to local media that two people had been taken to hospital following the incident with "minor injuries".  While emergency services were in attendance, four miles of congestion and 40 minutes of delays built on the approach. The attending ambulance service told Manchester Evening News that eight people had been assessed at the scene, but only two needed hospital treatment. By 9am, National Highways had announced that the incident had been cleared and the lanes reopened so that traffic could clear. However, just ten minutes before it had advisedÂ there were "long delays" of an hour, with congestion all the way back to Junction 6.  That traffic is now slowly clearing, but poses a major blockage for morning commuters into Manchester using the motorway. Junction 7 of the M62 is the Rainhill Stoops interchange, outside of Liverpool. Meanwhile, Junction 8 is the first turn off for Warrington. Cheshire Police said in a statement they believed four vehicles had been involved in the horror crash.  It added that three people had been treated at the scene by paramedics for minor injuries. To only pile on the Monday morning misery, another crash at a junction of the M60 Manchester ring road this morning left one lane blocked. The incident to the south-west of the major city caused long delays and congestion.
