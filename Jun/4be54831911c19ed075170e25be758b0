Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was the epitome of chic as the age-defying beauty headed into the Global Studios ahead of her morning show on Heart FM today. The broadcaster flashed the flesh as she put her legs on full display in an eye-popping dress. The mum-of-two was all smiles as she opted for a short shift dress, designed by Karen Millen. The gorgeous green number featured padded shoulders and a round neck. The dress was accessorised with two outer pockets and a thigh-high split which gave a glimpse of her toned legs. The beauty teamed her look with a pair of nude stilettos and protected her eyes with a pair of sunglasses. Amanda smiled for the candid shots as she wowed in the gorgeous design.
