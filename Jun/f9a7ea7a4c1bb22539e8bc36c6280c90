RMT workers will be joined by striking ASLEP members as well as GMB union members from St George's Hospital in South London. The three unions are organising a display outside the hospital before marching into Tooting town centre. GMB Region Organiser Helen O'Connor said the workers are "all in the same boat" adding: "We expect the march on Tooting to be well attended and we want the public to know just how badly these vital hospital workers are being treated."
