KitKat arrived at the RSPCA's Hillfield Animal Home in Stretton, Burton upon Trent, when her previous owner was no longer able to care for her. The nine-year-old cat, who is thought to have spent most of her life living outside, had cancerous growths on her ears and had to have the tips removed. The black-and-white moggie has since developed a bald patch on her back and vets believe the cancer has spread. The RSPCA has now launched a special appeal to find a loving foster home for KitKat to spend her remaining days being spoiled. Despite her diagnosis, she is described as friendly, happy and affectionate. KitKat's condition is not currently affecting her quality of life. Cyan Hulland, from the RSPCA centre, said: “Despite her treatment and everything she’s been through, KitKat has got a big personality and loves fuss and attention. "She'll happily sit on or next to you while you stroke her but will walk away when she wants to be left alone. “We’re applying sunscreen to her skin daily, particularly in this current hot spell, and we’d urge other pet owners to take similar precautions to avoid their pets becoming sunburnt.

"She’s a very special cat who is still enjoying life and we think receiving palliative care in a foster home, where she’ll be loved and adored for however long she has left, is going to be the best option for her. “We appreciate it’s not an easy thing for someone to do, but we really hope there’s a special person out there who is willing to take KitKat on and provide her with much-needed comfort and security - out of a cattery environment - in her latter stage of life.” DON'T MISSElderly rescue dog struggling in kennels desperate to find loving homeKittens rescued after being born in gutterRescue dog overlooked as adopters put off by age and health issues KitKat could live with children and other cats but not with dogs.
