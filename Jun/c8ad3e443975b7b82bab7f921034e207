Owners across Britain have dressed their furry friends up in patriotic and royal-inspired costumes to celebrate the 96-year-old monarch's seventieth year on the throne. The Queen loves dogs and is well known for having corgis throughout her decades on the throne - she currently has three corgis and one dorgi. In 2021, when Prince Philip was first hospitalised, the monarch was given two corgi puppies, which she named Fergus and Muick. Corgis have even played a starring role in the Jubilee celebrations this weekend as images of the short-legged pooches adorn commemorative ornaments, pillows, mugs and biscuits. Sculptures of the Queen's favourite dog breed have been installed around the streets of central London.  A dog was even used in the Trooping the Colour parade. Irish wolfhound Seamus - the official regimental mascot of the Irish Guards - marched alongside the perfectly synchronised soldiers dressed in a regal red cape. Drummer Adam Walsh, who is Seamus’s handler, said it's "a real privilege" to be part of the march. Ahead of the celebration, he said: "When it comes to the day, it’s all going to pay off. A lot of the lads have bigger parts to play than me and Seamus, but me and him still need to get it all correct."

I’m the one who’s nervous, so he’s going to be the one who keeps me on track." Royal fan's pups even got to celebrate their own Jubilee event - Dogstival - which welcomed thousands of dogs to Broadlands Park, in Hampshire. The excitable pooches got to take part in canine-friendly activities across four arenas including an adventure playground and a pool fit for dogs.
