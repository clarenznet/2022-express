Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, didn’t waste any time in wishing her husband Michael Douglas, 77, a Happy Father’s Day in a sweet post this afternoon.  The Legend of Zorro actress took to Instagram to share a black and white image of the dad-of-three daringly leaping into a swimming pool with his children.  Putting on a brave face while the kids screamed mid-jump, Michael looked much younger than his years while enjoying some family time.  Catherine captioned the adorable picture: “Happy Father’s Day Michael!”  Catherine shares two children with her husband Michael - Dylan, 21, and Carys, 19, while the Basic Instinct actor also shares an older son, Cameron, with his ex-wife Diandra Luker.
