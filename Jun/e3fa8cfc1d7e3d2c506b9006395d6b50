Victoria Beckham put on a chic display in an alll-black outfit as she attended Le Papier (The Paper) Simon Porte Jacquemus' Fashion Show yesterday. The designer, 48, put on a smart display in a black lace mini dress which she paired with a pair of thigh-high heels. The star's toned abs could be seen peeping through a sheer lace panel while she wore her sunkissed brown tresses in loose curls around her face. Taking to her Instagram, the mum of four showcased her fashionable outfit ahead of the show, writing: "Before @jacquemus wearing #VBPSS23." Victoria snapped the pic in an airy, light-filled room in the South of France ahead of attending the show on salt flats outside of Arles. It comes as Victoria admitted to Grazia magazine that she wants to "feel sexy again" following the Covid pandemic.
