Natalie Elphicke spoke as the official number crossing the English Channel reached 2,079 this month alone. That includes 321 people picked up at sea on Saturday. They were brought into Dover harbour throughout the day by Border Force vessels following seven incidents. Mrs Elphicke, Dover's MP said: "These shocking figures underline yet again why urgent action is needed." "It's disappointing that the efforts being made by the Government to save lives and stop the people traffickers are being undermined by people who should know better." "They should think again and support the action being taken to bring these treacher- ous journeys to an end." Mrs Elphicke added: "Let's not forget that these criminal smuggling gangs have a callous disregard for everyone." "Too many lives have been lost in doomed attempts to cross the English Channel. It needs to end." The Government's first flight transferring people who have reached our shores to Rwanda was grounded by the European Court for Human Rights on Tuesday. It came in a week when 1,623 Channel migrants were picked up, taking this year's total to 11,643. Government figures show 28,526 people made the crossing last year, compared with 8,410 in 2020. Saturday was the 22nd anniversary of 58 Chinese migrants suffocating in a lorry at Dover after fruitlessly banging on the sides for help. Eight traffickers were jailed.
