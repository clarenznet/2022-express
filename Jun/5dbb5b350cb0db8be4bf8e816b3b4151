Christie Brinkley, who rose to fame as a Cover girl model, flaunted her incredible physique wearing a blue bikini in a new Instagram post she shared on Tuesday. The 68-year-old model posed on a cabana which was decked out with branches and driftwood, while showing off her long legs and toned abs. The beauty was promoting her organic wine brand called Bellissima which is sold on the popular shopping channel, QVC. The age-defying beauty donned a two-piece bikini where she had a straw sun hat beside her. In view of her 786,000 followers, she captioned the post: "I’m still working on my Driftwood Cabana and my bikini body… so If Im going to have a cocktail it’s def going to be my #zerosugar #zerocarb @bellissimaprosecco.
