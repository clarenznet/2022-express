With Boris Johnson determined to cut 91,000 from Whitehall's 475,000 staff to save Â£3.5billion, data seen by the Daily Express shows that almost 10,000 working days have been lost since 2019 with no doctor sign-offs. But only three out of 14 Whitehall departments gave a full response to the requests meaning that the true number of such days could be more than 100,000. Employees can take up to seven days off without a doctor's verification but this was relaxed to 28 days during the pandemic for public workers and those in the private sector, where sick rates are thought to be far lower. The Department for Education did not have the data required but reported 45,578 days lost in excess of seven days in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years. The Department for Work and Pensions reported 757,177 days were lost from absences of seven days or more in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years but also did not specify if sick notes were provided. It was the same with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which lost 9,219 days in excess of seven days. John O'Connell, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: "People are sick to the back teeth of civil servants being out of the office." "If bureaucrats are not just pulling a sickie, they should have a note to explain why. Whitehall needs to get a grip on these absences." The PM has written to Whitehall staff saying: "We need fewer civil servants." But Mike Clancy, of union Prospect, said: "Civil servants went above and beyond to pull the country through the pandemic and Brexit. These massive cuts will do immeasurable damage to the public services we rely on." The Government said: "The number of working days lost to sickness declined over the past year. In 2021 we introduced a temporary easing of sick pay regulations, which was the right thing to do." 5,706 days off taken by health department staff without sick notes 10,000 working days lost from staff absences in three years.
