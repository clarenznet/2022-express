  Helena was filming in Manchester today when some candid snaps were taken of her dressed up in character. Her bright red curls almost matched the orange car she was seen emerging from. The actress wore a patterned turquoise and orange shirt, a tan overcoat and a pair of shades in some of the pictures. In others, she could be seen wearing a bright, multi-coloured robe. Noele, who died at the age of 65 in 1985, played the iconic Meg Mortimer in the long-running British soap opera Crossroads from 1964 to 1981.
