Castell Gyrn has six bedrooms, a tower, 47 acres with views and parking for several vehicles, or trusty steeds. But the detached stronghold was snapped up for £1,750,000 – less than half its original £3.9million price tag. Despite its stone-lined interiors and suits of armour, the castle in Ruthin, North Wales, is not as old as it looks. It was built in stages from 1977 to 1994. Potential owners included former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, who viewed it twice in 2016. But now somebody will be king of the castle. Helen Jude, of Landwood Group, said: “We’re delighted to have secured a buyer for this truly unique property.”
