Russian President Putin has been typically authoritarian since he sent his troops into Ukraine earlier this year. State media in Russia is obediently toeing the line, denying that the country is at war and branding the invasion a "special military operation." However, it appears Putin could be facing some resistance. Ukraine's head of military intelligence, Major General Kyrylo Budanov, insisted earlier this month Ukraine will defeat Russia, adding that a coup to remove Putin is already under way. He told Sky News: "It will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched and they are moving into that way." Asked if a coup has already started he replied: "Yes. They are moving in this way and it is impossible to stop it." The General claimed that Putin has cancer saying he is in a “very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick”. Of the Russian invasion, he claimed: “The breaking point will be in the second part of August. “Most of the active combat will have finished by the end of the year. It will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched. “As a result we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories.” This week, another indication Putin could be facing increasing opposition in Moscow emerged - as it is claimed two Russian colonels have been recorded insulting the despot. The Ukrainian intelligence services claim they have a recording of the colonels taking aim at their leader. As quoted by the Daily Beast, one said: “A f***ing rocket should fly into (Ukraine’s Parliament) in Kyiv. That’s it f*** it. Why didn’t (a rocket) f***ing fly? I don’t f***ing get it, you’re f***ed, Putin motherf*****. “Why didn’t a rocket fly into Kyiv…. Something hasn’t been done the right way.” The alleged call was broadcast by Radio Free Europe’s Ukrainian service and is believed to have taken place on April 14. The two military men also attacked the Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu who one labelled “incompetent” and said their army made “horrible losses”. In the recorded message, the pair were heard agreeing that the war is being led by “bootlickers” and criticised the poor salaries of the soldiers.

It has been reported in the last week that Russia is making progress in the east of Ukraine. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, in its latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine, says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. "Over May 30-31, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. "Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.” NATO and the US have said the war in Ukraine is likely to end at the negotiating table.

Mr Stoltenberg said: “Wars are unpredictable. We were able to predict the invasion, but how this war will evolve, it’s very hard to predict. What we do know is that almost all wars end at some stage at the negotiating table.” Mr Blinken also said: “What we’re working to do … is to make sure that the Ukrainians have in hand what they need to defend against this aggression, to repel it and push it back. "And as well, and as a result, to make sure that they have the strongest possible hand at any negotiating table that emerges.”
