A Whitehall worker told Express.co.uk: “We’re trapped in the office. Not allowed out." A MyLondon journalist reported that two other parliamentary staffers “[told] me they haven’t been informed of anything”. Josiah Mortimer later added in a post on Twitter that “several Whitehall departments are locked down and staff are being kept away from windows”. James Heale of the Spectator also reported that parliamentary staff had been “evacuated out of offices” to ensure their safety. A spokesperson said: “Police were called at 11:27am on Tuesday, June 7, to reports of a suspicious package found in Parliament Street. “Officers are on scene and safety cordons and closures are in place while enquiries are undertaken.” Just over an hour later, the Met announced that the cordons had been lifted as the package was found to have been “non suspicious”.
