Amanda Holden, 51, perched on a balcony overlooking the London Eye and the city skyline as she showcased her flawless and age-defying physique. The BGT judge looked cool, calm and confident as she rocked the two-piece by up to the minute fashion brand Forever Unique. It consisted of a pair of wide leg trousers and a matching cropped blazer, revealing her bare and totally toned waist in between. Alongside these glammed-up photos, Amanda also flashed her legs in another chic white outfit when she accompanied her daughter Lexi, 16, to Wimbledon yesterday afternoon as first round matches kicked off. Lexi, who is planning a fashion career after leaving school, proudly posed alongside her in a dazzling green outfit, leading onlookers to exclaim that she and youthful Amanda looked more like sisters than mother and daughter.
