Tess Daly, 53, has taken to Instagram with stunning shots alongside her husband Vernon Kay, 48. The two can be seen holidaying together as the model shows off her new brand, Naia Beach’s clothing. The television presenter showed off four snaps of herself in various outfits. She can be seen in the first wearing a linen blue dress and square shades as she strolled on the sand. In another shot, she is standing alongside husband Vernon as he is dressed in a white shirt with matching shorts and shoes, with red shades. Meanwhile, she opted for a silk pink gown, baring her shoulder and golden hoops to match. Tess also wore a light tiger design robe and an opaque, light blue gown to match her swimsuit.
