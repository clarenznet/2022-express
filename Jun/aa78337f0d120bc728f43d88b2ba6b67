The Royal College of Nursing has urged the Government to boost funding for treatments and research into the debilitating condition. It says that while some clinics treat Long Covid as a physical problem, the majority see it as psychological.  Existing services are woefully inadequate to meet demand, the RCN claims, with two million people thought to be suffering selfreported long Covid. RCN public health lead Helen Donovan said nurses' skills at managing long-term conditions are "not being used effectively". She added: "Ministers must significantly increase investment and ensure there are enough services and they are consistent across the UK."
