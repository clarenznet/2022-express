Kate Beckinsale, 48, stunned as she showed off her glamorous outfit on Instagram last night. However, the actress had to issue an apology due to a rather eye-popping feature. Kate stunned in a black strapless mini dress, featuring silver diamond circle detailing. The dress also featured a low neckline, exposing the actress's ample assets. She partnered the dress with sky-high black heels and a dramatic headpiece. Kate wore her hair slicked back in a long ponytail, while accessorising with a halo-style spiked headpiece, leaving those walking near her at the chance of being hit by it. In view of her 5.4 million Instagram followers, she warned: "Also very sorry to everyone whose eye I nearly poked out or hair I became momentarily attached to last night." The actress was at Sean Diddy Combs' BET Lifetime Achievement After Party in Los Angeles.
