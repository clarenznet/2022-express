Good Morning Britain presenter Charlotte Hawkins stunned in blue as she was pictured on the first day of Royal Ascot. The annual royal meeting kicked off today and the ITV favourite ensured she put on her best attire for the big event. The broadcaster exuded elegance in a pale blue mid-length dress that featured sheer arms. She teamed the look with a white belt and added a pair of strappy heels. The presenter stuck to Royal Ascot tradition by sporting a fabulous blue headpiece.
