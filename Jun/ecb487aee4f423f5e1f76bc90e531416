On Thursday, the European Parliament Plenary meeting is expected to vote for the International Procurement Instrument (IPI), which will limit non-EU countries' access to the EU public procurement market if their governments do not offer EU companies similar access to public tenders. France has been in favour of the measure since it was introduced by the EU Commission 10 years ago, however, it has been blocked repeatedly by the UK and the Baltics. Now, with the UK no longer in the bloc, it is expected that the legislation will be passed. French trade minister Franck Riester has argued that other countries will open up their procurement to avoid being locked out of the EU. He added that the former one-way openness was an example of how "naive" Brussels had been. According to one diplomat, Brexit has left countries in favour of open trade leaderless. They said: “The French propose things and the Germans go along with it. “The British provided a counterweight before.”
