The actress and singer, 52, was overcome after receiving the Generation Award. During her speech in Santa Monica, California, J.Lo gushed: “I want to thank the people who gave me joy and the ones who broke my heart. The ones who were true, and the ones who lied to me.” Daniel Radcliffe was named best villain for his role in The Lost City. The Harry Potter star, 32, accepted his award virtually, jokingly thanking his parents for having “the foresight all those years ago” to make him English so he could develop a “naturally evil” accent.
