Plans will be set out today with the Prime Minister claiming they are "a blueprint for how we will back farmers, boost British industry and help protect people against the impacts of economic shocks by safeguarding our food security". He added: "Harnessing new technologies and innovation, we will grow and eat more of our own food, unlocking jobs and growing the economy. "This will in turn help to reduce pressure on prices." Russia's war in Ukraine has shocked the global economy, impacted food supplies and caused a surge in prices. The Government thinks its policy will strengthen the resilience of the UK's supply chains. It will boost domestic production to protect against future crises. But reports suggest this will mean scaling back plans for rewilding, which some farmers opposed as it allegedly diverted cash from food production. Ministers last year announced farmers would be paid £800million per year via the Landscape Recovery scheme to alter agricultural land into woodlands, wetlands and forests. But the fund has been cut to £50million over three years, with the latest proposals putting the emphasis back on food. Environment Secretary George Eustice claimed the new strategy "will increase the focus on skills in the food sector, and the roles and career pathways available".
