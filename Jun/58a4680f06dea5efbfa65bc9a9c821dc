The Most Rev Justin Welby also suggested only those with perfect families could judge the rift between Princes Harry and William. He told ITV News presenter Tom Bradby: "I think we have become a very, very unforgiving society... Now with Prince Andrew, I think we all have to step back a bit. "He's seeking to make amends and I think that's a very good thing." Earlier this year Andrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement to Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she was forced to sleep with him when she was 17. He was stripped of his military roles and royal patronages. ** Pick up your historic collector's edition OK!

Mr Welby said: "At a big public occasion the Queen is fully entitled to have one of her children supporting her." Asked about the rift between Harry and William, he said: "Of course it's sad when families are struggling, but what family isn't? "Jesus says, anyone who's never sinned cast the first stone and they all go away... If there's any family where the relationships are perfect, they're entitled to judge, but I'm not going to." He previously announced he would miss the service of thanksgiving for the Queen's reign on Friday after catching Covid.
