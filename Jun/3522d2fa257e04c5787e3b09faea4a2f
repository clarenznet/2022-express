The US President praised Switzerland instead of Sweden for being accepted into the alliance alongside Finland. Blaming the mistake on nerves, Mr Biden joked: "My goodness, I'm getting really anxious here about expanding NATO." He then went on to describe the two Nordic countries joining NATO as a "historic act". He said: "I think we can all agree that this has been a historic NATO Summit." "This summit was about strengthening our alliances, meeting the challenges of our world as it is a day, and the threats we're going to face in the future." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
