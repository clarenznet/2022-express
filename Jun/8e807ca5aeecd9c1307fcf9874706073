Victoria Beckham, 47, treated her Instagram fans to a glimpse of what appeared to be domestic bliss as she filmed husband David Beckham hard at work in the kitchen. "I love you!" she gushed and inserted a cartoon version of her face accompanied by love-heart emojis. Pampered Victoria looked on as David prepared a seafood meal paired with a healthy salad, and approvingly declared: "Very nice!" The ex-Spice Girl turned fashion designer also took the opportunity to model a Victoria Beckham Pride tracksuit from her new collection, praising its cosy fit and rainbow detailing. However, her 30.1 million viewers couldn't get enough of tattooed David's portrayal as the model husband, as the romantic meal scenario unfolded.
