Pussycat Dolls member Kimberly Wyatt, 40, wowed as she attended the Grand Prix Ball in a show-stopping gown. The singer took the red carpet alongside her husband actor Max Rogers, 39, who looked dapper in a black suit and bow tie ensemble. Kimberly opted for a low-cut fishtail gown that featured ripple patterns in champagne. The dress incorporated frill details and matched Kimberly's white strappy stilettos.
