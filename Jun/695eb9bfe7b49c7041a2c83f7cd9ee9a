Gemma Collins, 41, did not fail to entertain her guests as she hosted a Platinum Jubilee party in her sprawling garden. The Only Way Is Essex star took to Instagram to share the hilarious moment she took a tumble as she was about to take to the stage. In a video posted in view of her 2.2 million followers, Gemma could be seen holding a microphone as she made her entrance in a fabulous fringed mini-dress. But Gemma’s special moment took a sudden turn as she slipped and fell while stepping onto the heavily-decorated stage. The TV star captioned the clip: “True GC style yesterday.” While some of the party’s attendees could be heard gasping in the background, Gemma’s Instagram fans and friends could not help but poke fun at the situation in the post’s comments section.
