Kate Bush, 63, is the talk of the music industry at the moment due to hitting the No.1 spot in the UK charts last week with 1985's Running Up That Hill. Netflix's Stranger Things featured the song prominently in season 4, leaving Kate to break her many years of silence and respond to the song's growing popularity on BBC's Radio 4. However, prior to the song's resurgence, Kate had become a "recluse" with her last public appearance dating back to 2014. Kate last performed Running Up That Hill during Before The Dawn, her 2014 theatrical concert series. She was last pictured in public when she attended the Evening Standard's 60th Theatre Awards, where she was presented the Editors Award for Before The Dawn. The singer was pictured with actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Sir Ian McKellan and Rob Brydon.
