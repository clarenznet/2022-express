Natalie Nuttall says she regularly topped up her three children with the coloured factor 50 Protect Kids sun cream. But at the end of their first day in Tenerife, Natalie's 10-year-old daughter Rhia had burnt her shoulders and back, while her three-year-old son Jaxon had burnt his legs. Manchester Evening News reports that Natalie, from Atherton, Wigan, wrote on Facebook: "Just seen a post about this.. I used this on our first day on holiday this week .. it stained my hands pink and burnt my kids .. little girls shoulders and my little boys legs .. I kept them topped up all day in cream we had to go buy more as this did not protect them.. wouldn't recommend this cream at all."  The 31-year-old told the Manchester Evening News: "It didn't stain the kids, but by the time I had done all three kids, it wouldn't wash off my hands it had stained me. "Being pink isn't great either as you can't see if you missed any of the body. I went and bought more cream that day as I didn't trust it to be pink, but she already burnt by the afternoon."  After contacting Asda she has been asked to return the product to store so the product can be investigated. An Asda spokesman said: "All of our UV blocking sunscreens undergo dermatological testing and we have asked the customer to return the bottle they bought so that we can carry out tests to ensure there are no problems with this bottle. "We are pleased that this customer has confirmed her children are doing well and we would like to reassure all of our customers that we haven’t received any other complaints of this nature.’’
