Max Verstappen held off the advances of Carlos Sainz to claim yet another impressive victory at the first Canadian Grand Prix since 2019. The lead changed hands between the two drivers on a number of occasions but the Dutchman managed to keep his Spanish rival at arm's length to stretch his advantage over Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc at the top of the Drivers' Championship standings. Sainz threw everything at Verstappen during the latter stages of the contest after a late safety car gave him the opportunity to challenge the Red Bull man, but was unable to wrestle his way ahead. He was ultimately forced to settle for a second-placed finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton, who drove a near-perfect race to rubber-stamp an impressive podium finish after a disappointing campaign thus far. George Russell managed to cross the line in fourth to wrap up a productive weekend for Mercedes, who have often struggled to keep up with Ferrari and Red Bull for the vast majority of the season to date. Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, was able to secure a fifth-placed finish after starting from 19th on the grid ahead of Esteban Ocon, Fernando Alonso and Valtteri Bottas in sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.
