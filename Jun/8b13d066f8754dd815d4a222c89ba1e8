Holly Willoughby, 41, nailed a summery look with a patterned midi dress, beaming alongside 60-year-old Phillip for a snap as they arrived atÂ All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. The presenter's sleeveless dress was white with a pink pattern detail, featuring a cinched waist, centre zip and wide-collared neckline. She paired the bright look with nude open-toed heels, adding a matching canvas bag with a brown leather panel. Shielding her eyes with dark sunglasses, Holly opted for a radiant, pink-toned palette of makeup. Phillip looked equally as chic as he donned a pair of black trousers with a navy shirt and tailored blazer.
