This is a great opportunity for the UK Government to make plain that from now on it will allow no interference with its own justice system. Removing the UK from the auspices of the ECHR does not imply that Britons will suddenly become authoritarian or fascist, with secret police and torture chambers in every town. It would mean, simply, that we will make our own decisions. Modern history shows that Britain has always been at the forefront of compassion and common sense. The only winners in this endless immigration farce appear to be the human rights lawyers, says Dave Austin, from Chalfont St Peter, Bucks. They not only exploit the illegal migrants but defy and overturn the will of Parliament and the people. Their manipulation of the laws, courts and the woke judges are costing the country millions. Surely the tax burden these lefty lawyers are inflicting on the public should be offset by a windfall tax on all the firms involved in this. I think it is time we gave Sturgeon her vote, and hope she wins, says Graham Partington, from Liverpool. If she wins, Scotland will be bankrupt within six months and the SNP will destroy their country and will never hold office again. How right Alastair Stewart is about some journalists and news presenters, says Linda Talbot, from Stanley, Durham. Robert Peston comes across as arrogant and Tom Bradby is no better. I hate watching the news on any TV channel, I now prefer to get it from my newspaper. Pharmacists are to make referrals for suspected cancer. Perhaps it's time for hospitals to deal with those made by GPs, says Dr Peter Outen (retd), from Brentwood, Essex. Ex-colleagues tell me of the frustration of referrals being blocked by a hospital triage nurse who decides investigations are not required. The GP is not informed and only discovers the truth when the patients, after being told by the nurse to ignore their symptoms, present again with advanced cancer.
