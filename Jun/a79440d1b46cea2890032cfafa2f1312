The summer transfer window officially opened on Friday and there's already plenty going on. Tottenham having already confirmed two signings in Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster while Liverpool and Manchester City have deals to announce, the Reds having snapped up Fabio Carvalho and City with Erling Haaland. But those three clubs are on the hunt for more additions with Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal among the many other sides also seeking to strengthen ahead of the new campaign. Liverpool have made great progress this week in their bid to sign Darwin Nunez from Benfica as they look to beat fierce competition to land the striker. Man Utd were another club linked with the free-scoring Uruguayan, who looks set to cost Liverpool a package that could reach a club-record fee surpassing their current £75million benchmark. The Red Devils are currently preoccupied trying to bring in Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. The Dutchman is new manager Erik ten Hag's top target and a deal looks feasible given Barca's desperate need for a cash influx. United may have to splash out as much as £70m to get the deal done. Elsewhere, Chelsea and Tottenham continue in their attempts to strengthen in defence. Jules Kounde tops the list for the Blues while Spurs have a number of alternatives to Alessandro Bastoni who has snubbed a move to north London. Elsewhere in the north of the capital, Arsenal want a midfielder with Youri Tielemans a prominent option, and further north than that, Haaland will soon be announced as a Man City player but the Citizens could lose Bernardo Silva to Barca.
