Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman's new Channel 4 show One Question launched on Friday, and sees pairs of contestants answering just one answer correctly to win £100,000. Each comes with 20 possible answers and the players must decide between themselves what the ultimate answer is. However, a number of viewers weren't impressed with the new programme, and quickly took to social media to express their disappointment. The first episode saw two pairs taking on the challenge. Sadly, the first contestants found themselves out of the show when they answered a question incorrectly. The next pair managed to get to the end of the round and secure the £100,000. Although the show wasn't short of drama, it received a lot of criticism from those tuned in to watch.

Others couldn't help but notice the game had a similar feel to another quiz show. "#OneQuestion taking inspiration from Jeopardy with their question format. Claudia Winkleman though lifting it beyond the average quiz show already. Can't believe this is her first game show since Talking Telephone Numbers in the 90," penned @Brekkietweets. @JRsArmchair fumed: "A Poundland version of Jeopardy.. #OneQuestion." (sic) Several disagreed though, with many praising the new Friday night show. DON'T MISS...

"It’s alright, and has youth appeal, but I don’t think it’ll be enough for Series 2." Talking to Alex Jones on Thursday's The One Show, Claudia talked about the premise of the show. She explained: "I thought the idea was so brilliant. "Because normally with quizzes if you choose option B, then you stand on the red square, and then you can only answer from D, E... "And I'm like... 'Oh, I don't understand' because I'm thick. "But this - I loved it, it's just one question and not only that, we can give you the answers!" One Question continues on Friday at 8pm on Channel 4.
