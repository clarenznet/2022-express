Rafael Nadal has admitted that his foot was "asleep" during the French Open final after taking several injections throughout the tournament. Nadal came through a testing challenge at Roland Garros this week, which included a tremendous win over Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals.  The world No 5 was then given a pass through to the final after Alexander Zverev was forced to withdraw from their semi-final after a horrific ankle injury. Nadal has been playing with an injury of his own in his foot throughout the tournament. But he showed no signs of that hampering his talent on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Casper Ruud. The 36-year-old barely needed to step out of first gear to take control against Ruud from the opening set. The Norwegian struggled to trouble Nadal with the Spaniard showing exactly why he's regarded as the 'king of clay'. And it took Nadal just under two-and-a-half hours to secure his 14th French Open title in the end.

Even more impressive was the fact that Nadal was able to come through the gruelling two-week schedule and end up with his 22nd major trophy. And Nadal has now opened up on just how much he had to do behind the scenes to get his body in a position where he was able to compete. DON'T MISS  "Everybody knows in the world of tennis that the preparation was not ideal," he told Eurosport. "I have been outside of the practice courts for one month and a half with a stress fracture on the rib. "And then I have the foot that is something that stays there all the time. In Rome it was very difficult. But I've had my doctor here with me and we played with no feeling in the foot. "We played with an injection in the nerve so that the foot was asleep so thats why I was able to play."
