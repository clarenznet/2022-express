For Nicole Carpenter, 23, scaling the huge landmark was a romantic moment to cherish - as she said "yes" to Matt Underwood, 24, on the circular deck of Brighton's British Airways i360 tower. Nicole said she felt "on top of the world" after her partner of three-and-a-half years got down on one knee, inside what has been billed as the world's first vertical cable car. Our reporter witnessed the tender scene, before making some adrenalin-fueled memories of his own. For the new Walk 360 experience, he was clipped securely to a steel rail and walked the tower's circumference, guided by an instructor. Russell said: "I did my best to pretend I wasn't petrified. "Even the seagulls didn't seem to venture that high. "I inched towards the edge, thinking: 'Why on earth am I standing on top of this glass observation pod and not inside it, enjoying a glass of wine?'" The i360 offers even more white-knuckle options - as you can drop down on a rope from the platform, or climb up onto the 531ft-high roof of the tower using ladders in a central shaft, which is just four metres wide. When it opened in 2016, the beachside attraction entered the Guinness Book of Records as "the world's most slender tower" - and its breathtaking views of the South Downs and the Channel, over to the Isle of Wight, have since wowed hundreds of thousands of visitors. The i360 is meeting demand from holidaymakers for bigger, scarier thrills. Even Blackpool Pleasure Beach has upgraded. The Lancashire site already had the only UK double-launch roller coaster, Icon, which delivers the same rate of acceleration as a Formula One car. Now its last three rows of seats have been adapted so riders can spin and twist freely as their faces ripple under gravitational forces of up to 4G. But it may not be the best place to pop the question.
