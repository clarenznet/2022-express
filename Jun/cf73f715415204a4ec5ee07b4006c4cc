Manchester United are continuing to work on transfer business for this summer. Erik ten Hag remains keen on Frenkie de Jong, despite Barcelona demanding huge money in order to part ways with their prized asset. And the likes of Christian Eriksen, Jurrien Timber, Pau Torres, Ruben Neves, Antony and Christopher Nkunku all remain linked as well. It's been a slow start to the summer from Manchester United, despite the Red Devils losing the likes of Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Lee Grant and Edinson Cavani on free transfers. Arsenal have already moved for Marquinhos and Fabio Vieira in comparison, while Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool have also strengthened their respective squads. United are hoping to get a deal for De Jong over the line, with the Netherlands international still their top transfer target despite Barcelona making it clear they will only let him go providing an offer in the region of Â£73million is presented. Eriksen is also on their radar, while there's been a new twist with Timber today. Stay tuned for all the latest updates as Express Sport keeps you posted throughout the day.
