Following its classic "festival" theme, this weekend’s summer airshow at the Imperial War Museum Duxford promises a wide variety of aircraft types from the UK and overseas to exhibit a spectacular family-friendly show. From crowd favourites, the Red Arrows, to World War II’s Spitfires and Hurricanes, onlookers can expect to see a vast array of iconic jets, but what’s the full line-up? Taking place from around 1.30pm to 5.30pm on both Saturday and Sunday, the much-anticipated summer airshow promises a remarkable weekend of aerial shows and fast-flying action, as well as a broad range of on-the-ground entertainment. IWM Air Show event manager Phil Hood said: “The first air show of the season is always hotly anticipated and we can’t wait to deliver a fantastic weekend of entertainment over what looks to be a warm and sunny couple of days. “As always, there will be plenty of aerial displays and fast-flying action in the skies from the likes of the Wing Walking team, the RAF Falcons parachutists, the official helicopter display team of the Royal Navy and a flypast from the Red Arrows on the Saturday. “Entertainment on the ground will offer something for everyone with live music, a traditional steam fair, living history groups and fantastic vehicle displays and, of course, IWM Duxford’s fascinating exhibitions and hangars.”  READ MORE: Polar air set to chill boiling Britain as heatwave FINALLY ends  From shows to celebrate Britain’s incredible fleet of aircraft to shows paying homage to Duxford’s role in World War II, here is the full list of planes you should expect to see over the course of the weekend:   The flying times for the show over the weekend are as follows: 1.15pm - The Falcons RAF Falcons Parachute Display Team1.32pm - Muscle Pitts Pitts S-2S1.46pm - Gyro Air Displays Calidus Autogyro2pm - Royal Air Force Tutor Display Team Grob Tutor T12.10pm - Strikemaster Display UK 2 x BAC Strikemaster2.24pm - Bremont Great War Display Team 7 x First World War replicas2.45pm - Catalina Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina2.59pm - Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster B13.09pm - The Red Arrows 7 x BAe Systems Hawk T1 DON'T MISS: Flood warnings in place as heavy rains and storms batter the country [INSIGHT]How to make 'cheap and effective' weed killer [EXPLAINED]Have Your Say: What do you want to see Boris do to make Brexit work? [HAVE YOUR SAY]   3.14pm - Team Raven 6 x Vans RV-83.42pm - Norwegian Air Force Historical Squadron MiG-15UTI/Vampire FB.523.54pm - US Fighters P-47D Thunderbolt/TF-51D Mustang4.04pm - The Black Cats Wildcat HMA24.15pm - AeroSuperBatics Wing Walkers 2 x Boeing PT-17 Stearman4.32pm - Stichting Fokker Four 4 x Fokker S-114.49pm - B-17 Sally B Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress4.57pm - The Blades 4 x Extra EA-3005.22pm - Spitfire Supermarine Spitfire Mk Ia 1.15pm - The Falcons RAF Falcons Parachute Display Team1.32pm - AeroSuperBatics Wing Walkers 2 x Boeing PT-17 Stearman1.51pm - Gyro Air Displays Calidus Autogyro2.05pm - The Black Cats Wildcat HMA22.14pm - Strikemaster Display UK 2 x BAC Strikemasters  2.28pm - Bremont Great War Display Team 7 x First World War replicas2.49pm - Catalina Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina3.03pm - Team Raven 6 x Vans RV-83.27pm - Royal Air Force Tutor Display Team Grob Tutor T13.42pm - Norwegian Air Force Historical Squadron MiG-15UTI/Vampire FB.523.54pm - US Fighters P-47D Thunderbolt/TF-51D Mustang4.04pm - Harvards 2 x North American T-64.16pm - Muscle Pitts Pitts S-2S4.28pm - Stichting Fokker Four 4 x Fokker S-114.47pm - B-17 Sally B Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress4.55pm - The Blades 4 x Extra EA-3005.22pm - Spitfire Supermarine Spitfire Mk Ia Tickets for Saturday, June 18 are no longer available however, there is still time to grab some for Sunday’s show.
