Sir Rod Stewart, 77, launched a blistering counterattack after Elvis Costello, 67, made several negative comments about his rendition of Sweet Caroline at the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. During a gig in Glasgow last week, Elvis branded the Party at the Palace “sh**e” and quipped that Rod was having a “bad night vocally”. On Sunday evening, the Maggie May singer took to Twitter to savage Elvis in view of his 481,000 followers.He remarked: “Dear Elvis @elviscostello.“Yes, my voice was rough [because] of Covid. I apologise.“I thought it better it to make an appearance rather than let everyone down, so sorry.
