Been thinking of taking the plunge and switching to Sky Glass? Now is a very good time to sign up for this smart telly as you'll be able to take advantage of one of the best Sky TV deals we've come across – with anyone who buys Sky Glass today getting a £100 reward. This cashback comes via a pre-paid Mastercard meaning you can spend the money anywhere that accepts this popular plastic. If that sounds tempting there's not long left to take advantage of this offer with it running out at midnight tonight, June 23. If you're unfamiliar with the latest hardware from Sky, find out everything you need to know in our in-depth Sky Glass review. Prices for this clever TV start from just £13 per month for the 43-inch model with the 55-inch version costing £17 and the 65-inch starting from £21 per month. Once you've ordered the telly it's then up to you what channels you want to add with extra services such as Sky Sports and Sky Cinema increasing the monthly bill. For example, add Sky Entertainment with Netflix and you'll pay £26 more. Pop Sky Sports on the big screen and that will add £25 to the monthly outgoings with Sky Cinema costing another £11. As a quick reminder, Sky Glass is the first product from the firm that doesn't need a dish for it to work. Everything you watch is beamed to the screen via a standard broadband connection making this device easy to install and move around your home. Unlike Sky Q, there's also no hard disk tucked inside the telly with shows and movies available via a Playlist function which uses catch-up services to broadcast any shows you may have missed. Other features exclusive to Sky Glass include a colour-matched remote control that gets backlit keys and the telly comes with its own soundbar built-in. That means you get booming audio without having to spend any extra money. Sky has also made it much more simple to stream content from other platforms with easy access to services such Disney+, Netflix and Apple TV+.
