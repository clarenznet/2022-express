Aldi is known for its Specialbuys and its shoppers are always obsessed with its products. Just in time for Platinum Jubilee happening this weekend, Aldi is slashing prices one of its most beloved outdoor essentials that's ideal for BBQs and garden parties. With prices slashed by 20 percent off, Aldi is offering customers discounts on the ultimate outdoor essential for garden parties and gatherings. Just in time for Jubilee weekend, stay dry and cool from rainy weather with the Gardenline Decorative Gazebo. Available for less than £100, avoid bad weather with this gazebo which has plenty of room to keep you and your guests covered. It’s great over garden tables or even a hot tub and is made from durable materials to last through all weather. The gazebo has got decorative side panels and its steel frame makes sure it doesn’t blow away from the wind. The British weather is set to be rainy and sunny during the weekend, so it’s a smart purchase to avoid any unwanted party mishaps. It’s now available on Aldi for £99.99 here. Reviews love the design of it and shoppers were extremely pleased Aldi restocked the popular Specialbuy. Ness from Gloucestershire wrote: “Lovely gazebo! Really pleased with it and managed to put it up alone.” Joanne also added: “At first I wasn’t impressed as the water started to pool on the material but then I realised you can pull the corner bars out more to pull material tighter and now it is fabulous.” Plus, Aldi also has several other gazebos available online and recently added the Adventuridge Backpack Gazebo. Perfect for smaller spaces and easy to transport around, it provides shade from the sun and rain with its simple, but effective design. The Backpack Gazebo is available here for £44.99.
