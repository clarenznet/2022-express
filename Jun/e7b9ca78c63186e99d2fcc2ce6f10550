Gala magazine ran an article with the headline: "Tyrannical Meghan Markle? These overwhelming discoveries that will never be revealed." It comes after reports that the findings of an investigation into allegations the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, which she denies, will never be published. According to the Sunday Times, Buckingham Palace no longer plans to make a public statement on the inquiry. However, changes to the Royal Household's HR policies as a result of the probe are expected to be published in the annual Sovereign Grant report. The move is reportedly aimed at limiting tensions between the Sussexes and the royals. Meghan's lawyers previously branded bullying allegations, first reported in March 2021, as a “calculated smear campaign” before her and Prince Harry's Oprah Winfrey interview.
