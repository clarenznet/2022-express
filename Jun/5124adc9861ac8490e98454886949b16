Pitstop Truckstop in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, has become the latest small business to fall victim to the UK's staff shortage crisis. Donal Dickson, who has the run the eatery for the past nine years, stressed he "really tried" to find new employees but that he agreed with recent resrach that found fewer people are arriving in the UK following Brexit. Mr Dickson, who now works at a petrol garage, said: "I just can't get any staff so I had to close it in the end. If I want to run a proper business, I need to have enough staff. "It's too difficult to find anyone at the moment. I have really tried, but you just can't get the employees." It in its heyday, the café just off the M5 was open from 5.30am until 10pm, serving fry-ups and other hearty snacks, reports Birmingham Live. The building is now deserted and gathering dust.  Industries from childcare and hospitality to the NHS, airports and airlines have struggled to recruit new staff in recent months. The National Day Nurseries Association has warned nurseries are being forced to close or reduce their childcare due to staff recruitment issues. There are more job vacancies than unemployed people across the UK for the first time ever, latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed today. While the unemployment rate among people aged 16 and over for January to March fell to 3.7 percent, or around 1.26 million. Data suggests the number of vacancies rose slightly to 1.29 million. Various reasons given for staff shortages include that there are large numbers of people aged over 50 deciding to no longer work; young people are studying for longer and fewer people are arriving in the UK following Brexit.
