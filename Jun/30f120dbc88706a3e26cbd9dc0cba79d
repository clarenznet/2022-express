The European Commission caused anger as it started action in retaliation for the Government's move to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It is also resuming proceedings against the UK that were shelved to ease talks on post-Brexit trade. But Downing Street hit back, saying the PM was "disappointed" by the EU's move. The Government has two months to respond before the case goes to the European Court of Justice. Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic told Mr Johnson the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, tabled on Monday, had "no legal or political justification", adding: "This is illegal. It has created deep uncertainty and casts a shadow over our overall co-operation, all at a time when respect for international agreements has never been more important." The Prime Minister's spokesman said Brussels' plans for resolving the issue would lead to more checks and make the situation worse: "We will consider these documents carefully and respond formally in due course. "However we are disappointed the EU has taken this legal action." "The EU's proposed approach, which doesn't differ from what they have said previously, would increase burdens on business and citizens." "It is difficult to see how scrapping grace periods and adding additional controls and checks would make the situation better." The Bill aims to drop parts of the Protocol including a check-free "green channel" for goods from mainland Britain and stripping control from the EU court. It also would ensure VAT changes apply to Northern Ireland and permit state subsidies. Ex-Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood said the EU had undermined the Good Friday Agreement: "They are the lawbreakers, not the UK." Meanwhile, Labour has denied it would rejoin the single market after recent comments made by its frontbencher Anna McMorrin.
