Speaking for the first time since Wakefield was lost to Labour and Tiverton and Honiton was lost to the Liberal Democrats, Mr Johnson said: "It's absolutely true we've had some tough by-election results, they've been I think a reflection of a lot of things but we've got to recognise voters are going through a tough time at the moment. I think as a government I've got to listen to what people are saying, in particular to the difficulties people are facing over the cost of living, which I think for most people is the number one issue. We're now facing pressures on the cost of living, we're seeing spikes in fuel prices, energy costs, food costs - that's hitting people. We've got to recognise there is more we've got to do and we certainly will, we will keep going, addressing the concerns of people until we get through this patch." His comments come after the resignation of Tory party co-chairman Oliver Dowden, who said someone must "take responsibility" for the party's decline. Meanwhile, Gavin Barwell, former Downing Street chief of staff under Theresas May, described the Tiverton and Honiton result as "catastrophic". FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
