Andy Murray has beaten Nick Kyrgios 7-6, 6-2 in the semi-finals of the Stuttgart Open to set up a clash with Matteo Berrettini in the final. The match was Murray's first tour-level semi-final since 2016 at Wimbledon, where he beat Tomas Berdych in straight sets before defeating Milos Raonic to win his last Grand Slam singles title. Since then, Murray's career has been beset by injury problems, with the former world number one forced to undergo two hip surgeries in 2018 and 2019.

Murray was in vintage form against Tsitsipas and continued to show his quality against Kyrgios. In a very close first set, Murray led throughout before winning a tiebreak to go 7-6 up in the match. Following the Scotsman's triumph in the tiebreak, Kyrgios smashed his racket on the floor and was handed a penalty point, before getting a game penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.
