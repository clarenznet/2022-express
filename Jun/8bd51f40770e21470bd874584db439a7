Durham Police are investigating whether they broke Covid rules. A party spokesman confirmed they had returned their questions. Sir Keir had been seen drinking a beer in an MP’s office in Durham in April 2021 but denied that it flouted any rules. At the time of the Beergate event, non-essential retail and outdoor venues such as pub gardens were open, but a ban on any indoor mixing of households was still in place. Labour has argued that food was consumed between work activities on the evening in question, meaning it was within the rules. Last month, Durham Police announced they had reversed their earlier decision that no offence was committed at the gathering, after receiving “significant new information”.
