Victoria Beckham has showcased her incredible figure ahead of a romantic date night with her husband David Beckham this evening. The mother of four, 48, took to Instagram earlier today to reveal what she was planning to wear on their night out on the town. In view of her 30 million followers, the fashion mogul showcased her date night attire from her own range. Wearing a figure-hugging black dress, Victoria said: "So tonight myself and David are going on a date night and I am wearing another one of my VB Body dresses. "I love this one, I really love the neckline. It's got a little slit, quite high, if you can see it. "It's super flattering, I love how it really holds me in at the waist, really gives me a nice, curved bottom," she said, while doing a little shimmy. "I love this, it's a really good shape on the a** as well," she added. In the next story,Victoria told her beau that she was ready and waiting to be wined and dined. "I'm ready for date night," Victoria said while pouting at the camera and tagging David. She continued to sing her dress's praises in her later stories.
