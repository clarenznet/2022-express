Bottles or sachets of weed killing solution can easily run into double figures, especially if you've got a large area to clear.  But one woman says she's found an incredibly effective answer that costs just £1.18. Sharing her discovery on a money-saving Facebook group, she said she came across the instructions for making your own weed killer at home using just a litre of white vinegar, three large spoons of salt, three large spoons of washing-up liquid and a spray bottle. As, like most people, she already had most of the ingredients as they are common household products, she simply bought two 59p bottles of vinegar from Home Bargains and that was all she needed, the Manchester Evening News reports. "My Mum was talking about the weeds growing up between the slabs on her driveway and path," said the woman. "Couldn't sleep the other night so started googling away. Came across this website detailing how to make your own weed killer at home. Bought the vinegar from Home Bargains (59p for 500ml) and she already had rest of the ingredients needed. "£1.18 was all it cost, and after using it on Sunday she said it's the best weed killer ever! Hope this helps someone out." The good news for anyone wanting to give it a go, is that you can get white vinegar for an even cheaper price. In fact, Aldi sells 568ml bottles for just 32p, while Tesco is even cheaper at 29p. Other gardeners took to Facebook to back the mum's claim that the weed solution works. Graeme Wade said: "After cutting the leaves down, I used similar on ivy roots growing in a stone wall and they didn't return."
