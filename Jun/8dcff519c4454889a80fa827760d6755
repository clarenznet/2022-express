Things are really beginning to heat up in the summer transfer market as the Premier League's elite clubs plot how they will strengthen their squads ahead of the new season. A number of them have already completed big signings, but there are likely to be plenty more where they came from over the coming days and weeks. Liverpool's pursuit of Benfica forward Darwin Nunez has been public knowledge for some time now, and it appears only a matter of time before the Uruguayan's signature is announced - with the rumoured fee of Â£85m set to smash the Reds' record transfer. Manchester United, meanwhile, are yet to make additions to Erik ten Hag's team but have their irons in a number of fires. Inter Milan right-back Denzel Dumfries is the latest big name to be linked, while the likes of Antony, Frenkie de Jong and Richarlison are also being talked about. The London trio of Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham will also no doubt be busy too, and it remains to be see whether there are any major developments with any of them today. And with the likes of Manchester City, Newcastle and Everton also set to splash the cash, things could begin to move very quickly very soon.
