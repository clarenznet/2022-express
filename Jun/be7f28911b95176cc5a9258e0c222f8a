  Margot, 31, looked gorgeous as ever dressed in Barbieâ€™s 1970s style iconic hot pink outfit with flared trousers patterned with stars printed all over. The look was complete with a matching pink scarf and some white, high-heeled boots. However, pictures from the set show the actress was in tears whilst filming a scene. Margot was photographed sitting on some steps looking very upset and crying.
