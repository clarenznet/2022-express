 Neil Jones, 40, has taken to Instagram to unveil a new tattoo to fans. The Strictly star was seen posing in his home as he stood shirtless in front of a mirror.  The star’s tattoos include two black bands around his elbow and one around his bicep with words written in them.  He also has a line-drawing love heart on the right side of his chest and another line drawing of a woman and boy walking.  The top of his arm has a tattoo of part of the world map.  In a post of himself dancing from yesterday, Neil wrote in the caption: “I’m a strong believer that in life everything happens for a reason.  “We are constantly tested to make sure we are on track and focused on what we want in life and what will make us happy.”
