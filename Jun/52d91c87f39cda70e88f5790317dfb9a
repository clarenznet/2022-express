The Transport Secretary joined Jon Kay on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday to discuss the biggest rail walkout in 30 years. Grant Shapps furiously hit out at the RMT as he accused the union of impacting “millions of hard working people” and slamming the Labour Party for having “nothing to say” on the matter. Kay skewered Shapps on RMT union boss Mick Lynch asking the Transport Secretary to join union talks in an interview earlier on in the programme. The BBC Breakfast host said: “We have a Transport Secretary, we have a transport crisis surely there’s a responsibility on you even if you don’t think they’re going to be receptive even if you don’t think it’s going to work surely it’s worth a try.” “It’s a stunt and they’re doing it for effect,” Shapps replied. “They walked out of talks whilst they were still ongoing and went and called a press conference and said it was over.” “Labour who have got nothing to say they won’t even condemn the strike with millions of hard working people unable to get to their jobs,” he continued. “The irony of this strike is the RMT are saying they’re doing this for people who are less well paid. “Actually, generally in the white collar jobs people can sit down at their computer and use Teams and Zoom to contact and stay at work. “But the people they’re hurting are the cleaners, people who have to physically turn up and sometimes less well paid.” “Let’s not forget the public put £16billion into running this railway during coronavirus,” Shapps quipped. “That’s the equivalent of £600 per family and the way we’re all thanked for that is by this militant extreme union taking their workers out on strike on the false pretext that there was not going to be a pay increase and compulsory job cuts both of which are fundamentally untrue.” More to follow…
