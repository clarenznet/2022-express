I think we can all agree that all our lives are the poorer for its sad passing. I mean not poorer in the 8.35 million dollars way that Amber Heard's life is poorer but poorer in a very real way, empty of vicarious celebrity thrills and, let's be honest, bare faced schadenfreude. The emptiness, the vileness and the sheer vacuousness of Depp and Heard's lives have made us all feel so much better about our own.   The grotesque contempt the pair show for each other puts our own little hissies about whose turn it is to do the dishwasher into wonderful, and positively loving, perspective. Indeed I suspect Heard and Depp's multi-million dollar humiliation-fest in Fairfax County Court in little old Virginia has been a huge fillip for mental health across the globe. 'I might be mediocre but at least I'm not Amber Heard', 'my marriage might be in the toilet but it's still not as bad as Johnny and Amber', 'I do enjoy a cheeky morning livener but I'm no Depp', 'I might be miffed with my old man but at least I didn't poo in his bed'. Time after time during the six week hearing Depp and Heard brought a tangible feelgood factor to all our lives, simply by being such terrible people.  Money doesn't buy happiness is of course one of the very many cruel lies fed to poor people, but here, just for once it was true! Loaded and still utterly lunatic! And how we loved them for it. Like the Rooney / Vardy court case, we'd long forgotten what it was all actually about. Indeed, hand on heart, we'd never really known or cared. We just delighted in seeing very rich people - the kind we are constantly told are simply better than us - looking venal, idiotic, grasping and plain old horrible. In a real way it turned out to be true, celebrities really aren't like us. They are way, way worse.
