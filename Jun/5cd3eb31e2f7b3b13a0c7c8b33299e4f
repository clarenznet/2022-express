The unpaid services they offer to charities, schools, activity groups like the Scouts and Girl Guides ­and their families are worth two ­per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. The findings highlight the critical but often overlooked role the over 65s play in society and the economy, says the Centre of Economic and Business Research (CEBR). Its report – commissioned by the Retirement Villages Group – found 8.6 million pensioners volunteering in some capacity in 2020/21 – ­contributing an economic boost of £32.7billion.There are also a million older people acting as informal ­carers to loved ones, whether looking after grandchildren or caring for relatives, which has an economic value of £15.3billion.Pushpin Singh, economist at the CEBR, said: “Retired people ­are often portrayed as adding only limited value to our economy.“This picture is biased and neglects the fact that retired people engage in a range of socially and economically valuable activities.“Activities undergone by over-65s do indeed have significant weight ­to them, dispelling conventional beliefs while reinforcing the invaluable part they play in building the communities we see today.” Psychologist Jo Hemmings said: “When you give up work it can feel like a huge sense of loss but it doesn’t have to be that way. Retirement is an exciting phase of life, but the emotional jolt of leaving work, its routines and friendship circles, can bring with it loneliness and a lack of fulfilment.“Getting involved with your local community is the best way to make sure you have the right ingredients for a content retired life.”The CEBR calculated the total time spent by retirees volunteering in their local communities multiplied by the average wage as per ­the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) for a comparable, paid role, to calculate the economy-wide impact.The services included volunteers working in clubs and organisations, those offering unpaid help to individuals or friends and family.Another way the over-65s “give back” is by serving as councillors on local councils. More than a third (37 per cent) of all local authority councillors in England are aged over 65 contributing £129million worth of time and services.Pensioners are motivated to volunteer by a sense of purpose once they leave the working world, research found. Judyth Allday, 84, has volunteered her time and expertise since she retired as an occupational therapist 20 years ago.The mother-of-two continued to work for free when she moved into Cedars Village, part of the Retirement Villages Group, five years ago. She has spent time at a nearby hospice, where she was a kitchen assistant, and drove around collecting lottery tickets for patients.And the energetic octogenarian also volunteered at the local manor house – where her doll’s house is displayed – serving drinks and helping in the shop.Mrs Allday, from Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, said: “I am someone who likes to give, so to speak, rather than receive.“I volunteer because I want to help out, it’s something that’s in me.” Peter Humphries’ police constable father has inspired his volunteering work.The 92-year-old, below, knows how hard officers have to work and, in an effort to help, he set up a neighbourhood watch programme 20 years ago.He then took over running it when he became a resident at the Castle Village retirement complex in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, seven years ago.Peter informs new residents about the scheme and gives them police welcome packs.The former West End hotel manager organises visits from community police officers.Peter also runs an art group. He said: “The neighbourhood watch is incredibly important and frees up police time for more serious incidents.” Volunteers do so much more than help the country’s purse strings.They play an integral role in society – behind each of those pounds saved is a person helped, a crisis averted, or a community service supported.Particularly generous with their time are those who are retired. Without the distraction of work, many are committed to supporting several causes a week.But volunteers also have much to gain – for their mental, emotional and physical wellbeing and the sense of purpose it brings.It can also be a way to stay physically fit.So I am a huge advocate for volunteering being prescribed by doctors.●If you want to sign up, visit www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk for more information.
