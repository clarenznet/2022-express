In a video shared on Twitter by the BBC's Francis Scarr on Monday, Ramzan Kadyrov claimed that Putin's war was "for good" and a war for the "happiness of the people", according to Mr Scarr's translation. Mr Kadyrov, who has been outspoken about his support for Putin since the war began, went on to say: "If it were up to me, I'd take all those European states, which are now worth absolutely nothing and know their value." He then said that "waging wars is a pleasure" and "we get pleasure from it." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
