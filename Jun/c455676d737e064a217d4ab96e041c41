Jeff Goldblum and his gymnast wife Emilie Livingston put on an affectionate display as they attended the Los Angeles premiere of Jurassic World Dominion in Hollywood yesterday. The Hollywood actor, 69, couldn't keep his hands off his wife of eight years as they took to the red carpet together.  Emilie dazzled in a cream coloured, floor-length gown which featured a cinched-in waistline and high neckline. The gymnast accessorised with a simple gold necklace and an armful of bracelets of the same metal. She wore a pair of pointed-toe black shoes and clasped a black clutch bag to match. Emilie wore her brown tresses in a plaited updo as well as a natural and glowing face of makeup. Meanwhile, her beau Jeff cut a smart figure in a black blazer which complimented his leather shoes. He wore a light blue pair of trousers which he matched to a shirt, which featured a patterned polo-neck top underneath. The couple have been married for eight years having tied the knot in 2014 and share two children together.
