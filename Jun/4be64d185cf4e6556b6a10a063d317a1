Novak Djokovic outclassed Thanasi Kokkinakis on Wednesday afternoon to reach the Wimbledon third round. The Serb looked in imperious form on Centre Court, toppling Nick Kyrgios’ doubles partner in straight sets to keep his incredible unbeaten run at SW19 alive. Djokovic has not been beaten at Wimbledon for almost five years, with his streak partially interrupted by the Covid pandemic. And that run never truly looked under threat on Wednesday, blitzing the first set 6-1 and keeping his foot on the gas despite Kokkinakis growing into the encounter. The Aussie put four games on the board in the second as Djokovic won 6-4, having used a series of drop shots to his advantage. And the top seed saw out the third and final set 6-2 to send Kokkinakis packing and keep his own Wimbledon hopes afloat. Djokovic had an easier time against Kokkinakis than he did against Kwon Soon-woo in the first round, who put a set on the board to take it to four. Having seen out Wednesday’s clash 6-1 6-4 6-2, he is due to meet compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic, who beat Alejandro Tabilo to advance. After the match, Djokovic said: “I’m very happy with my performance today. Very solid from the back of the court and I made him work for every point. I tried to work him around the court, bring a lot of variety. From my side, overall, a really high-quality performance and I’m very pleased.” “I’m pleased with way I’ve raised the level of tennis in two days. Hopefully I can keep getting better as the tournament progresses.” FOLLOW THE MATCH AS IT HAPPENED BELOW...
