Ulrika gave her 191,000 Instagram followers an eyeful as she shared a snap of herself completely naked while sunbathing to her stories. Lying on a sunbed, the model could be seen intently scrolling on her phone wearing nothing but a green hat. Ulrika looked phenomenal as she displayed her flawless tan in her sun-drenched, green garden. The star captioned the story: "If it's good enough for @kendalljenner then it's good enough for this old bird (who's old enough to be her mamma)." She went on to share a link to her column in The Sun on the subject.
