The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly "had enough" of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after a failed "peacemaking" mission to heal the rift between them. A source told Heat magazine: “It seemed clear that Kate had no interest in playing nice with Meghan. And sad as it is, William feels the same. The view is that the Sussexes were lucky to receive any type of goodwill after the damage and embarrassment they've caused the monarchy. Neither side looks likely to back down." Prince Harry and Meghan visited the UK earlier this month for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, but both were reportedly snubbed by senior royals including William and Kate who did not attend Lilibet's first birthday party.
