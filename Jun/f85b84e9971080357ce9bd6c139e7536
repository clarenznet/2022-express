Rachel Riley, 36, married her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Pasha Kovlev, 42, in 2019. The couple married in Vegas in a small ceremony, with Rachel sharing a picture from the nuptials. She rocked a red and white mini dress, while Pasha looked dapper in chinos and a dark suit jacket. The Countdown co-presenter captioned the picture in view of her 539,000 Instagram followers: "What happened in Vegas didnâ€™t stay in Vegas. "3 years married to this gorgeous man, and counting! Celebrations to follow @pashakovalev." The couple have since gone on to have two daughters - Maven, two, and Noa, seven months.
