Wimbledon is nearing a deal with the WTA that would see players keep half their ranking points for this year’s Championships, according to reports. However, the ATP is said to be remaining firm in its stance that points will be withdrawn for the 2021 and 2022 editions of the tournament. Wimbledon was stripped of its ranking points by both govening bodies over its stance on Russia, leaving doubts over how many players will participate in the Championships this summer. Russian and Belarusian stars are barred from entering the draw over Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. According to the Daily Mail, Wimbledon are close to a 'compromise' with the WTA to ensure players compete at the Grand Slam. It comes after Naomi Osaka suggested that players from the women's draw might not attend if they do not receive their ranking points.

But I'm happy to see that the ATP and the players decided to show Wimbledon that when you make a wrong decision, there are consequences. The current withdrawal of ranking points would see last year’s finalist Karoline Pliskova lose 1,200 points, while the points Emma Raducanu earned during her breakthrough Slam would all be withdrawn. The WTA has apparently been liaising with players this week and a decision to allow them half their points is expected in the next few days.
