  Pop sensations Adele, 34, and Harry Styles, 28, reportedly turned down the opportunity to perform at the Platinum Jubilee weekend. The artists did not take to the stage as part of the four-day celebrations to honour the Queen's 70 years of service.     The Platinum Party at the Palace was a huge show as part of the Queen’s celebrations earlier this month. The event saw a number of global superstars perform outside Buckingham Palace, including the likes of Queen, Rod Stewart and Alicia Keys. Concert organisers were apparently keen for Adele to join the line-up. However, the Los Angeles-based reportedly turned them down, snubbing the concert in spite of being awarded an MBE for her services to music in 2013.
