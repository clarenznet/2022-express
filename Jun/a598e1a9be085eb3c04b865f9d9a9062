From a new roof to self-contained annexes, newly renovated kitchens and a conservatory, there are plenty of ways home improvements can add value to a home. Rated People has analysed more than 800,000 home improvement jobs on its platform as well as TikTok, Instagram and Google data to find out which home improvements are the most lucrative and which ones are the most on-trend. This year’s top five most popular trends, which can add £28,143 to a property’s value include herringbone floors, outdoor kitchens, living walls, green kitchens and home offices. Herringbone floors have clocked up more than 72 million views on TikTok as well as almost 100,000 hashtags on Instagram and 40,000 annual UK Google searches. Homeowners would pay around £5,500 more for a home if it had a herringbone flooring. Sixty percent of homeowners are planning to recreate one of the top 20 trends this year. Homeowners that implement all 20 into their home could increase their home’s value by £105,046.

She said: “Our priorities have been changing and it’s no surprise that some of the things that have recently helped to enhance our lives like home gyms and outdoor entertaining areas are now more valuable than ever to homebuyers. “Many of the 20 biggest home improvement and design trends could be achieved for less than £100 and a bit of DIY, which could see you make a nice profit if you’re looking to sell. “If you’re keener to tackle a bigger job like building a kitchen pantry or laying a herringbone floor, or if you just want that professional finish on a paint job, we’d recommend using a skilled local tradesperson to help bring your home improvement plans to life.”
