Missile strikes from Russian forces hit a primary school in the capital city early in the morning. Ukraine's rescue crews have since pulled women and children, including a seven-year-old girl from the rubble. Yarema Dukh, the former press secretary for Ukraine's GolosZmin political party, shared an image of the young girl being rescued from the debris, writing: "Any politician speaking of 'saving Putinâ€™s face; instead of providing more weapons to Ukraine should feel responsible for this." EU politicians have been slammed for not taking a tougher line on Putin, with some on the continent campaigning to open talks with the Russian president. Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russia's army struck at least two residential buildings during the bombardment and confirmed that two people had been hospitalised. It is the first attack by Vladimir Putin's forces on the capital city since June 5.
