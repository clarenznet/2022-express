In 2020 and 2021 the pandemic meant the spectacle was only available online. But yesterday 6,000 people saw the sun glint over the horizon at 4.49am at Wiltshire's neolithic site, built on the alignment of the midsummer sunrise and the midwinter sunset. English Heritage, which looks after the monument, said 170,000 worldwide watched the solstice online. Elsewhere, the longest day was welcomed at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, while the annual solstice swim at Ilkley Lido in West Yorkshire attracted 400 hardy fans.
