Her Majesty, 96, will be assisted by the Duke of Cambridge, 39, as she makes an extra Jubilee appearance at Windsor Castle on Thursday evening. It forms part of special dual ceremony with her grandson. At Windsor, the Queen will be greeted in the castle Quadrangle with a fanfare for the ceremony at the Sovereign's Entrance. The Commonwealth of Nations Globe - a blue globe, which sits inside a silver crown on a blue and gold cushion - will be placed on a podium. The Queen will touch the globe, symbolically triggering the lighting of the Tree of Trees beacon outside the Palace. It is part of a chain of more than 3,500 flaming tributes to her 70-year reign. William will be waiting 22 miles away at the Palace, where the beacon centrepiece - a 21-metre Tree of Trees sculpture - will be illuminated in lights on the Queen's command. The newly-announced engagement is an additional entry to the Queen's busy diary over the four-day weekend, which includes Trooping the Colour and a service of thanksgiving. The 96-year-old has been experiencing mobility difficulties in the past few months. She has recently had to cancel her attendance in other engagements, such as the State Opening of Parliament, which was carried out by her heir Prince Charles. Last week, it was also announced the Queen will miss her much-beloved Epsom Derby. Royal commentator Alastair Bruce told the Express.co.uk that the monarch will "try her best" during the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. He noted: "Nobody would expect someone who’s 96 to be made uncomfortable at an event that can be celebrated for her by everyone else who’s feeling good that day. "The mobility issues have been recurring, but from time to time, she is relieved of whatever is making her uncomfortable, as we saw at the Royal Windsor Horse Show."
