In the latest episode of Top Gear, Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris were on a mission to find second-hand cars for under £500. The trio then took the vehicles for a spin around a scrapyard before crushing them. However, the conclusion of the challenge left BBC viewers hitting out at the show. @Sweetwoo tweeted: “So what was the point in the cheap cars going around an assault course, like who's serious going too use them there. £364 seems like an unusual price for any car tbh. “And why actually scrap them, getting them crushed ultimately. What an absolute waste of good cars. #TopGear.” @laura_alice24 added: “‘Used car prices are skyrocketing, so we bought a few for £500 a pop, spent a few hours driving round a scrap yard and then crushed them for fun’ #topgear.” “Just channel surfing and caught @BBC_TopGear crush a Mazda 323f, what a waste, that car could have kept other finer examples stay on the road. Remember why I stopped watching now, old crew wouldn't have done that. #mazda #323f #deadshow,” @its_kyle256 wrote.

Also dear producers come up with new ideas #TopGear.” “Disgraceful how Top Gear forever destroy half decent cars just for viewing, when they could be donated to good causes in Ukraine, India or famil]ies that are struggling.  #BBCOne #TopGear,” @180Morg remarked. Elsewhere in Top Gear, Chris investigated Maserati's new MC20 supercar.   Meanwhile, Freddie sets off in the all-electric Rivian pick-up truck. In the series so far, Paddy, Freddie and Chris went on a road trip around Florida, gave bobsleighing a try and studied for thier HGV licences. Speaking to Express.co.uk, the presenting trio addressed a “scary” moment in the series opener. The team’s Florida visit culminated in a NASCAR-style race.
