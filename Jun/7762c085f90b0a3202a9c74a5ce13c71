Piers Morgan, 56, looked dapper as stepped out in his best top hat and suit with a glass of champagne at Ascot racecourse earlier today. The TalkTV presenter's wife of 12 years Celia Walden, looked equally as glamorous as they posed for pictures at the iconic venue this afternoon. The author and columnist opted for a red and white floor-length dress which she teamed with a large sun hat, with the words "Fun Day at the Races" etched on the front. The couple posed for pictures which Piers later shared on his social media account.
