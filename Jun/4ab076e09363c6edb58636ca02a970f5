Operose Health serves almost 600,000 patients in England. But an undercover reporter at one of the firm's London practices learnt it was short of eight doctors.   Less qualified, cheaper staff - called physician associates - were being hired. BBC's Panorama found Operose uses six times as many as the NHS does on average. The US-owned firm denied relying heavily on them and said it works "in the best interests of patients, providing access to the highest quality of care".
