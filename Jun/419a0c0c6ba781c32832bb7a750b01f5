The heir to the throne and wife Camilla posted three images yesterday with the caption: “Wishing everyone a very happy Father’s Day!” Among them was the poignant picture of the once-close Harry and Wills with kilt-wearing Charles at Birkhall on the Balmoral Estate. Charles, 73, also posted a photo with his father Prince Philip, who died aged 99 in April 2021. The third shot was Camilla, 74, and her father Major Bruce Shand at her wedding to Charles in 2005. The Queen, 96, also delved into the Royal Family archives and found a sweet snap of herself aged 20 with her father, King George VI, in 1946. William, who turns 40 tomorrow, looked like a lion king with his three little cubs roaring around him in his photograph, taken in Jordan last year.
