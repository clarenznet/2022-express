Deborah James, 40, has posted comparison photos on Instagram to show fans how things have changed for her over the past five years. She posted photos of herself over the year at one of her “favourite places”, Glyndebourne. The podcast host, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, shared the photos in view of her 943,000 followers. In the caption, she wrote: “I can’t believe I was last here 5 years ago this week - scared, newly diagnosed, just trying to do the same as I’m doing now - taking things one day at a time!! (See stories) “Anyone that’s followed me for years knows that the British season is my favourite time of the year hence why all my @inthestyle dresses are named after events!! So I figured My aim is just try to fit in a few whilst I’m still kicking around and am able to! "But be under no illusion! I’m knackered! I’ve worked out it takes me longer to get ready and organised to go than the time I actually last anywhere!! "Getting dressed is tiring, getting meds organised is tiring, the extra moving, the travel, the wondering what mood your stomach is in - its all real! "But then the feeling of making it to something you didn’t think possible, having put make-up on, donning new shoes (that finally arrived in the right size for massively swollen feet!), with the sunshine smiling - well then it’s all worth it! It’s a kind of cheeky “still living whilst dying” two fingers up to it all!!”
