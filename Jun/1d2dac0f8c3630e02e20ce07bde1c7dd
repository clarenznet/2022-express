Locals in posh St Ives, Cornwall, blamed the sat nav for the bungle, which reportedly saw the Move Moore van stuck on the steep road near the town's harbour for several hours. The vehicle was seen revving and struggling as it tried to reverse up the lane, home to houses and a museum, but eventually the driver gave up, locals said. The residents poked fun at the misadventure online, Cornwall Live reports. Referring to the name, one woman said: "Not really moving Moore is he?" Another Facebook user posted:  "Oh dear! Jay's Removals wouldn't have made this mistake! Hope the driver, property and customer belongings are okay! It's definitely handy to know the area especially with such narrow streets!" A third stated: "Another excellent reason for using a local firm who know the areas, someone like Safe and Sound Removals would not have made a mistake like this! I appreciate it is too late for these people, but useful for anyone else making the move." It appeared the Move Moore van had travelled more than 240 miles from Worcestershire to the pretty seaside town. A photograph of the vehicle, which was shared online, shows the van wedged against the back wall of a museum at a strange angle. Rebecca Fox, who took the snap of the van resting against the house opposite the museum, said the incident happened at about 4pm on Tuesday and by 8pm the van was still very much stuck. She said: "Apparently it’s the sat nav's fault." Daily Express has approached Move Moore for comment. It comes weeks after a Tesco delivery lorry driver became wedged down a side street in Montpelier, Bristol, for some 15 hours. Photographs show the driver of articulated lorry had appeared to turn a sharp right into the narrow road but became very much stuck.
