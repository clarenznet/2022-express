If you're looking for the best deals on the MacBook Pro (M2) 13-inch ...you're going to struggle to find any ludicrous discounts. That's because the refreshed MacBook Pro has only become available to buy from any online or high street store today. As such, you're unlikely to find retailers slashing prices to drum up sales. However, that's not to say there aren't any deals to be found on the MacBook Pro M2... Currys has a number of offers available on the M2-powered notebook. If you use the code FREENEXTDAYDEL at checkout, you'll be eligible for next-day delivery at no extra cost. The retailer usually charges £5 for next-day delivery during the week and £10 for a slot at the weekend, so it's not a bad saving at all. If you want a discount on your shiny new MacBook Pro, you can slash £225 off the cost of the M2 MacBook Pro 13-inch by trading in an old Apple laptop. That £225 fee is based on a MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019) with 8GB and an Intel Core i5 chipset. There's a comprehensive list of the previous MacBook models that you'll find at currys.co.uk/tradein. Amazon also has the new MacBook Pro (M2) in stock and Prime members will be able to get the notebook delivered next-day at no extra cost. In some areas, you might even be able to organise a same-day delivery for your new laptop. There are no discounts to be had, but you can make the MacBook Pro more affordable by spreading out the cost. Amazon includes the option to spread the cost of the latest Apple notebook over 12-months, paying £119.16 each month. That includes 10.9%, which will add a little to the overall cost but isn't the priciest payment plan. That accolade goes to Argos, which adds a galling 34.9% APR to the cost of the new MacBook Pro when you spread the cost over a 6-month payment plan. Currys charges 24.9% APR to pay off the new Apple laptop over 6 months. And finally, Argos could be a good pick to buy your new MacBook Pro M2 if you have a branch close to you as you might be able to pick up the notebook within a few hours. If you're desperate to get your hands on the latest MacBook from Cupertino, California – this could be the best option. As mentioned above, we'd recommend that your steer clear of Argos if you're looking to sign-up for a payment plan and spread out the cost. You can find our full thoughts in our in-depth MacBook Pro M2 review, but to summarise in a single word: yes. In a few more words than that: "At a glance, it might seem like nothing has changed with the new MacBook Pro 13-inch, but under the bonnet, there's one mighty upgrade that'll knock your socks off. Apple has added its all-new M2 system-on-a-chip, which helps it breeze through even the toughest tasks without a hint of a stutter. The M2 is around 35% faster than the 2020 MacBook Pro running the M1 chip, but it keeps the same price. "There's no question that the new MacBook Pro 13-inch is a highly capable machine, but it does stick out like a sore thumb in Apple's range of laptops. All of the Californian firm's latest machines, including the upcoming MacBook Air (with the same M2 chipset), now sport edge-to-edge screens, MagSafe charging, and real function keys rather than the controversial Touch Bar found on the MacBook Pro 13-inch." With any luck, we'll see some price drops and bundles coming very soon for this powerful new MacBook Pro. Below, you'll find the latest UK prices from a wide range of popular online retailers.
