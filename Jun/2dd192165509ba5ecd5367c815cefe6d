In all its senselessness and savagery, this Russian assault on a crowded shopping mall was far more than just an act of war. It was a crime against humanity, a blow for murderous despotism against civilisation, and a display of brutish cruelty against innocence. The aim of the attack was pure terror, based on Putin’s determination to shatter the morale of the Ukrainian people and intimidate them into submission. But he will not succeed. In the face of Russian aggression, the Ukrainians have proved they are made of stern stuff. This latest atrocity will only strengthen their resilience. “We need justice. We need sanctions. We need weapons,” declared the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun. That is exactly what the West is trying to provide – and a huge amount of credit for this tough stance belongs to Boris Johnson. From the first moment of Russia’s barbaric invasion, he has proved a stalwart defender of liberty, galvanising Western military aid for the Kyiv government and presiding over the imposition of an unprecedented array of sanctions on Moscow. Britain under Boris emerged as Ukraine’s staunchest ally. Now Boris has again been at the forefront of the international effort against Russia. During the G7 Summit in Bavaria, he has once more shown his authority by ensuring that there is no erosion in support for Ukraine, despite the length and cost of the struggle. In clear, confident language, the Prime Minister drew an analogy with the fight against Nazi Germany, when the Allies expended vast amounts of blood and treasure. Yet those sacrifices guaranteed the democracy and prosperity in the decades that followed. After yesterday’s horror, the parallel between the Third Reich and Putin’s regime looks all too appropriate. He has played his valiant part in standing up to Russia, but it is now clear that even more defiance will be needed on the hard road ahead.
