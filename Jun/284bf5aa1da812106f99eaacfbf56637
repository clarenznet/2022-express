   RuPaul’s Drag Race UK star Tayce Szura-Radix has criticised the episode of Celebrity Gogglebox she partook in back in September of last year. The star explained that she didn’t agree with the ‘Black to Front’ concept the show opted for as part of a wider project across Channel 4, in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk.      Tayce, 28, recently attended the launch of ABSOLUT’S Born to Mix fashion collaboration in London two weeks ago, where she teamed up with celebrity favourite London designer, Chet Lo, and the team from the next gen collection Institute of Digital Fashion for a cutting-edge runway show. Before Tayce took to the catwalk, however, she opened up about her time on Celebrity Gogglebox. Last year, Celebrity Gogglebox announced a brand new roster for its Black to Front episode, which included stars such as model Jourdan Dunn, EastEnders legend Rudolph Walker and RuPaul’s Drag Race UK stars Tayce and Tia Kofi. The episode came as part of Channel 4's wider Black to Front day of programming, which aimed to amplify "black talent, voices and stories", as part of an "ongoing commitment to improve Black representation on- and off-screen".

That’s how it should be. Day dot. AM. PM.” When asked if she meant that she believed in television being inclusive all the time, rather than inclusivity being reserved for allocated spaces, she confirmed: “Yeah! It’s that simple. “Why are there all these rules and regulations about how one thing should be on TV and one thing shouldn’t be on TV? “It should just be just an iPod on shuffle!” READ MORE...
