The suspect is described as a light-skinned male, possibly mixed race, aged 16 or 17, who is usually wearing a grey tracksuit.

We in the Central East Command Unit share that concern and are doing everything we can to identify and bring to justice the person responsible. "It is imperative that he is identified but we need the public's help. Anyone who has information that they think can help us is urged to make contact immediately."

In January, nearly 200 women shared their experiences as part of the Women’s Safety in public spaces in Hackney project, launched by Hackney Council on November 25, 2021. Many of the comments were left by women who feel unsafe walking in certain areas of the borough at night because they say it is "too dark" or "deserted," or because there are regular "gangs of men loitering".
