Meghan Markle once ran a lifestyle blog called 'The Tig', where she discussed food, fashion, exercise, travel and beauty. In one particular post, the now Duchess shared her love of pilates. It is well known that the Duchess of Sussex is partial to a yoga session. In fact, her mother, Doria Ragland, is actually an instructor.

This Meghan Markle approved exercise is inexpensive and can be done anywhere, keeping you "fit while travelling". It also takes just six minutes. Paper plates can be swapped for towels. Start on a non-carpeted floor. Place a paper plate underneath your left foot. Keeping your right leg stationary and pressing through the right heel, slide your left foot behind you, keeping your leg straight. Your heel can lift off the ground as you lower your right leg down into a 90 degree angle behind the knee. Hold this pose for a moment before sliding your left foot back forward to meet your right foot. Next, push your left foot forward to achieve a 90 degree angle in your left leg. Alternate between these two sides for one minute. The second exercise is the same as the first, except without the forward motion. Your left foot is only going to move backwards, lowering the right leg into a 90 degree position. Straighten up and repeat the backwards lunge for one minute. Hold your last rep with the right leg at 90 degrees during your minute to transition smoothly into your next minute.
