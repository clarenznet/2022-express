The budget supermarket chain confirmed on social media that its opening times will remain the same for the duration of the Bank Holiday. However, Tesco and Asda will close its large supermarkets at 8pm on Bank Holiday Thursday and Friday, and most Lidls and Sainsbury's will also shut their doors early today and tomorrow to allow staff to celebrate the Jubilee. A social media post from Aldi's said: "We're open for the Jubilee Celebration! Make sure you head down to get all your essentials for the weekend! Our normal opening hours will remain in place this Bank Holiday weekend." And shoppers were quick to slam the chain, which has more than 900 branches in the UK. Many Facebook users said staff deserve a break, reports Manchester Evening News. One woman posted: "Shame for the staff… not even Bank Holiday hours. Shame on you… hope it’s double time and a day in lieu." Another wrote: "How lovely would it be for people to get organised and do their food shop on the Wednesday so shops could close for two days so staff could join in with the celebrations." A third said: "Aww give your staff some time off! Misery guts." Aldi has confirmed staff will be given time off in lieu of working either of the Bank Holidays. And the supermarket was backed by a minority, who argued many employees in the public sector have to work Bank Holidays frequently. One man said: "Not everyone gives a s*** about the outdated titular and completely useless monarchy. Let them earn a wage if they choose." Another Facebook user wrote: "Love everyone saying for them to close and give their staff the bank holiday off. They aren't the only ones working it. I work every bank holiday and don't get extra pay for it." A spokesperson for Aldi said: "All Aldi colleagues working over the bank holiday will get time off in lieu. We are very grateful to everyone at Aldi who is working this weekend to help our customers get everything they need to celebrate the Jubilee."
