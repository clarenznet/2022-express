The Loose Women host, 51, enjoyed an early anniversary dinner with Sir Rod Stewart, 77, and took to Instagram to share a sweet snap. Penny ensured all eyes were on her as the blonde beauty stunned in a stylish dress as she was accompanied by her beloved Rod. The mum-of-two looked chic in a cream dress while she sported a pair of gold heels. She accompanied her look with a cream fur coat as she wrapped her arms behind the Maggie May singer, who is kicking off his upcoming North American tour on June 14 at the Hollywood Bowl. Sir Rod looked equally dapper in a white shirt, matching trousers and a black blazer as he leaned into his wife of over a decade. In view of her 156,000 followers, Penny captioned the post: "Early 15th anniversary dinner, before Rod flys off for his long awaited shows #hollywoodbowl #santabarbrabowl." Her beau is set to embark on his worldwide tour as she bid farewell to her husband in the sweet message. Sir Rod shared the snap via his own account, and captioned the post: "Love of my life."
