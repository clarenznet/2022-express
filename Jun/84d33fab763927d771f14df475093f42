The last two years have been truly dreadful for most of humanity with officially more than six million deaths from COVID worldwide, which I believe is a gross underestimateas I am informed by colleagues that in many countries COVID deaths are only recorded as such if they occur in hospital and they put the real number of deaths at over 20 million.  I put the real figure as potentially far higher. Why?, due to the millions of people (world wide) who did not attend hospital with fatal heart attacks, strokes, signs of early cancer etc.In the UK alone, there are over six million people on waiting lists for operations and treatments, a figure greatly enhanced by two years of COVID priority. Even worse is the damage caused to all age groups by lockdown and isolation. I have just heard of the fourth person I knew well who has committed suicide because of lockdown and its repercussions.We must never forget how this apocalyptic state came about. It was entirely due to the dreadful decisions made by China in the shape of the CCP. The emergence of COVID-19 officially occurred in December 2019, although I believe it was present before that especially as there were strange events going on in Wuhanas early as September such as the unexplained taking down of a coronavirus data bank which was a world wide source as Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is the major centre in the world for research in these viruses.Their excuse with no sense of irony, to prevent this open data base source from being hacked!When the disease did emerge in Wuhan they claimed that there was no evidence for human-to-human transmission. When local doctors warned that this was clearly not the case, they disappeared only to be reported as dying of COVID.  When it was clearly evident that it was highly infectious and spreading rapidly, they locked down completely, locally and in the rest of China, but did not stop flights internationally from Wuhan with several a day arriving in the UK at the height of our first wave.This virus should never have left China if correct procedures had been adhered to.Why were they ignored? It would appear to go back to SARS-1which caused an outbreak 17 years before, when China was criticised by the World Health Organisation (WHO)  for the way it was handled. China's response was to essentially take control of the WHO by arranging the election of the first non medical director (whose country was in hock to China's support ) namely Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuswho, it is claimed, was instructed to look away while China repeated their previous mistakes.The world needs to be in no doubt that had this been handled properly that COVID would never have left China.Indeed, the UK government had been assured that such an epidemic would never leave Asia due to procedures put in place by the previous head of the WHO.Many have said that it takes much more than arrogance and incompetence to allow its spread worldwide while endorsing zero COVID at home!We need to be aware that China has been stirring on many fronts as a much more successful system of government than those of the West.  See the latest Covid vaccine stats below and visit InYourArea for all the Covid vaccine latest This is one of the reasons that we all suffered from lockdown and other unnecessary miseries such as masks and enforced isolation.The west concluded that China knows best and that we must copy them with totally unnecessary lockdowns, totally ignoring rational and sensible medics who realised that this is an airborne virus that only kills elderly and vulnerable people and that simple measures such as vitD3 and anti-inflammatories could prevent disease progression and that its rapid spread would induce herd immunity as pointed out by the doctors (of which I was one) of the Great Barrington declaration.We were viciously attacked as mad mavericks as project fear and the vaccine programme was rolled out worldwide.Only Sweden had a sensible medical advisor and avoided lockdown with no child there missing a day's schooling.Interestingly it is now clear that the harder the lock down the worst the deaths.This insidious obedience to China has effectively infected every major institution in the west.It was immediately obvious to anyone with any intelligence and curiosity that this virus was not a normal coronavirus as it had several features shared with engineered viruses that the Wuhan Institute had published as making them more infectious to human cells. The reason for this research known as gain of Function (GOF) was claimed to be to be able to understand how to deal with the next pandemic, ironically oblivious, presumably,they were about to cause it.I am not surprised that China lied and tried to blame some poor bat thousands of miles away in a cave, but I was truly horrified that nearly all politicians and scientists accepted this nonsense, whilst censoring my colleagues and I from publishing in scientific journals.I was told that I should have been aware that China funds many of our major Universities, including the China centre at Cambridge and controls the narrative of most scientific journals now, and hence politicians are in thrall to them.This must stop.The unnecessary COVID pandemic has led to the dreadful effects of the lockdown, rapid inflation, supply line collapses, high energy prices, and the coming recession andthe political environment for Putin to feel he could get away with invading Ukraine. I for one want reparations for this crime of the century as we will pay a higher price in the future if we do not hold China to account now.For those who wish to read more evidence for this article I recommend "Viral" by Chan and Ridley and "The origin of the virus" by Barnard, Quay and myself, they are very complimentary.*Prof Angus Dalgleish is Foundation Professor of Oncology at St George's, University of London.
