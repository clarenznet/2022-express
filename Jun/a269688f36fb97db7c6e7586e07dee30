Ed Harris, 71, looked very dapper as he attended the premiere for season four of HBO's Westworld in New York last night. The Hollywood actor took to the red carpet in all black as he celebrated the new series. Ed debuted his new longer hairstyle as he posed for pictures alongside his co-stars including Aaron Paul, James Marsden, Luke Hemsworth and Jeffrey Wright. While losing the hair on the top of his head, the actor has kept the sides and back of his strawberry blonde locks long, leaving a bob-style length. Westworld follows a group of android hosts as they deviate from their programmers' carefully planned scripts in a disturbing pattern of aberrant behavior. It's based on Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton's 1973 sci-fi film of the same name, which he wrote and directed.
