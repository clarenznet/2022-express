Deborah James, who recently received a damehood from the Queen, is receiving end-of-life care after doctors declared they could no longer treat the 40-year-old's progressing cancer. Many have been inspired by Dame Deborah's fundraising efforts, including Kim Murray. Kim was spotted cheering on her husband Andy Murray during the first day of Wimbledon 2022 yesterday in one of the Rebellious Hope branded T-shirts that the BBC podcast host has designed, with the proceeds going to cancer charities. The star's brow was furrowed in concern as she watched her husband battle it out against James Duckworth on Centre Court. However, her white InTheStyle T-shirt noticeably carried the message representing Deborah's struggle. After Andy paved his way to victory, Lorraine Kelly took to Twitter to praise: "Well@done @andy_murray - and huge thanks to his wife Kim wearing a @bowelbabe “Rebellious Hope” fund raising T-shirt! Class acts x." Meanwhile Kim was also seen embracing her mother-in-law Judy, who was also at the match in a display of support for her son.
