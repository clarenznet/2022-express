After becoming Queen sooner than expected at 25, she committed herself to duty and caring for her country. She praises the support she had from her devoted husband but her own philosophies are also an excellent path to follow for a fulfilling life. No wonder the Queen is celebrating her 70 years of keeping her promise to the nation. Let us all give thanks and rejoice. Christine Kershaw, Minehead, Somerset --------------------------------- Queen’s legacy to us all is of service and devotion We're enjoying days of festivities across the UK and Commonwealth, celebrating the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The world has changed since Her Majesty ascended the throne. She has remained a staunch defender of the values of faith, family and freedom, consistent with her Christianity in a modern Britain. Her legacy has been as a purposeful monarch and beacon of light in a dark world. God save the Queen. David Fleming, Downham Market, Norfolk --------------------------------- Anti-democratic leaders aren’t a patch on Queen What a fabulous Jubilee parade. All the anti-royalists who want to get rid of the Queen should look at Russia and China. All they’ve got are tinpot dictators who only parade weapons of mass destruction and keep democracy out of reach of the population. I for one would not want that way of life. David Warner, Derby --------------------------------- Trooping The Colour was a magnificent occasion What a spectacle Trooping The Colour was. The pageantry, tradition, the magnificent flypast. It made one proud to be British. The icing on the cake was to see our much-loved Queen appearing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Carole Gates, Swansea
