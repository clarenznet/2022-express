BBC One aired The Platinum Party at the Palace as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations on Saturday night. The star-studded event outside Buckingham Palace featured a plethora of famous faces. Diana Ross closed the show with a medley of her biggest hits, but viewers could not understand why she was chosen as the headline act.  Taking to Twitter to share their thoughts, @_Kano_P said: "Where was Paul McCartney? Has he upset someone? #PlatinumPartyatthePalace" @retsgitS shared: "#PlatinumPartyatthePalace Buck Palace looks amazing but Elton to end it or Turner or Bassey. Just saying. Or Stevie Wonder. That was a poor ending." @GoddardEm said: "I think I could have done with a bit of Tom Jones #PlatinumPartyatthePalace." @omarstandup concluded: "Diana Ross seems an odd choice as headliner. You’d think it’d be someone British…. Adele, maybe. #PlatinumPartyatthePalace."
