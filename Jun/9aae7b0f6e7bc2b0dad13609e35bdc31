Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall arrived in the first carriage of the traditional daily royal procession alongside Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt - Master of the Household. The Queen confirmed she would not be attending the second day of the race either but the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall ensured she could be present in spirit. The pair was noted to have left an empty seat in their carriage, with ITV commentator Ed Chamberlain suggesting it was a symbolic nod to Her Majesty.  Mr Chamberlain said: "I'm just assuming that the seat is left empty as a mark of respect because Her Majesty The Queen is not here today. "Let's hope she comes tomorrow, tomorrow is the day of the Gold Cup. "But the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles are very much at the forefront again." Co-presenter Charlotte Hawkins added: "We're keeping our fingers crossed that the Queen will be able to join us at some point but I think you're right about leaving that empty seat in her honour.
