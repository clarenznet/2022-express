The C-17 Globemaster III, owned by the military, took off from RAF Brize Norton at 12.52pm and headed northwest. It reached the Merseyside area, where it swooped low and circled multiple times over Liverpool. Witnesses said it spent nearly one hour hovering before heading southeast again. The aircraft reached the Oxfordshire RAF base at around 2.40pm. The C-17 Globemaster III is a long-range transport aircraft, reports Liverpool Echo. The heavy-lift strategic transport aircraft can operate close to a potential area of operations for combat, peacekeeping or humanitarian missions worldwide. C-17 is capable of rapid, strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases anywhere in the world.   The Globemaster’s load-bearing rear ramp and digitally controlled loading systems, combined with the skills of its crews and ground handlers, enable large, complex items of equipment, including Chinook helicopters, military vehicles and other heavy items of specialist kit to be loaded. The RAF carries out training exercises across the UK in readiness to deploy around the world at any given moment, just as it did in 2017 to help with the Caribbean hurricane relief effort and its ongoing Operation Rescript which is helping to tackle the pandemic. When carrying out training activities, the RAF tries to keep local residents aware via social media. However, it is not always possible for to alert people or say how long exercises will continue for security reasons. It comes days after two other massive RAF aircraft were seen flying low over nearby north Wales. Footage showed on Wednesday the RAF C130 Hercules Jigsaw-1 and Jigsaw-2 travelling above Conwy and Llandudno, North Wales. It is believed the RAF was conducting a routine training exercise from its base on that occasion.
