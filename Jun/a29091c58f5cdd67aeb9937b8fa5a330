Simon Cowell and his fianc√©e Lauren Silverman put on a loved-up display yesterday following the third night of the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals. It comes as the couple prepare to walk down the aisle later this year. The talent boss, 62, and his socialite fiancee, 44, looked more loved-up than ever as they relaxed in the back of a waiting car which featured smart, white leather seats. Lauren grinned as she clasped the hand of her fiance while showing off her blinding, diamond engagement ring. She donned a strapless black corset top with a sheer panel underneath her breasts, which she paired with a beige number on her lower half. The star added a touch of glamour to her outfit with a metallic gold handbag, gold watch and of course, her statement engagement ring. Simon cut his usual smart figure in a tailored black suit which he paired with a smart white shirt. The couple, who have been together for almost a a decade, confirmed the happy news of their engagement in January.
