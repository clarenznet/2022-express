Julia Goulding, 37, looked as sensational as ever in the wake of her baby announcement, and demonstrated a cool, calm and confident demeanour on tonight's red carpet. The Coronation Street star, who plays Shona Platt on the soap, wore a long black off-the-shoulder gown to celebrate the best of this year's soaps. She protectively cradled her baby bump with her burgundy nail varnished hands, while vamping it up in matching deep red lipstick. The monochromatic zebra-style print went down a treat with the public as she smiled for the cameras.
