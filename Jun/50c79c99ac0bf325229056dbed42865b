Lennox, who achieved worldwide fame as one half of the Eurythmics, was awarded an OBE in 2011 for her humanitarian work. But after rediscovering her award in a box the other day, she took to Instagram to express her dissatisfaction with the term "Officer of the British Empire". In her post, Lennox suggested the word "excellence" should be used instead, reports The Scottish Daily Express. Writing to her 515,000 followers, she said: "I found my OBE in a box yesterday. It’s a beautiful object and I still feel very honoured to have been given such an acknowledgement. "The letters stand for Officer of the British Empire. In all truth I feel conflicted by the word ‘empire’ and wonder if it isn’t time for a change: "Perhaps the word ‘excellence’ would be a better replacement?" She was backed up by TV presenter Anita Rani, who replied: "Yes to this". Born in Aberdeen on Christmas Day, Lennox is known for her activism, especially in raising awareness of AIDS in Africa. She has also been a vocal supporter of the LGBTQ community. She received her OBE from The Queen at Buckingham Palace in June 2011. When her honour was announced in December 2010, she said: "I'm genuinely honoured to be part of the New Year's Honours list for 2010. "As somewhat of a renegade, it either means I've done something terribly right - or they've done something terribly wrong. "In any case, whatever powers that be have deemed me worthy of such a recognition, I'm getting my fake leopard pillbox hat dusted and ready." In 2012, she featured in the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? and discovered that her maternal grandmother, Dora Paton, was a dairy maid at the Balmoral and her maternal grandfather, William Ferguson, was a gamekeeper also at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire. She backed the Union in the 2014 independence referendum.
