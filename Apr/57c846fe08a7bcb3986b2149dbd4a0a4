Traffic is currently being diverted away from Junction 31 of the M25 at the Dartford Crossing just outside London due to concerns for a woman on the bridge. Essex Police released a statement at 11.18am to say they were called to the area shortly after 10 am this morning.  Police confirmed they had been called out due to "concerns for the welfare of a woman," and have now closed the Dartford River Crossing. Traffic is reportedly being diverted away from Junction 31 of the M25 where it meets the A282, while the incident is dealt with. Reports suggest it could be "a few hours" before the area reopens. According to the latest update, two lanes of the M25 Dartford Tunnels anticlockwise are currently closed between Junction 1a A206 (Dartford) and 31 A1306 (Lakeside / Purfleet), causing extensive queueing traffic along the motorway, according to traffic monitoring website INRIX. The incident is reported to be causing congestion halfway back to Junction 3 of the M20 (Swanley Interchange), and far back along the A2 to Dartford Heath, and back towards Bluewater. Essex posted on Facebook to say National Highways will be facilitating a diversion through one of the tunnels "whilst the incident is being dealt with."
