Images of executed civilian bodies left lying in the streets of the town close to the capital shocked the world. Just 15 miles away, Ukrainian soldiers marching back into Borodyanka were said to have again been greeted by horrifying scenes. Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the scale of devastation and murder there was only starting to become clear. The Ukrainian president, inset, said: “The work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It’s much worse there. “Even more victims of the Russian occupiers. “And what will happen when the world learns the whole truth about what the Russian military did in Mariupol? “There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The same cruelty. The same heinous crimes.” Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said rescue workers recovered the bodies of 26 people left to die in the rubble of two destroyed apartment buildings in Borodyanka. She claimed: “Only the civilian population was targeted: there is no military site here.” It was “impossible to predict” how many more dead there were at the site. Ms Venediktova said the Russians had used cluster bombs and heavy multiple rocket launchers. “Evidence of the Russian forces’ war crimes is at every turn.”
