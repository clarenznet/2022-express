The popular comedian Steve Coogan began his career in the 1980s as a voice actor on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, however, it was after he co-created Norwich DJ Alan Partridge that the actor became renowned. Since his debut in 1991, Alan, who was known for being hilariously unfiltered, has appeared in radio and television series', books, and his very own feature film. Speaking to Channel 4 hosts Simon Rimmer and Tim Lovejoy on Sunday Brunch, the comic defended his legendary character who would often leave viewers cringing over his socially inept interactions, saying he’s more than just a “right-wing reactionary”. Speaking on the programme, Tim asked the comic: “Why is Partridge the returning character? “Why is he the one that you keep coming back to?” the presenter probed. Steve replied: “Well, I used to do a bunch of characters years ago and I thought, I wanted to move on to other things and not just be Alan [Partridge]. “But when I was able to do that, if it will, I didn’t want to get all pretentious. I still wanted to have a laugh,” the comedy writer added: “So I thought the most versatile one really was Alan Partridge.” READ MORE: A Place in the Sun buyer slams counter offer in ‘tense’ negotiations “All the characters I ever did were always a receptacle for dysfunction and ideas you have [and] things you think sometimes that you shouldn't think.” Describing his character as a “bucket” in which he throws inside all his unfiltered content, Steve explained: “We all edit ourselves, you might think something when you're in [people’s] company but you think, ’I probably shouldn't think that. I won't say that, I’ll say this [instead], but Alan doesn't have that.” The TV star left both presenters in fits of laughter before Simon chuckled: “He's a bit of a loser and a bit of an underdog but we like him for that.” Discussing how his character has evolved since his debut in 1991, the stand-up star said: “I think years ago when I started doing [Alan], people used to think, ‘Oh, thank goodness, I didn’t say that’, but I think now, there's a, sort of, younger audience who see their parents in him.” While defending the Norwich DJ, Steve went on to say: “Rather than Alan being, sort of, just a right-wing reactionary, he’s trying to do the right thing [by] trying to be on message.” The comedy character's disastrous attempts at broadcasting have had fans in stitches since his first appearance on BBC Radio 4's On the Hour. Furthermore, fans were in hysterics as the iconic broadcaster took over as the guest announcer on Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway. “It’s me, Alan Partridge, and I’m here to promote my live show!" Alan quipped as he greeted the audience. He then tried to pitch the Geordie hosts with a brand new TV show where they play "tough" detectives. Viewers took to Twitter to comment on how they thought Alan was the show's best guest announcer yet. @ProperDribbly gushed: "Alan Partridge the best presenter of the 3 #SaturdayNightTakeaway." @cypherspace wrote: "Alan Partridge on #SaturdayNightTakeaway is inspired."

How has no one thought to get him on this show before." Another user, @KyleSew2112 wrote: "Oh I love Alan partridge #SaturdayNightTakeaway." One fan requested more TV appearances from the comic, with @OliReading saying: "#SaturdayNightTakeaway Aha.
