Gillian Harrison, 65, was already embroiled in a dispute with her neighbour over parking when he submitted an application to put up a fence by their properties. A court heard the pensioner was overheard calling the victim, who is a dad, vile racist names and, on another occasion, told him to go "back to his own country". Sentencing at Teesside Magistrates' Court, District Judge Helen Cousins branded the behaviour disgusting. She said: "This was disgraceful behaviour which I'm disgusted by, I hope you are ashamed. However, you did admit the offence and it's been hanging over your heard for two years. I'm told there have been no more issues." But Harrison was spared jail today and instead fined £200, ordered to pay £100 compensation, £85 court costs and £34 to fund victim services. The harassment happened on a number of occasions between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020, Teesside Live reports. In a victim impact statement, the neighbour said: "I have a four-year-old son and was concerned to let him out in the back garden in case he heard the abuse. I just want to live a peaceful life." Harrison, from Hartlepool, County Durham, pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment. She was visibly upset in court but spoke to confirm her name, address, and enter her guilty plea. In mitigation, the defence said the woman has no previous convictions and pleaded guilty straight away. It was also claimed she accepts it's her fault and there have been no further issues since 2020.
