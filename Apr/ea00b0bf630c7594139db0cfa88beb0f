The Duke of Sussex has revealed his intense feelings about the Ukrainian team during the Games. The Russian invasion did not stop Team Ukraine from competing at the Invictus Games, an international sporting event in the Netherlands founded by the Duke of Sussex. Speaking to the BBC he said: "A whole world is definitely behind them. But again, is that is that enough? When you get to see them and speak to them, and see in their eyes, the experiences and the things that they've seen just in the last few weeks it's really hard, it's emotional." The Duke said he "struggled" for 24 hours thinking about what to say to the athletes — many of whom were serving in the army before competing in the games. Speaking at the opening ceremony to Team Ukraine, Prince Harry said: "Your bravery in choosing to come, and being here tonight, cannot be overstated. You told me yesterday when you decided to join us, despite all odds, you said you came to be on this global stage—not simply to show your strength, but to tell your truth."
