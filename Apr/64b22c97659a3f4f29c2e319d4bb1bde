The European Union no longer accepts “pet passports” issued in Britain, even if they were issued before Brexit. Britons must now pay around £180 for an “Animal Healthcare Certificate” from a vet before they decide to go overseas with their furry friends. The certificates are valid for just four months, so a new one will have to be issued multiple times for frequent travellers. As the red tape is only on the EU side, travellers can be crafty and obtain EU pet passports in EU states for as little as €20, according to Pets That Travel, a consultancy. The Government is currently trying to slash the red tape so that British pet passports can once again be accepted by EU nations. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
