The TUC said female staff were already being hit by the public sector pay squeeze, earning £90 a month less in real terms than a year ago. Rising inflation will cut their pay packets cut even more in 2022, said the unions body. Its analysis showed nurses’ real wages are down more than £2,700 on a year ago and local government care workers’ pay is £1,600 less. The TUC wants Chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce an emergency Budget to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Its general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Women already suffer from the punishing gender pay gap. The Government cannot look on as women across Britain are pushed deep into the red.”
