Welsh Secretary Simon Hart yesterday claimed the majority of the public wants the Prime Minister to apologise rather than resign. Mr Hart said "the world has moved on a considerable distance" since the "Partygate" scandal erupted. He insisted people see the war in Ukraine as a far bigger issue now. Mr Hart said: "I have 65,000 constituents in west Wales, where I represent, and they are not shy in coming forward and expressing a view about this and a number of other subjects. "And throughout all of this saga of the Downing Street parties they have said one thing very clearly, and in a vast majority they say they want contrition and they want an apology. But they don't want a resignation." Mr Hart spoke after it emerged police have issued fixed-penalty notices to several members of the Downing Street staff involved in a drinks event at Number 10 on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral in April last year. Mr Johnson did not attend the party and is not understood to have received a fixed-penalty notice for any lockdown breach. But the Metropolitan Police investigation into the gatherings is continuing. Mr Hart said that "of course" it did not sit comfortably with him that parties were being held in Downing Street during the Covid restrictions. In a separate interview, the Welsh Secretary said: "Looking at what we're seeing in Ukraine, that helps contextualise all of this in my head." "I think we're now dealing with something of such seriousness and such horror." "What went on maybe two years ago clearly needs to be dealt with, and should be - it's a source of irritation for a lot of people still - but I'm glad that this thing is now coming to a conclusion." Downing Street yesterday declined to say whether Mr Johnson had accepted Covid laws were broken at No 10 after fines were issued. The PM's spokesman said: "The Prime Minister wants to comment at the conclusion of the process and not at the middle of it."
