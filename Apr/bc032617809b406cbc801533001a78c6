Daniel Baker, who used to work for the chain, said customers should look out for single numbers on labels, as some identify stock that cannot be purchased as cheaply elsewhere. He appears on Channel 5 documentary TK Maxx: How do they do it?, which offers a glimpse of what really goes on behind the store doors. On the programme, Daniel says: "On any label, you can see a number. The number that is really exciting to a customer is number two because that means it’s genuine stock that was sold at a higher price somewhere else. "It’s excess stock or something like that." According to Daniel, the numbers usually go from one up to nine but "quite a few of them" aren't used, and some are more significant to buyers than others, reports Daily Mirror. Daniel added: "The main three codes are one, two, and seven. "One means produced for TK Maxx, two is 'close out buy' that is unsold from another brand, and seven is ‘packaway’ which means it’s been packed for a previous year, like Christmas crackers bought in January for the following year. "You can get good value for money on a type one. It could be that just the sheer volume they are producing means they can price it cheaper. "The real bargains you are looking for are a two and a seven for sure. That’s also part of the treasure hunt when I go into a store as I’m constantly going ‘oh that’s a type two, that’s a real bargain there." TK Maxx, founded in the US in 1976, has more than 300 stores in the UK. It opened its first UK outlet in Bristol in 1994.
