Motorists could be easily caught out by small chips on the glass. And with the windscreen being an essential part of a car’s structure, any cracks or chips could prove costly for British drivers. Scratches in the windscreen are not just unsightly, but they could also compromise a driver's vision and result in a costly fine. On top of the heavy fines, motorists could have three penalty points added to their licence for having their visibility impeded. The windscreen acts as protection from wind and rain, and a clear, undamaged glass pane is essential to be able to drive safely. A scratched window could be caused by stone chips or loose road debris but will inevitably affect how well the driver can see the road. If chips develop into cracks, motorists may be unable to see approaching traffic or other road hazards.

The Highway Code dictates that drivers need to have a full and clear view of the road ahead so the glass must therefore be in a good condition. If driving with a cracked windscreen and an accident occurs, motorists could also be charged with a more serious driving offence for "using a vehicle in a dangerous condition." A small crack could see motorists slapped with a £50 Fixed Penalty Notice if pulled over by police. Damage to the glass that is 40mm in size could even result in an MOT fail, so it's important to make this simple check before driving. If the scratch reflects light, dazzling the driver, drivers could be charged with "failure to have a full view of the road ahead", which itself carries a maximum £1,000 penalty. Andrew Marshall, from CarMoney, said: "Keeping on top of car maintenance can feel like a chore, but if you don’t take care of issues quickly, they could prove dangerous. “Not only will regular services identify potential early issues, but they could also help you save money and avoid costly repairs further down the line. "Always seek professional advice for any vehicle problems that may pose a risk to your safety and that of other road users." “It is vital to fix scratches on the glass before they develop into cracks. “Any scratch deeper than 50 microns should be looked at by a professional. “If drivers can run their finger across the affected area and the scratch does not catch their fingernail, the scratch can be fixed at home using car glass polish and a micro fibre cloth." Preventing chips and scratches to a windscreen: In colder temperatures, windscreens can freeze and changes in temperature can cause the glass to crack. Therefore, drivers should avoid pouring hot or boiling water directly onto the glass. Drivers should replace windscreen wipers once a year to make sure they're removing debris that builds up and could cause a scratch. Drivers should check their windscreen for damage and seek help to repair any small cracks and prevent chips from becoming larger. Motorists should drive carefully on uneven road surfaces to avoid stones and gravel hitting the glass and be sure to travel at the correct distance from the vehicle in front at all times.
