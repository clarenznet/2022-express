This temporary cut is due to continue until at least 2024 which provides us with a perfect opportunity to review exactly where our foreign aid money should be going to maximise its impact. Recently, a TaxPayers’ Alliance investigation found that the UK spent over £112 million on foreign aid projects in India and Pakistan during the 2020/21 financial year. Whilst this cash does go on some noble initiatives, large chunks of this money go on projects such as expanding India’s energy security and independence.I may be off the mark, but at a time of rampant inflation and a cost-of-living crisis all fuelled further by a bloody and heart-rending war in Ukraine, sending tens of millions to a country with its own space programme will leave a horrible taste for many ordinary Brits who are struggling to make ends meet.It’s important to note that both India and Pakistan have also been markedly absent from the international community’s efforts to stop Russia’s horrifying aggression in Ukraine.While we were imposing sanctions on Putin’s regime, Pakistan’s Prime Minister at the time met with the Russian President on the exact day Putin launched his illegal invasion. Pakistan has also unashamedly been pressing ahead with a Russian-built gas pipeline and while the UK and US banned Russian oil and gas imports, India purchased at least 13 million barrels of Russian crude oil since the invasion began. As a further insult to the plight of the Ukrainian people, both Pakistan and India opted to abstain on both the UN resolution condemning Russia’s war of aggression and the motion to boot Russia out of the UN Human Rights Council, opting instead to turn a blind eye to atrocities and war crimes committed in Bucha. As a nation that is leading the democratic Western efforts to stop Putin, we must be strong on those who continue to appease dictators, particularly when they are a part of the Commonwealth. While we make serious economic sacrifices in the name of protecting democracy, India and Pakistan continue to fund Russia’s war machine. Perhaps instead of sending blood money to Putin, they might consider helping their own people.
