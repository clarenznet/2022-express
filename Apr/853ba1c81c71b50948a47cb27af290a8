The Prime Minister said it would be "irresponsible" to take the toughest restrictions "off the table" for good. He told Tory MPs Esther McVey and Philip Davies on GB News that some curbs had been "inhuman" and it was "appalling" not seeing loved ones. But he said: "I think it would be irresponsible of any leader in any democracy to say that they're going to rule out something that can save lives. I believe the things we did saved lives. Worrying "There could be a new variant more deadly...that affects children, that we really need to contain." Mr Johnson also said former Premier Margaret Thatcher would have dealt with the pandemic in the same way as his government. Reflecting on his Covid battle two years ago, Mr Johnson said he spent his time in hospital "worrying that everything was going OK". He added: "And of course, when I came out, I found that everybody had done everything that I wanted to do and they'd done a brilliant job."
