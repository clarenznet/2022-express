The failure of London and Brussels negotiators to come to an agreement over the Northern Ireland Protocol could see the devolved Northern Irish Government fall into the hands of Irish republican and democratic socialist party Sinn Fein, it's been claimed. The Northern Ireland Protocol was introduced in 2021 and requires checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, to meet EU standards. The protocol has been a significant cause of dispute between the UK and the EU, and Northern Ireland’s First Minister Paul Givan even resigned as part of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protests against it.  Mark Francois, a member of the eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) and MP for Rayleigh and Wickford said: “The EU is playing with fire with these negotiations. “Our own ministers [also] need to seriously raise their game and highlight the risks involved.” He continued: “The ERG has been warning Number 10 about the lack of progress on the Protocol for over a year. “If nothing is done very soon, we will probably see Sinn Fein taking control of the devolved Government of Northern Ireland within six weeks.” Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill told Sky News nationalists “are closer than we ever have been [to a united Ireland]”. She added if Brexit “has taught us anything”, it is that the UK Government does not prioritise the people of Northern Ireland.
