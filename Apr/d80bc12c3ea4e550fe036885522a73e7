After a two year delay, Queen and Adam Lambert are gearing up to finally set off on their UK and European tour. The string of concerts kicks off in a month’s time in Belfast on May 27 and now the trio is giving fans around the world the chance to win tickets to a show of their choice. Queen and Adam Lambert said in a statement: “Hello friends, We are thrilled to be back on tour again! To celebrate, we're giving YOU a chance to win a VIP trip and premium tickets to a show of YOUR CHOICE! You and your guest will catch the performance from some of the best seats in the house. We’ll take care of your flights and hotel, so you won’t have to worry about a thing. The best part is every entry supports Mercury Phoenix Trust– an organisation founded in memory of Freddie – with the mission of fighting against HIV/AIDS worldwide. Donate $10 or more for a chance to win! If you want to give more, you'll earn even more entries. Freddie was taken from us too young, but there is still time to make a difference and change the destinies of millions around the world. Thanks for your support and good luck!” The winners will also receive an autographed merchandise bundle from Queen and Adam Lambert. The closing date for the competition is just before midnight PST at the end of May 22 and the winner will be drawn the following day. The Sweepstakes is open to those 13 or over and the more you donate the better your chances eg $10 gets you 100 entries but $1000 gets you 10,000 entries. To enter click here.
