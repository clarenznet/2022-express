Nicola Peltz's mum's glamorous wedding transformation has been revealed after she went "missing" from pictures at her daughter's wedding to Brooklyn Beckham last weekend. Nicola, 27 and Brooklyn, 22, were married in a lavish ceremony that cost a rumoured £3.5 million and saw Hollywood's biggest stars descend to watch the nuptials. While Brooklyn's parents, David and Victoria shared snaps from the event, not much was seen from the Peltz family. The glitzy day was well documented by the Beckham clan and the event itself was snapped by fashion mag Vogue. But now the role Nicola's mother played on her daughter's big day has been revealed by her make-up artist. Claudia's make-up artist took to Instagram to share a stunning snap of the mother of the bride ahead of the nuptials. @nikki_makeup told her 1.8 million followers: "The most beautiful Mother of the Bride, Mrs Claudia Peltz," she wrote with a blue heart.
