The couple sold their current house in Slough and opted for a custom-built house in Oxfordshire. The custom-built kit house is made entirely off site and arrived in the UK ready to assemble, "slotting together in a matter of days". The house arrived from Poland and it was built in England in just a couple of days. Kevin McCloud described the property as "glorious" and "beautiful". However, Grand Designs' viewers didn't seem to like the design and many took to social media to comment on the unusual property.

Another one, @DaveyBoi73, said: "Half a mil and your house turns up on the back of a lorry. "Think I'd prefer more of a hands-on approach." @lolarr16 commented: "If I were spending that much on a house I would want more outside space.  "All the houses seem very close to each other, with not much garden." Dariusz Ski agreed: "Argh, so close to other homes. "If I had the option I'd rather everything was further apart from any neighbour than spend money on the house." Kevin McCloud also followed Vineet and Simmi, who had £625,000 to build a "warm fortress" against the British weather. The couple used a method called insulated concrete formwork to achieve this. Vineet and Simmi's self-build home is "eccentric, vibrant and larger than life," Kevin said. The house needed an expensive lighting system and the couple said they wouldn't move in without the TV they wanted, which cost £8,000. Twitter user Dariusz Ski said: "£25k just to have a system that allows control of the lights in any room. "Get up and use the light switch you lazy git! "85 inch TV? "Insane," the viewer added.
