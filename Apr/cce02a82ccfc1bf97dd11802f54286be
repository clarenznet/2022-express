The four, hour-long documentaries are described as "intimate portraits" of Sir Mick Jagger, 78, Keith Richards, 78, Ronnie Wood, 74, and the late Charlie Watts. Producers were given "unrivalled access and new interviews" with the group. The story of drummer Charlie, who died in August last year aged 80, will be told via tributes from other band members, musical peers and fans, along with archive interview footage. Each film will also screen previously unseen footage, exclusive stories, as well as new performance footage and some from the archive vaults. And there will be interviews with Chrissie Hynde, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash, Sir Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and others. Called My Life As A Rolling Stone, and produced by Mercury Studios, the series will premiere on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer in the summer.  In addition, a collection of concerts and documentaries on Stones will be made available on iPlayer in the summer. A world exclusive, two-hour audio documentary, called Rolling With The Stones, will be broadcast on Radio 2. The Rolling Stones' manager, Joyce Smyth, said: "We are thrilled to celebrate 60 years of The Rolling Stones with these four films which give fans around the world a new and fascinating look at the band." The Stones are embarking on their Sixty tour this summer, which will consist of 14 shows in 10 countries across Europe, starting on June 1 in Madrid and taking in Liverpool and London.
