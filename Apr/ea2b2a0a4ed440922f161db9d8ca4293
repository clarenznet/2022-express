The Portuguese ace and his partner Georgina Rodriguez confirmed the heartbreaking news on Monday, describing their newborn baby boy as an “angel” while adding that the tragic infant’s twin sister was giving them "strength" through the emotional pain. Ronaldo was given compassionate leave to miss United’s trip to Liverpool on Tuesday night which ended in a 4-0 defeat, but this morning was driven into the club's Carrington complex. United said in a statement ahead of the Liverpool game: “Family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time.” Ronaldo and Georgina revealed the tragic loss in a joint statement which was posted on social media on Monday evening.  It read: "It is with our deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our baby boy. It's the greatest pain any parent can feel. Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. "We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you."
