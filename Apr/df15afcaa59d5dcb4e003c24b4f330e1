The Government is attempting to tackle the varying reliability of the UK’s charging network. And now, under a new law coming in later this year, the country’s electric vehicle rapid charging network will be required to have a 99 percent reliability rate. Ministers hope that the new law will eradicate range anxiety and create a “world-class” charging grid. The legislation also includes a £1.6billion investment in 300,000 new charge points across the country. If that comes to fruition, the UK will have five times as many traditional fuel pumps currently in operation. A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesperson said: “We’ve committed £1.6billion to support the rollout of charge points across the UK and, as part of our recently published EV Infrastructure Strategy, we will set new legal requirements to improve reliability at public charge points.” READ MORE: Furious taxi driver fined £2,700 for smashing airport ticket machine They added that the accessibility of charging devices is also a priority. “We recently consulted on ensuring that charge points are inclusively designed and will publish our response later this year,” the spokesperson told Autocar. Earlier this week, it was shown the number of EV public chargers in the UK has risen by 33 percent, with 30,290 now in operation. The data, which was sourced by a mapping provider Zap-Map and published by the DfT, showed around 7500 new devices have been installed in the past year.

The figures also showed that London has the most chargers, with 111 per 100,000 people. The least in the UK was found to be the entire country of Northern Ireland, which has just 18 per 100,000. On average across the UK, there are 45 public chargers per 100,000 people. The research also found what percentage of those were rapid chargers, with Scotland recording 13.6 per 100,000, and Northern Ireland just 1.3. On a more local level, the northwest of England has 5.9 per 100,000, while the northeast has 9.4. EV uptake is expected to continue rising exponentially as the 2030 ban on new combustion car sales looms. The figures show the Government, as well as charging point companies, are reacting to this. At this point in 2015, there were only around 2000 devices in operation, rising to 10,000 in 2018. The news comes after it was revealed that EV drivers could charge their vehicles for free with a fifth of UK's EV charging points still free to use. The figure provided by Zap-Map showed last year there were 25,000 charging devices listed on their service, and almost 5,350 were free to use. In Northern Ireland, 70 percent of the charge points are free, thanks to the national network ecarNI. Similarly, 1,000 of the 1,400 EV chargers from Government-backed operator ChargePlace Scotland do not require a fee. On top of that, motorists can drive to one of the National Trust properties equipped with EV charge points to receive a top-up in a reverse donation from the charity. Many supermarket chains also provide free EV chargers. And on some dealer forecourts, drivers will not pay a penny for recharging a brand-specific electric car.
