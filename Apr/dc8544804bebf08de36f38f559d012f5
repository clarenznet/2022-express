The region is the engine room of the future. It is already producing the next generation of economic superpowers and tech start-ups – with Indonesia leading the way. Indonesia is one of the world’s largest economies, with this powerhouse of the Indo-Pacific only going from strength to strength over the coming decades. It will be the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050 and is already producing a string of success stories in the industries of the future. I saw that for myself in Jakarta, seeing the growth of tech company GoJek, who are worth over ten billion dollars. I want to position Britain where the future growth is, so I am proud to launch our new UK-Indonesia roadmap, which will turbocharge our cooperation like never before.  This is fundamentally a win-win. It means delivering jobs and opportunities for the British people in the industries of the future across our country like electric cars and green technology. In this more dangerous world, we will also show the strength of our security ties with new defence cooperation, joint training and jungle warfare exercises with the British Army in the pipeline. We will also step up to face down new and emerging threats with greater cooperation in cybersecurity. This is Global Britain in action: deepening ties with fellow freedom-loving democracies to build a network of liberty. Together with allies like Indonesia, we will secure a brighter, safer and more peaceful world.
