The huge fire raged in Bellingham, Catford, although is now under control by emergency services. A video posted on social media depicted an enormous plume of smoke coming from the blaze, with the witness describing it as a "massive fire". Other witnesses reported being able to see the smoke from Blythe Hill Park and Beckenham Place Park - well over a mile away from the site of the fire. Witness Emma Shaw said: "I can see it from Blythe hill park too. Lots of smoke. Hopefully not as bad as it looks." The London Fire Brigade confirmed emergency services are at the scene. They tweeted: "Eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters are attending a fire in Randlesdown Road." This number was later increased to twelve fire engines and 80 firefighters. Thameslink have stated that no services can currently call at Bellingham station "due to a fire near Railway property". The A21 Bormley Road is also reportedly closed in both directions.
