Royal Mail unveiled the tributes to the unsung heroes which illustrate the huge range of work millions of women tackled. One stamp features a rare photo of female codebreakers working at Bletchley Park, where their duties included translation, analysis and operating the complex cryptographic machinery. Four others showcase the work of the Ferry Pilots of the Air Transport Auxiliary, known as the "Spitfire Women", a brave band of pilots. David Gold, the director of external affairs and policy at Royal Mail, said: "These stamps are a tribute to the millions of women who contributed to the war effort and the Allied victory." The stamps will be available on general sale from next Thursday. The presentation pack of all the stamps is priced at Â£16.
