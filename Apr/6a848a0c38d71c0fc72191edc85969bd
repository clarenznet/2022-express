Following Brexit, British holidaymakers travelling to the EU are no longer able to zip through speedy passport e-gates but instead have to wait in long lines for passports to be manually checked. However, Portugal has become the first major EU country to break protocol and to treat British citizens broadly the same as EU citizens. Britons are now allowed to pass through the e-gates when arriving in Portugal - although they still have to get passports stamped in a separate queue. With EU countries relying heavily on British tourism this summer, Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency believes that other countries could follow suit. He said: "Portugal is clearly leading the way in recognising that they have to process vast numbers of British visitors as seamlessly as possible otherwise there would be long queues this summer. "I think you will see other EU countries follow this approach otherwise British travellers will face long delays going into France, Spain, Greece, Italy and other countries."
