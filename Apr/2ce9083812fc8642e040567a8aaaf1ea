Illia Ponomarenko,Â Defense reporter with The Kyiv Independent, has said that Russian military presence northwest, west, and east of Kyiv has "just ceased to exist." He tweeted a map and said: "The Ukrainian forces have regained control of all key points, including Borodyanka and Ivankiv, Ukrainian forces are cleaning up Bucha, Vorzel and Hostomel." Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg does not think Russian forces are withdrawing but regrouping and Ukrainian officials say Russian troops are losing ground rather than retreating of their own accord. Many fear that fighting having abated in Kyiv, may mean eastern Ukraine's Donbas region could become the focus of the war in coming weeks. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES....
