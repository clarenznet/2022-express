Petru-Sorin Doleanu, 41, was chatting with two friends in the street when he was approached and attacked by the mystery man. He became unwell the following day and was taken to hospital with a significant brain injury. But his condition worsened and he died from the injury and pneumonia on March 29.  Detectives have now released CCTV taken near the scene in Wembley, North London, of a man they want to trace. Detective Inspector Jack Stilwell also appealed for information about the attack, which happened just before 9pm on December 17. He said: "The past few months have been extremely challenging for Petru-Sorin's family and friends. While it has been clear for some time that his injuries were extensive, his death has understandably been very difficult for them to come to terms with." Detailing the attack, he added: "Petru-Sorin was with two friends near the Jobcentre in St John's Road, Wembley. They were approached by an unknown male.  "There was an altercation and Petru-Sorin was assaulted, sustaining the injuries that led to him being hospitalised the following day." Det Insp Stilwell said: "We have carried out extensive inquiries and have released a CCTV image of a man we want to speak to. "I urge anyone who recognises the man in the picture to come forward." Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
