Putin has unleashed a successful test of the lethal ‘Satan II’ nuclear missile, but despite its horrifying name an intelligence expert has branded the move as "weak". Justin Crump, of Sibylline, an intelligence and geopolitical risk firm, told The Telegraph: "The fact is that nuclear rhetoric is actually more or less the last weapon left in the Kremlin's arsenal right now, so in other ways this latest test is in fact a further sign of weakness." Jim Townsend, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for America's European and Nato policy, suggested the move is the Kremlin trying to signal that "they're big and bad." When really, "it's a sign of their frustration, a sign of their insecurity." In a sure sign of weakness, Bellingcat, the investigative website, has revealed that 3,000 Wagner mercenary members of the private military company (PMC) are thought to have been killed on the battlefield.
