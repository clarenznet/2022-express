Lloyd, 59, who is an MBE, admitted three charges of possessing indecent images of a child – 48 in the most serious category. Prosecutor Keith Ballinger said Wiltshire Police arrested Lloyd at his home in Crudwell, near Malmesbury, last February. Analysis of items including his laptop revealed indecent pictures and videos of children. Lloyd, who now lives in Windsor, Berks, was told he must register as a sex offender within 72 hours. He is due to be sentenced at Swindon Crown Court on May 6. Lloyd, known in the RAF as Andy “Cubes” Cubin, had appeared as an expert witness in the trial of Shoreham air show crash pilot Andrew Hill. In 2016, he told how he and his wife battled in vain to save their 14-year-old daughter, who died suddenly on a sleepover.
