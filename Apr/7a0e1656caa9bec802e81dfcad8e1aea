Russell Marsh, 29, was told he must serve a minimum of 25 years for the "remarkably cruel" murder of Co-op worker Jade, 27. Marsh showed no emotion at the sentence, but the public gallery burst into applause and someone shouted: "Rot in hell!" as he was led to the cells at Mold Crown Court, North Wales.  The court heard, biomass plant worker Marsh entered Jade's home in Shotton, Flintshire, in the early hours last August, and repeatedly slashed and stabbed her before killing her. Days before the murder, Jade shared a first kiss with a friend and Marsh had either witnessed or heard about it, the jury was told. On the night of the murder, Jade had ignored his texts and attempts to speak to her. Marsh earlier admitted manslaughter but was convicted of murder.  Judge Rhys Rowlands described Marsh, of Shotton, as dangerous and "consumed" with self-pity and jealousy. He said he showed "absolutely no remorse for the dreadful violence inflicted upon Jade". In a victim impact statement read to the court, Jade's brother, Kyle Robinson, said: "Jade always saw the good in people but sadly her good heart and ability to forgive led to her death." Outside court, Jade's mother, Karen Robinson, called her an "amazing mum". She added: "There are no words that can explain how broken we all are."
