The Duchess of Sussex has applied to trademark the word "archetypes", the name of her first podcast for Spotify which is due to be released more than 18 months after signing the lucrative £18million deal. But Meghan may be too late to claim the word which derives from ancient Greek and first entered into English usage around the 1540s. She made the application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office last month but could face legal challenges from companies that use the word in their names, such as the skincare and cleaning products business Archetypes, which has already established a trademark. The 'Archetypes’ podcast will be hosted by Meghan who will speak to historians, experts and woman who have experienced being typecast. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
