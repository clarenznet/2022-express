Obsessive stranger Toraq Wyngard, 64, set the fire in a skip outside the ex-Coronation Street actress's house. Denise, 63, was alerted by husband Lincoln Townley's "piercing scream" after a member of the public saw the flames and knocked on their door. The fire, in September 2020, caused Â£4,285 of damage when it spread to the garage attached to their home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Denise told Judge Michael Leeming: "It has changed my life. I have a wonderful life and this man has permanently scarred it." Speaking from the US via video link, she added: "I have not been the same relaxed, carefree person I was before. I'm constantly on my guard, petrified he will jump out at me. Knife "Everything I do is overshadowed by what could happen if this man is allowed to come near me in future." Cheshire Crown Court heard CCTV captured a man in a badge-covered cap appearing to pour an accelerant into the skip before setting it alight. Wyngard, of Salford, Greater Manchester, was arrested nearby wearing the cap - and police found a four-inch kitchen knife in his bag. In February 2021, while he was under investigation, Denise and Lincoln found the words "Witch" and "Pimp" and an upside-down cross scrawled on their gate. CCTV showed Wyngard was the culprit. He admitted stalking, causing serious alarm or distress, possession of a knife, criminal damage and arson. Wyngard was jailed for seven years and seven months and made the subject of a restraining order, banning him from Wilmslow. Sentencing was delayed after he claimed he was "pressured" into admitting the offences, but his bid to change his pleas was rejected.
