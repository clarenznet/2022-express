Ahead of the April 10 first-round of voting for the French Presidential election, Mr Macron has been more critical of the EU and called for more powers to return to Brussels. When asked by Express.co.uk about the French President, Tory MP Mark Francois said: “President Macron is facing re-election in the next few weeks and we should probably view many of his recent statements in that light. “That said, he is personally committed to an increasingly Federalised EU, which may yet evolve over the next few years. “If the EU really does try to become a Federal state, in which individual nations are completely subsumed, that would only serve to underline that the ERG and the wider Brexiteer movement were right all along.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE BREXIT UPDATES:
