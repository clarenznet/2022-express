Arsenal have confirmed Thomas Partey has suffered muscle damage to his right thigh. A statement from the Gunners did not put an expected timescale on Partey's absence in an ominous update on the 28-year-old. However, the club said he would be assessed over the coming weeks, hinting he will at least miss a number of matches. Partey injured his thigh last season during the north London derby loss at Tottenham. He spent over a month out of the team on that occasion. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta confirmed on Monday it appeared to be a recurrence of a previous injury for the Ghana international, so he could face a similar length of time out again. The statement reads: "Our No. 5 was substituted during Monday night’s game against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after aggravating his right thigh. Thomas has since received further assessments, and a subsequent scan has shown muscle damage to his right thigh.

Everyone will be working hard to get Thomas back on the pitch as soon as possible." Partey limped off in the second half of the 3-0 defeat at Palace. After the game, Arteta said: "I don’t know, but he felt something in the same area that he got injured previously, so it’s a big concern." Partey looks set to at least miss Saturday's visit of Brighton to the Emirates. Arsenal then face a trip to Southampton the following weekend. They then play away at Chelsea, host Manchester United and travel to West Ham in the space of 11 days. Partey's absence will be a huge blow to the Gunners' chances of gaining Champions League qualification for the first time since 2016.
