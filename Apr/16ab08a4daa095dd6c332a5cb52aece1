It promised to be the showbiz wedding of the decade, with a star-studded guestlist including Gordon Ramsay, Eva Longoria, Mel C and tennis legend Serena Williams - and it didn't disappoint. It even featured little Harper Beckham as flower girl. Brooklyn's mum Victoria Beckham made a dramatic entrance in a sparkling silver sequined gown similar in style to the ones Paris Hilton and Kendall Jenner wore at their 21st birthday bashes, but re-adapted into a long and sweeping gown. She and David Beckham held hands tenderly, with David donning a smart black suit. Brooklyn reportedly sat alone on the stage for 15 minutes at the Peltz family's Â£76 million Florida beachside mansion before the bride-to-be made her dramatic entrance. They married beneath a flower garlanded chuppah in celebration of Nicola's Jewish heritage. Brooklyn shares some of his wife's Jewish roots via father David's paternal grandfather. Not all of the Spice Girls were present, and Emma Bunton cancelled her attendance via Instagram with just hours to go before the big day. Meanwhile Geri Horner had obligations in Australia with her Formula 1 driver husband Christian Horner, making Mel C the only Spice Girl spotted during the star-studded nuptials. Though Prince William and Kate Middleton were reportedly invited, they did not attend the event and Elton John, Beckham's god-father was also absent. Brooklyn was flanked by six groomsmen, while Nicola was assisted by six maids of honour. The youngest member of the Beckham family, Victoria's adorable ten-year-old daughter Harper, also attended the event as a bridesmaid, clad in an angelic white dress and wearing a flower crown atop her head. Meanwhile Brooklyn's younger brother Cruz posed as best man on the day. In the most poignant moment of the day, the bride and groom kissed for six seconds while the admiring crowd looked on.
