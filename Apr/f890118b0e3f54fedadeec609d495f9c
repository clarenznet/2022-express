  Jon looked ready to tee up in a pair of light grey trousers and white trainers. He paired the look with a dark blue and grey polo shirt and matching cap. Kelley looked stylish in an all-white tracksuit and matching white trainers. The glamorous mum wore her blonde locks in gentle waves that fell past her shoulders.  Jon held baby Kepa in his arms as he smiled proudly at the camera. Kepa wore a white matching outfit, like his mum, and a pair of little green and white trainers on his feet. Jon and Kelley welcomed Kepa, who is their first child, last April. Now the couple are expecting another boy this summer, after announcing the exciting news on social media earlier this year.
