Jurors at Wolverhampton Crown Court found James Davis, 35, guilty of causing the death of two-week-old Ciaran Morris by dangerous driving while uninsured.  Davis said he blacked out and could not remember hitting Ciaran's pram near Walsall, on Easter Sunday last year. Judge John Butterfield QC said Davis had not attempted to brake. Told that Davis's mobile was hidden from police for more than two months, the judge told him: "As you drove you allowed yourself to be avoidably distracted."
