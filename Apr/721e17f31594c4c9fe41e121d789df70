Simon, 62, has now hit back at David's jibes about his looks by cheekily suggesting he's had a hair transplant. While comedian David insists the one thing that hasn't changed in the past decade his ability to wind the music mogul with his jokey personal comments. The squabbling duo are back on our screens tonight, with the new series of BGT in full chaotic flow. Among the acts auditioning are escape artist Andrew Basso, who will immerse himself in a water tank, and karate expert Hammerhand, who smashes coconuts with his bare hands. This is the 10th year the show has featured the same line-up of judges, with Simon and David, right, joined stars Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden. Asked how they have all changed over the decade, Simon said: "Actually, everyone seems to look identical to when we started. David seems to have more hair, funny that! Maybe he's got a new hairdresser!" David, 50, said: "Every single day when someone recognises me on the street, they say, 'Oh, we love it when you have a go at Simon.' "It seems to be the key thing that people really like about the show, and so if I didn't give him a hard time, I think people would be disappointed. But I do give him a hard time, because he doesn't often listen to the contestants. I think otherwise he can just be Mr Grumpy. I think with me he can be a more playful. "I think he likes being teased, because it makes him the centre of attention. That's his one goal."  Fellow judge Alesha added: "The fact that we're still going strong after 10 years is really something special and worth celebrating. We've always felt like this kind of dysfunctional TV family." Tonight's auditions promise plenty of drama. Escapologist Basso is known for his death-defying acts, and will perform a routine where he is handcuffed and chained inside a tank full of water. Also appearing are impressionist Suzy Wilde and dance group Pocket Rockets. Britain's Got Talent is on ITV tonight at 8pm.
