This revival is complete with music by flamenco popularisers The Gipsy Kings, played live on stage by a rollicking band of actor/musicians. Set in early 19th Century California which was under Spanish rule, it is the story of Don Diego de la Vega (Benjamin Purkiss) and his older brother Ramon (Alex Gibson-Giorgio). When Diego is sent to Spain to prepare himself for political office, his jealous brother Ramon makes himself dictator following their father’s apparent death. The woman they both love, Luisa (Paige Fenlon) goes in search of Diego to bring him back to sort things out but finds he has abandoned his studies for the life of a party-loving vagabond. Along with his band of gypsies he returns and becomes the masked avenger Zorro to right wrongs and dispense justice at the point of his sword. It’s all great Boys’ Own stuff, pumped up with primitive flamenco dancing and Spaghetti Western styling. The songs are competently sung by the enthusiastic cast, of whom the Carmen-esque sexpot Inez (Phoebe Panaretos) and hapless, lovelorn Sergeant Garcia (Marc Pickering) shine out. The small stage with the audience ranged on either side seems cramped - careful with that flaming sword, Don Diego! - but doesn’t inhibit the hip-swirling, arm-flinging, blade-wielding antics. The central dance of women lamenting their lot is powerfully executed. Loose though it is, there is much fun to be had from the camp antics in this raucous, barnstorming production.
