West Ham wasted no time in mocking Lyon forward Moussa Dembele following the Hammers' Europa League semi-final win. West Ham shocked the French side in a 3-0 drubbing on Thursday night. Dembele and Lyon had a night to forget as the Hammers stormed into the final four of the Europa League. Craig Dawson, Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen scored as the Premier League side set up a tie against Eintracht Frankfurt. French striker Dembele had enraged West Ham fans in the first leg, after he winked at the camera having been fouled by Aaron Cresswell - who was sent off. The forward's action went viral on social media, but it was the Hammers who had the last laugh with a post of their own. Just minutes after the full-time whistle in Lyon, the official West Ham Twitter account posted a video of Dembele winking - this time in black and white with the words "hello darkness, my old friend" being sung over the top. They posted the video along with the winking emoji, a not-so-subtle nod to the original clip. And it wasn't just the Twitter admin who had remembered Dembele's taunting. Speaking after Thursday's game, goalscorer Rice admitted he and his team-mates hadn't forgotten Dembele's winking. He said: There were a few incentives tonight for us to go out and win. Dembele winking in the first leg and their Twitter admin saying they don’t see how they don’t go through and those things come back to bite you." West Ham will now face German side Eintracht Frankfurt in the semi-finals after the Bundesliga side's emphatic 3-2 win over Barcelona at the Nou Camp. And Rice insisted he and his team-mates will have to be on top form. He said: "For them to beat Barca they’re a top side. Whether it was a poor night from Barca, they still had to score three against them. We saw them against Betis and they looked a real strong side."
