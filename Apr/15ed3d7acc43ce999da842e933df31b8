The Grid’s annual assessment of Britain's resilience to disruption to electricity supplies showed the amount of reserve electricity supply that could be called upon was expected to be 6.6 percent of demand but could fall as low as 4.2 percent. While it said it believed there was enough slack in the system to avoid blackouts, conditions had worsened since an earlier prediction in July.

Knocked out computer networks and activated emergency electricity supplies forced staff at several banks to work from home. Several banks relied on auxiliary generators to keep their trading teams on site. Meanwhile, a fire at an electrical substation on Castor Lane in Poplar, east London, caused significant disruption to the electricity supply across that part of the capital on Tuesday last week. Station Commander Colin Digby, who was at the scene, said in a statement: "Firefighters have worked hard in challenging conditions to tackle the substation blaze. A small amount remains alight and it is likely that fire crews will be here for hours to come. "The fire has caused power outages in the area. Currently, the Limehouse Link Tunnel has reopened fully and the Blackwall Tunnel is opened southbound but still closed Northbound. The Rotherhithe Tunnel remains closed." Fire crews from Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Shadwell and Plaistow stations brought the fire under control. However, around 38,000 customers were estimated to have been temporarily left without power by the incident.
