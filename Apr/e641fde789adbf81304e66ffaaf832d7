Just head to the bottom of the page for help solving today's fairly tricky puzzle. Before we get to the clues, let's quickly go over the rules. In Wordle, players are given six chances to guess a five-letter word. You'll need to use the process of elimination to uncover the correct answer, so pay close attention to the colour of the tiles. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, as well as your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your precious winning streak.
