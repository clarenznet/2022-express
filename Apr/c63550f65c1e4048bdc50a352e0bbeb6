The 31-year-old singersongwriter arrived on Sunday evening without any security at The Roost in Birmingham. He ended up behind the bar - and joked with the manager: "You're paying me."  The Shape Of You singer, joined by rapper pal Jaykae, happily mingled with other punters. Mobile phone footage showed Ed singing No Games, by Serani, with locals as he took part in a pool tournament. Pub manager Ian Connors, 39, said: "We couldn't understand what a megastar like him would be doing in a pub in Small Heath. He was just a gentleman. Really down to earth. "He started pulling a Carling. It was completely surreal." Earlier, Ed ate a curry at Asha's Indian restaurant in the city. General manager Nouman Farooqui, 30, said: "He's probably the nicest celebrity we've catered for - along with Tom Cruise."  Earlier, Ed ate a curry at Asha's Indian restaurant in the city.
