The scene-stealing fuchsia gown was worn by the 63-year-old star in her famous ode to Eighties excess. It is up for grabs alongside her faux fur stole, opera gloves and rhinestone bracelets from the video for the 1984 hit. Madge's satin dress was inspired by Marilyn Monroe's pink outfit in the musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.  It is on sale at Julien's Auctions' Music Icons event at the Hard Rock Cafe New York from May 20 to 22. Grunge genre fans are in for a treat too. The lefthanded 1969 Fender Mustang played by late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in their 1991 Smells Like Teen Spirit video could fetch as much as Â£600,000. Also on sale is a signed Eddie Van Halen Charvel EVH guitar. The auction features more than 1,200 memorabilia related to stars including The Beatles, Queen, Elvis Presley, Lady Gaga, Elton John, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Michael Jackson.
