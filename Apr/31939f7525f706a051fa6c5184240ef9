The 71-year-old star looked sensational as she graced the red carpets at both the Elton John Aids Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party and the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Los Angeles earlier this week.  Jane said: "I am unusual in Hollywood in not having work done. I only know one other actress who hasn't had it - though she might have now! "I felt as an actress I needed to have all the moving parts moving. And I'm at the point in life where it's not all about looking perfect - it's about playing a character." Jane is ditching her glamorous persona for her latest role as a retired academic turned amateur sleuth in Acorn TV's Dublinbased mystery series Harry Wild, which begins on Monday. She added: "I'm playing someone who's not about the way she looks but the way she thinks."  Born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, but now based in Malibu, California Jane became an overnight star in 1973 as the psychic Solitaire opposite Roger Moore in the Bond film Live And Let Die. She became a US household name in 1993 as the title character in the TV hit Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman.
