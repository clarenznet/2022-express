The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit The Firm in 2020, but Princess Diana's biographer Tina Brown claims it didn't have the outcome they were expecting. In her new book about the Royal Family she quotes an insider claiming "They thought it would force the Royal Family to respond by saying… ‘OK, Harry and Meghan, what do you want?
