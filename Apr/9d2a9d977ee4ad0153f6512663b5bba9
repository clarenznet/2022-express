Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle made a surprise stop-off in the UK en route to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to Windsor where they met Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and later the Queen. Their visit came just weeks after the couple missed Prince Philip’s Service of Thanksgiving. While a reason for their absence was not given, the Duke is currently in a legal battle with the Home Office over police protection for his family while in the UK.The prince has previously said he “does not feel safe” bringing his children to his home country without said protection.Harry cited the same issues in an interview with NBC’s Hoda Kotb during the Invictus Games.When Ms Kotb asked whether he was planning to visit the UK for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, Harry said that he did not yet know. He said: “I don't know yet. There's lots of things: security issues and everything else.“So this is what I'm trying to do, trying to make it possible that, you know, I can get my kids to meet her.”Harry’s son, Archie, has not returned to the UK since the exit, while Lilibet, the Sussexes’ daughter, has never visited her father’s home country.Russell Myers, the Daily Mirror’s royal editor, told Thursday’s episode of Pod Save The Queen that Harry may already have plans to come over the Jubilee celebrations. Mr Myers said: “He said he didn’t know whether he was going to come over for the Jubilee and he was citing issues such as security and everything else.“My understanding is that his aides are already making plans for him to come over, whether that will be with Meghan and the children remains to be seen but Harry said himself that he wanted to create an opportunity to get the issues sorted out so that his children could see the Queen.”Harry spoke fondly of his reunion with his grandmother, saying the monarch was in “great form” and it was “nice to see her”.Following their meeting, Meghan and Harry were reportedly invited to join the Royal Family during the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in non-formal roles.

I think that it suits their purpose brand-wise to be seen with the Queen, to be seen to still be royal.” He added: “They can argue that — I mean Meghan was saying — this is service. “That was seen as a barbed comment as well to the rest of the Royal Family, but I think they benefit from having that association because on a global scale, seeming to do their own thing but also having an association with the Royal Family gives them credence.”Initially, Meghan and Harry wanted to make their roles in the Royal Family more “progressive”, by pursuing outside avenues while also representing the Queen.According to the Sussex Royal website, Meghan and Harry wanted “to continue to represent and support Her Majesty The Queen,” while having “their own income and the ability to pursue their own private charitable interests.” But this plan was rejected, and the Sussexes have since spent most of their time in the US.The upcoming Platinum Jubilee provides Meghan and Harry with the perfect opportunity to reunite with the family, and for the Queen and Prince Charles to finally meet Lilibet.
