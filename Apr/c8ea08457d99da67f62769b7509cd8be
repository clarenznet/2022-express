Now, after briefly visiting his grandmother, the Queen, he claims that he returned to the UK to make sure Her Majesty is "protected" and "has the right people around her". His grandmother needed that support when her husband was ill, and then after he passed, not months and months later, and while Netflix are following him. Forty years ago we held aVE Day celebration - 200 people attended, all dressed in British uniforms, says Peter Lomas, from Oldham, Greater Manchester. Our local fancy dress shop ran out of British uniforms but had two Luftwaffe ones. So I hired them for a friend and myself.We entered the hall on the night waving white flags and we were good-naturedly booed. It was done as a joke and accepted as one. Does the current woke climate mean I should now do the decent thing and resign from our parochial church council? I was sorry to read that Liam Gallagher was an arthritis sufferer but intrigued that he gets relief from "herbal sleeping tablets", says Christopher Ashton, from Lutterworth, Leics. This puts me in the unusual position of actually considering taking drug advice from a rock star. Providing the drugs are legal I would love to know what they are, so all of us suffering with arthritis can benefit from them. WHY are we funding all these projects, says Pauline Simpson, from Stafford. The rich in India and Pakistan do not help the poor, India has a space programme and they both have nuclear weapons. The money could be used here to build hospitals and employ more nurses and doctors because of the increased population. Charity should start in this country first. Enough is enough. Boris messed up and apologised so leave it alone, says Valerie Lingard, from Hale, Cheshire. Partygate happened ages ago and there are far more important issues that need his attention. Besides, who do these people think would take his place? There is nobody else capable of doing his job.
