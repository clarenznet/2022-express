      Aljaz, 32, shared the photograph of the Strictly: It Takes Two host with his 545,000 Instagram followers. The star bared all in just a skimpy pair of pink bikini bottoms as she emerged from the clear blue ocean with her arms over her chest to protect her modesty. Janette looked fresh-faced and makeup-free in the pic as she glanced back at the shore. After five years of marriage, the pair have proved they are still both very much in love.  Aljaz captioned the photo: “Looking for a mermaid? I found mine…” While Janette responded: “And I found my shipwreck Prince. Love you.” This is not the first time the pair have shared an intimate picture online, as Janette previously shared a topless photo of them both holding each other close for Valentine’s Day. Aljaz announced his exit from Strictly Come Dancing in March, while Janette left the show as a professional dancer the year before to take up her new presenting role.
