A Western official described Moscow's operations in Ukraine as "disastrous", saying the abandonment of "a lot" of equipment could be hinting at a "collapse of the will to fight" a war launched by Putin over six weeks ago. The unnamed official told a news conference: "We can confirm that there are no longer units in northern Ukraine. "It has been a pretty hasty withdrawal by Russian forces and there's a lot of Russian equipment which has been abandoned in that hasty withdrawal and that's only going to exacerbate the challenge they have in terms of the refurbishment and reconstitution of their forces as they remove them both into Belarus and into Russia. "Some of it is kind of unclear as to why it's been abandoned because you might have thought there is some of these vehicles are still usable and you think they would have been able to take and I think there's something around the collapse of morale and the collapse of the will to fight." The remarks come amid obvious difficulties on the Kremlin's end to seize any major Ukrainian cities. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
