French luxury kitchenware company Le Creuset has written to customers urging them to use an alternative with a higher smoke point. One customer who complained about their non-stick wok was told: “We advise to avoid using olive oil and recommend oils with a higher burning point like rapeseed oil, coconut oil and sunflower oil. “Olive oil has a very low burning point, and this can form a brownish film on the pan (burnt oil), creating a barrier between food and the pan. “We would advise that every now and then you rub cooking oil around the pan and leave it, this will help preserve the quality of it.” John Lewis issued similar advice. The store giant said: “We advise customers that olive oil can carbonise on ceramic pans, leaving a residue.” Chef Mark Greenaway said olive oil should be used as a drizzle and garnish. He said: “You should never cook with olive oil. It should only ever be used in finishing a dish. “It removes the Teflon from non-stick or ‘burns’ traditional pans.” Unrefined oils have a lower smoke point as they contain more minerals, enzymes and other compounds. Oils with a higher smoke point include avocado, almond, canola, corn and peanut oil.
