Jonathan Rolande, property expert and founder of the National Association of Property Buyers, said: "The British seaside has had a post-lockdown renaissance as many work from home permanently or simply reassess their priorities and work/ life balance.  "The idea of peaceful paddle boarding, beach barbecues and fresh air tempts any a city dweller. Prices have jumped accordingly."
