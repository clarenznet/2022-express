Emergency services attended the incident which saw a lorry smash into the central reserve. Work is being carried out to repair barrier damage and clear debris. Motorists have been warned to expect delays and allow extra time for journeys. A diversion is in place. A National Highways spokesperson said: "National Highways is advising drivers to plan ahead and allow extra time for their journeys following an incident earlier this morning which has closed the M4 between junction 15 (Marlborough, Swindon East) and junction 16 (Swindon West). "An incident involving two HGVS occurred on the westbound carriageway around 3am, causing damage to an extensive section of the central reservation barrier. "Both eastbound and westbound carriageways were initially closed, westbound remains closed for police investigations and lanes 2 and 3 eastbound are currently closed past the scene due to barrier damage and debris. "Westbound traffic is currently being diverted via junction 15, following a hollow triangle along the A419, A4259, B4289, B4006 and A3012 to rejoin the M4 at junction 16. "National Highwaysâ€™ teams are currently repairing a 50-metre section of barrier and clearing debris while Wiltshire Police carry out investigations, and the westbound carriageway is anticipated to be closed for most of the morning. "In the meantime, drivers are urged to allow extra journey time and plan ahead as delays are likely on the approach to the closure." In a tweet just after 10am, National Highways said: "The #M4 remains closed westbound between J15 and J16 near #Swindon following a collision. "Two lanes (of 3 lanes) are closed eastbound. "Work to repair a significant amount of barrier damage continues."
