A study for care found six in 10 believe "porn is inspiring sexual violence against women and girls." The research came just weeks after Wayne Couzens - a man obsessed with violent porn - was jailed for life for the rape and murder of Sarah Everard. And it followed a warning by schools' regulator Ofsted that harassment has become "normalised" in schools, citing porn as a major driver of the problem. The public has long known what politicians are beginning to wake up to - that internet pornography is causing untold harm. It is regularly implicated in sexual crimes. Professionals who work with victims are clear about its impact on perpetrators. It is also fuelling poisonous attitudes towards sex amongst children and young people. As someone who has worked for the Children's Commissioner, and led a children's charity, I know its tragic toll. The porn young people access today is very different to that of previous decades. Most of what is viewed today is violent and degrading. Attitudes are shaped. The young see what they witness in porn as acceptable - something they should mimic. Care is campaigning for under-18s to be prevented from stumbling across porn and for sites punished for hosting extreme content. Ministers can see these safeguards achieved through online safety legislation. Porn's harms also require an educational response. This starts with parents, who need to be having frank and honest discussions with their children. We also need to work in media, the arts, pop culture and elsewhere to challenge the objectification of women. We can stem an awful tide of sexual violence. â€¢ Ross Hendry is the CEO of the Christian charity CARE (Christian, Action Research and Education).
