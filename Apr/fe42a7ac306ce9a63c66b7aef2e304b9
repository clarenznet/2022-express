The top seed narrowly escaped defeat againt countryman Miomir Kecmanovic to reach the semi-finals of the Serbia Open, winning through 4-6 6-3 6-3 in two hours and 18 minutes. Djokovic had made it to the quarter-finals after surviving a scare in his opening match, where he was forced to come from a set and a break down to beat Laslo Djere 2-6 7-6(6) 7-6(4). The world No 1 seemed up for it against Kecmanovic as he won the coin toss and elected to serve, managing to open with a service hold after getting broken in his opening game on Wednesday. But the problems started to emerge for the 20-time Grand Slam champion once again as he fired back-to-back drop shot in a poor next service game, getting broken by the world No 38. He was then forced to come back from 0-40 down in the following service game, stopping himself from going a double break down. Djokovic was unable to get back level in the opening set as Kecmanovic served it out 6-4 in 49 minute. The start of the second was a much more even contest between the two countrymen, as the top seed was forced to save a break point in a nine-minute game before the 22-year-old faced two break points in an eight-minute game.
