Victoria Beckham, 48, has shared a new insight into the Beckham household as she took to social media to showcase her outfit. The singer-turned-designer could be seen posing in front of a mirror as husband David sneakily watched on. She was modelling a sultry LBD from her collection while David hid behind a wall to spy on her. The pictures were shared on Friday evening in view of Victoria’s 29.9 million followers. The former Spice Girls star penned: “Someone can't get enough of VB Body @davidbeckham,” alongside a laughing emoji and a side-eye emoji. The elegant dress accentuated Victoria’s slender waist and put her toned legs on display. The pro footballer’s wife opted for a casual hairdo, letting her shoulder-length caramel waves down.
