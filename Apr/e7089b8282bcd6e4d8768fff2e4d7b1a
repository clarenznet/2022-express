Amal Clooney, who is married to George Clooney, showcased her impeccable taste as she put away her smart dresses for a more casual look. The 44-year-old sported a chic ensemble while out with her in Manhattan with her mother Baria Alamuddin yesterday. The human rights lawyer stunned in an eye-catching top that sparkled thanks to the hundreds of silver sequins which decorated the top. She and her mother were spotted as they left their Midtown Manhattan hotel before heading to the West Village for dinner at the upscale steakhouse 4 Charles Prime Rib. The mum-of-two glowed in the sheer silver blouse which appeared almost see-through as she paired the number with jeans. She covered up the playful item with a more sober black double-breasted blazer with short peaked lapels. She elongated her height with a set of pointy silver heels, and she accessorized with a small black handbag. Amal styled her long brunette locks in loose curls as she was all smiles for the cameras. The voluminous hair was swept aside to frame her dangling silver earrings and a splash of crimson on her lips.
