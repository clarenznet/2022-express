The boss ordered employees to clock out each time they use the loo so they won't get paid for this time. The brutal note, posted to a door at the workplace, has now been shared widely on social media, including forum Reddit. The poster reads: "Always clock out when passing this door. Including: bathroom breaks, 10-minute shift breaks, lunch breaks, questions regarding personal requests. "Questions regarding production should not require leaving the production area, please see floor manager on duty. Paid break times will be added to your paycheck in accordance with hours worked." But the backlash was fierce, Birmingham Live reports, with some saying the manager had been unfair.  One Reddit user posted:Â "I worked for an insurance call center and we had to clock out for bathroom breaks - we had six minutes of 'personal time' (unscheduled break time for bathroom use etc) and it was an issue if we consistently went over. The building was MASSIVE and you could easily be stuck with a cubicle that took six minutes just to walk to and from the bathroom alone. Another user wrote: "If you want to buy my body for eight hours, you will pay for its needs, too." A third agreed, writing: "You just read my mind. And I agree if they fire me for just using that bathroom. Then f*** them I'll just ruin there reputation. By telling everyone not to work there anymore. There just on a power trip right now (sic). Another said: "I need water and food to get through a work day. That means I need to get rid of that water and food during the work day as well. Don't like it? Hire a robot."
