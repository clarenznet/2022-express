The newborn baby could have no inkling of what fate had in store for her. Ten years later, following the abdication of her Uncle David, the Duke of Windsor, her father became King George VI and she was heir to his throne. The pony-mad youngster enjoyed a mostly carefree childhood under the watchful eye of protective parents but, by her 21st birthday, she was keenly aware of the path she must follow, pledging herself in a landmark broadcast to the service of her future subjects for her whole life "whether it be long or short". After she became Queen in 1952, in keeping with royal tradition, she celebrated an official birthday in June, and April 21 became a working day like any other.  Sometimes there would be family parties with cake and presents, but for 70 years most birthdays have been spent in the service of her people on state visits, royal tours, inspecting her troops and meeting the public. So today, as the Queen marks her 96th in her Platinum Jubilee year, the Express celebrates with gratitude and admiration nearly 100 years of birthdays. Many happy returns,Your Majesty.
