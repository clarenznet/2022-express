British tourists have faced travel chaos in the last month with passengers from major London airports as well as Manchester affected. Passengers at Manchester airport faced lengthy delays at airport security due to a lack of staff. It can take a very long time for airports to train new security staff due to the amount of clearance needed. Passengers are advised to arrive with plenty of time to make sure that they clear security in time for their flight. Passengers at Dover port and on the roads also faced chaos over the Easter bank holiday weekend. Long queues were reported as Britons rushed to get away for the holiday weekend, the first peak period since restrictions were lifted. British tourists no longer have to take any travel tests or fill out a passenger locator form on return to the UK. Many airlines have also ditched masks on flights although passengers will still need to wear one to travel to certain destinations, including Italy.
