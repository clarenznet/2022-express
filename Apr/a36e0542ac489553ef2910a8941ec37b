Officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG), covering West Midlands Police and the Staffordshire Police force, attended the scene. National Highways warned motorists that delays of 30 minutes were to be expected. The CMPG added that two miles of congestion awaited motorists approaching the junctions. It tweeted: "Traffic is currently stopped on the #M6 southbound between J8 (#M5) and J7 (#Great Barr) due to a @CMPG led incident. "There is currently 2 miles of congestion on approach causing delays of 30 mins above normal travel time." National Highways then warned motorists of further delays to travel via the southbound junctions.

The stretch of the M6 was shut by police after a man tragically fell to his death from a bridge on March 18. The carriageway was off-limits to motorists for most of the day with delays of up to an hour.
