Manchester, Heathrow and Birmingham Airports have all struggled with the start of the Easter holidays. Civil Aviation Authority boss Richard Moriarty said pulled flights and delays risked damaging "confidence".  He told airlines that recruitment "has not always happened sufficiently quickly to cope with the increased passenger travel in recent days". Charlie Cornish, boss of Manchester Airports Group, which also runs London Stansted and East Midlands, said 4,000 people had been interviewed for jobs in just two weeks. But, while apologising for the chaos, he warned problems could persist for another few months.
