Kit Malthouse said his domestic fuel bill was "rising quite significantly", particularly as his rural residence in Hampshire had oil-fired heating. But his remarks provoked a storm of criticism on social media given the 2.7 percent salary increase for MPs comes into force this month. Mr Malthouse's annual remuneration for his backbench and ministerial jobs will soon be Â£115,824. The Policing Minister and Tory MP for North West Hampshire, conducted a series of interviews from his constituency home with a log fire crackling behind him. During an LBC Radio interview, presenter Nick Ferrari asked what was being cut back amid the cost-of-living squeeze. Mr Malthouse replied: "Well, obviously the day-today is quite tricky. As you know, Nick, I've got children, my fuel prices are rising quite significantly." The Resolution Foundation think tank said the number of English households in fuel stress - those spending at least 10 percent of their total budgets on energy bills - was set to double to five million.
