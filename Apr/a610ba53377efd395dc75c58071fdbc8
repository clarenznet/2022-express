Furthermore, the 2020 original was surprisingly not terrible. Even more surprisingly, neither is the follow-up. Wisely, this sequel pushes all the same buttons. Once again, this is a broad family comedy with Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog (very much like Aardman’s Shaun the Sheep) as a well-meaning but manically hyperactive tot learning lessons about empathy and responsibility.  When we catch up with our CGI hero (voiced by Ben Schwartz), he’s playing at being a Spider-man-style crime fighter called The Blue Justice. He foils a bank robbery using his superspeed but ends up wrecking downtown Seattle in the process. Meanwhile, his rubber-faced nemesis Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey) is rescued from his Mushroom Planet exile by an alarmingly muscular, red space hedgehog called Knuckles (Idris Elba) who hates Sonic because of a tribal rivalry on their home planet. Knuckles forms a prickly alliance with Robotnik as they track Sonic to the suburban house he shares with his surrogate human parents (James Marsden and Tika Sumpter).  A third new animated character, a cute flying fox called Tails (Colleen O’Shaughnessey) arrives on Earth to help Sonic (and Paramount Picture’s merchandising department) with an array of quirky gadgets. As the film turns into an Indiana Jones-style treasure hunt for an all-powerful Lord Of The Rings-like trinket, Carrey shouts: ”I don’t want to die like this – it’s so derivative!” The most ambitious element of Sonic 2 may be its running time (a breathless two hours for a kids’ film!) but witty lines and zippy action scenes keep the blue blur on track. In cinemas now.
