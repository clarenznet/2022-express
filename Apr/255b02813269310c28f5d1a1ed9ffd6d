From tulips and roses to wildflowers, staycationers are spoilt for choice when it comes to beautiful spring blooms.  But which flowers can Britons see at each spot?

Regent’s Park in London is the top spot for tulip spotting although Dunham Massey in Cheshire is another great destination for tulips. The spokesperson said: “Roses are the classic go-to flowers for bouquets. But their beauty and delicate scent are even more spectacular if you can appreciate them amidst a serene garden walk.” The best time to see roses in the UK is between March and June, depending on the variety of bloom. According to Bloom and Wild, Grade 1 listed Wrest Park in Bedfordshire is one of the best destinations to see British roses. Threave Garden in Castle Douglas and Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross also made the top spots for British roses.  The spokesperson said: “Daffodils are amongst the first flowers to bloom in springtime and are commonly associated with the end of winter. “These flowers are well-loved by Brits and are featured in most of the top locations on our list.” Stourhead in Wiltshire and Dora’s Field at Rydal Mount and Gardens in Cumbria topped the list for daffodils which are best seen between February and May. There aren’t many sights as beautiful as a forest green covered with bluebells. Britons are most likely to spot bluebells between April and May. Abermawr in Pembrokeshire, Stoneywell in Leicestershire and Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire were named the best spots to see bluebells. Wild orchids are a particularly special sight and although rare, could be spotted at Askrigg Bottoms Meadow in North Yorkshire between May and September. Daisies are easy to find in any wild grassy area but the Pembrokeshire Coast Path has some particularly beautiful varieties. Balranald National Park and Minnowburn in Belfast are also the perfect spots to sight some stunning daisies.
