Drone footage filmed by the Ukrainian military and released on Telegram by Energoatom, the state-owned operator of the country's nuclear power plants, shows Vladimir Putin's forces dug trenches in the area of the site of the deadly 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. According to plant workers, thick radioactive dust kicked up by large Russian vehicles could have been inhaled by Putin's troops. Meanwhile, one soldier went as far as to handle a source of cobalt-60 at a waste storage site with his bare hands, Valeriy Simyonov, the chief safety engineer of the power plant, said. He exposed himself to so much radiation in a few seconds that it went off the scales of a Geiger counter, Mr Simyonov said. It was not clear what happened to the soldier. Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko told CNN on a visit to the zone: "It's crazy, really. "I really have no idea why they did it." Chernobyl fell into the hands of Russian troops in the first week of Moscow's invasion and came back under control of Kyiv last week, on March 31. At least one soldier is said to have died.
