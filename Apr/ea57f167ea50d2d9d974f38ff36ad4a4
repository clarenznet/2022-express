Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side take on Liverpool in the biggest Premier League game of the season on Sunday as they aim to extend their lead at the top of the table in a title six-pointer. Knowing that a loss against the Reds will put them behind Jurgen Klopp's men, the Spaniard has to get his tactics spot on if he is to show his prowess. But having made mistakes before on the big occasion by tinkering his squad - such as the Champions League final loss to Chelsea in May - he will know there is no room for error against the Anfield-based outfit. Express Sport looks at what he must get right in order to prevail victorious. Who will lead the line?City's main weakness - if you could call it that - is who starts up front for them against the Reds.Sergio Aguero's departure in the summer and their subsequent failure to land Harry Kane from Tottenham means that they only have Gabriel Jesus as a recognised striker.The Brazilian has failed to impress so far this season, meaning that Phil Foden, Kevin de Bruyne or Raheem Sterling are likely to be preferred in the false-nine role.However, with all of the aforementioned names better off in other roles, Guardiola must choose carefully who he wants to lead the line.

Who does Pep start on the wings?Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez are all capable of playing at their best on the wings.But with one of them needing to go up front if Kevin de Bruyne is to play at his best in the centre of the park, he must again be frugal in his decisions.Bernardo Silva played excellently in the middle of the park back in the title clash of 2019, meaning he will likely be considered for that role.That leaves three to choose from provided Foden or Sterling start up front.
