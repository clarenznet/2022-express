The luxury motors, including Rolls- Royces, Ferraris and a Lamborghini, were handily lined up for the attendant in a swish London street. One of the Rollers received its third ticket for parking outside the five-star May Fair Hotel, just off Piccadilly.  The mystery owners must now find £130 to settle up - reduced to £65 if they pay within three weeks. But if they drive cars worth up to £300,000 and can lord it up in a £2,500-a-night hotel suite with champagne at £500 a pop, it is unlikely to trouble them. And they will help the local council - Westminster - maintain its record for making the most from parking penalties in the UK. The borough raked in £74million in 2019/2020.
