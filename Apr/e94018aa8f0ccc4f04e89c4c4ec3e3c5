Nick Kyrgios may be digging into his pockets again soon after another of his matches was tainted by continued rows with the umpire. The Australian made it through to the US men's clay court championship semi-final in Houston, where he was beaten by Reilly Opelka 6-3 7-5. An otherwise tense contest was overshadowed by the behaviour of the 26-year-old, who got docked a point for a second audible obscenity at a crucial stage in the second set. With the score at 5-5 and 30-15, Kyrgios was left unhappy by an apparent error from umpire Joshua Brace, who failed to call an Opelka shot out. Then at 30-30, he went into meltdown, making a rash error on the next point, before he was then docked a further point after his second warning for foul language on court. It means he suddenly trailed 6-5, and Opelka then closed out matters to set up a meeting with John Isner in the final. But during the final changeover, the Canberra man had continued to vent his anger, screaming "F***!" as he walked back to his seat. Once sitting down, he then verbally attacked the official again. The Australian Open doubles' champion was fined a total of £26,635 for his behaviour in that match, after the ATP chose to punish him for four separate offences. That followed another flashpoint at the Indian Wells Masters in March. He was charged £19,028 after an incident which saw him almost hit a ball boy with his racket after smashing it into the floor. Overall, Kyrgios has been fined at an incredible 16 separate events since 2015.
