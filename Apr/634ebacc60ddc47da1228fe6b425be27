Perhaps the Falkland Islands or even Ascension Island, with the consent of those populations of course. I think, handled diplomatically, the local people would welcome the jobs and investment the plan would bring. However much it costs will be worth it because if the authorities and the legal system stand firm, the problem of migrants crossing the Channel will disappear after a while, certainly within two or three years. ------ Enver Solomon of the Refugee Council is misguided in saying that sending migrants who cross the Channel to Rwanda is a cruel approach, says Kath Cross, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester He says that nobody risks their or a family member's life unless they are running from acute danger. If this were true they would claim asylum in the first safe country in which they arrived. Sending them to Rwanda is a great idea. ----- How much longer is the Partygate pantomime going to go on? The PM has apologised yet those in the Westminster bubble are determined to wring the story out until the last pips squeak, says Tony Thomas, from Solihull, West Midlands. If we're honest, thousands of us did the same but weren't pursued by an apparently politicised police force which wasted thousands of hours and thousands of pounds on its investigation. The cost of living, energy prices and Ukraine are more important. For heaven's sake, move on. ----- I lost someone very dear to me in July 2020. Six of the family were with him when he passed, says Mary Sutton from Stratford, Greater London. The family gathered at my home trying to console each other, as I am sure many who had lost loved ones did.We must have broken the rules. As for the disgusting way that the Prime Minister is being treated, he was a man who nearly died of Covid and on his birthday a relieved wife decided to celebrate the fact that he was still with her.
