A study of 2,000 adults revealed 73 percent have also returned to the same hotel abroad more than once, averaging more than four return trips. Over half (55 percent) of those who have holidayed at the same resort do not want to change, with more than a quarter enjoying the familiar faces. And nearly a third liked not having to plan for the unknown. It also emerged 42 percent have an annual holiday routine.  However, 53 percent intend to visit somewhere they have never been before on their next jaunt. Experiencing a new culture, trying food they have never eaten and enjoying a mix of the city as well as the beach were the other top intentions. More than half also plan to book their next holiday abroad in the next six months, according to the OnePoll data. Some 58 percent said they had not left the UK since the start of the Covid pandemic. A little outside guidance would be appreciated by 43 percent for their next trip, with the hot topics being where to go, how to get a better deal and what to avoid. The study also found exploring a new location, experiencing a new culture and the sense of adventure were the top things people enjoy most about a new holiday. And 29 percent would like a trip spanning multiple continents or countries, but have still to take the leap. Eamonn Ferrin, at Norwegian Cruise Line, which commissioned the research, said: "It's clear much of the population struggle to get inspired to try something new. "It can be so easy to fall into the trap of doing the same thing, but just taking that extra leap can bring so many new memories."
