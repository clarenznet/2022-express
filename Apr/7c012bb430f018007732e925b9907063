Emergency services rushed to the nursery in the Ulyanovsk region in the west of the country following reports of a shooting on Tuesday. A man opened fire inside the school in the village of Veshkayma, killing two children and a teacher before turning the gun on himself. A source told the Tass news agency: "He opened fire in the room where the children were sleeping." The children are understood to have been five and six years old. The gunman has not yet been identified. The source told Tass that a domestic conflict may have been behind the shooting, but this has not been confirmed by authorities.   The region's governor, Aleksey Russkikh, is due to visit the nursery school following the horror incident. Regional vice-governor Alexander Korobko said: "According to preliminary information, the gun belonged to another person - not to the one who fired." State Duma deputy from the region, Sergei Morozov, wrote on Telegram: "On the situation in Veshkaym, where a terrible crime took place. "I spoke with representatives of the executive branch and with the deputy corps. "According to preliminary information, a nanny, two children born in 2016 and 2017 were killed." Baza, a Telegram channel with purported links to Russiaâ€™s security services, shared unconfirmed reports that the man was armed with an Izh-27 double-barreled shotgun. Pictures taken at the scene show an ambulance outside the building. The horror incident comes just under a year since one of the worst mass shootings in Russian history. Seven students and two teachers were killed in a shooting at a school in Kazan, Tatarstan, in May 2021.
