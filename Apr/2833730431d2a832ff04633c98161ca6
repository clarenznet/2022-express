He honed his skills while conducting rallies for controversial American baptist Billy Graham. Born in London, he was the older brother of Gareth Thomas who played Roj Blake in Blake's 7. After Westminster School, he studied at universities in Minnesota and Hawaii. He returned to Britain and became a consultant for the Conservatives in 1978. Initially, he worked on membership campaigns but was soon livening up Thatcher's key messages and pre-election rallies. Days before the Tories swept to power, he oversaw Mrs Thatcher's speech at Wembley Conference Centre which saw her enter to "Hello Maggie" by Lulu. Thomas also organised conferences and was at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984 when it was bombed by the IRA. The blast threw him from bed on the seventh floor to the fifth. He lay buried under rubble in the cold, water pouring over him from broken pipes, for more than two hours. A born-again Christian turned Baptist, he later said he prayed for his pregnant wife and their unborn baby. His daughter Leah arrived days after his rescue. He later forgave bomber Patrick Magee and formed a friendship with him. Thomas worked on larger rallies towards the end of Mrs Thatcher's reign and provided media training for politicians. He was appointed CBE in 1990 for his services to the Prime Minister. In later life, he continued his communication work around the globe. He is survived by his wife Marlies Kram and their two daughters. Harvey Thomas, born April 10, 1939, died March 13, 2022
