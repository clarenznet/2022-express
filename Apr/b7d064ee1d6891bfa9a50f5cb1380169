The man behind Nothing is Carl Pei who is famed for co-founding the hugely successful OnePlus smartphone brand and it appears the technology entrepreneur has big plans for his latest venture. "This is it. Itâ€™s now official. This summer we will be launching our first ever smartphone - phone (1). While it is going to be unlike anything you have seen, and I am super excited about it, this is just the start of the Nothing story," Pei said. We'll find out more about the Nothing Android phone in the coming months but to build some excitement around the brand, the firm has released a download that brings its unique styling to rival devices such as those made by Samsung and Google.
