On Tuesday, the Government confirmed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson along with his wife, Carrie, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak had all received fixed penalty notices for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in Downing Street. Mr Johnson has now become the UK's first serving PM to be sanctioned for breaking the law. All three have apologised for their actions, though Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer is fronting calls from opposition parties for Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to resign without delay.  In a tweet, Sir Keir said: “Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public. “They must both resign. The Conservatives are totally unfit to govern. Britain deserves better.” Do you agree with Sir Keir that the PM must resign? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
