Tom Parker's widow Kelsey paid tribute to her late husband today with a poignant accessory dedicated to The Wanted star. Kelsey wore a gold hair clip spelling out Tom's name in her blonde hair as she held back tears while attending his funeral service at St Francis of Assisi church earlier today. Kelsey wore a long, black dress to follow the carriage that was being pulled by two black horses as it made its way to the church. She was flanked by her parents who had linked their arms on either side of her. The mother-of-two had added a shiny purple blazer over the top of her dress which also featured a revealing panel at the front. However, it was the accessories Kelsey wore that carried special significance as she laid her husband to rest.

Kelsey's hair clip comes as their two children, Aurelia and Bodhi, left their own tribute for their dad. The tots had stayed at home for the funeral but were at the service in spirit to say goodbye to their dad in the form of their own personalised tribute. Tom's coffin was carried by his The Wanted bandmates Max George, Jay McGuinness, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes, while multi-coloured roses spelling the word "Daddy" were carried out too. On top of the floral arrangement sat two cardboard photo frames carrying the word "Daddy" once more, featuring the tiny handprints of both Aurelia and Bodhi in yellow paint.
