Many made the most of the sunshine yesterday by heading to the beach, including at Tynemouth in North Tyneside.   Forecasters believe the South-east will bask in temperatures as high as 20C by Thursday and over the weekend - on a par with Spain's Costa Brava. But a North-South split means it could be a chilly 9C near Newcastle and the North-east and just 7C in Scotland.
