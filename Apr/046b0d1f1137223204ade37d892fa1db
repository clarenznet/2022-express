Of these 30 test providers, 26 required monetary payment while the results were freely available on the NHS. Dr Harding said: “Many of the providers – especially those that were for profit – didn’t comply with the national guidelines.” One of the reasons raised for turning to private test providers was anonymity.  Dr Harding explained: “Through anecdotal feedback, I think some patients are concerned NHS providers will require you to use your real name and your data will be shared with your GP – and that’s not the case.” NHS providers provide anonymous and confidential services. Having an STI can be a difficult and embarrassing time for someone. Although this research reflects negatively on online testing, the researchers believe it is a “great move in the right direction".

Examples of STIs include:• Chlamydia• Gonorrhoea• Trichomoniasis• Genital warts• Genital herpes• Pubic lice• Scabies• Syphilis• HPV. If you have any concerns regarding STIs or sexual health the NHS has a number of walk-in centres where confidential conversations can be had, and any questions answered.
