  Johnny Depp, 58, is answering questions in court from ex-wife Amber Heard's lawyer, Ben Rottenborn, as the $50 million libel trial continues in Virginia. During the trial, an email sent from Johnny to pop legend Sir Elton John in 2013 was read aloud, revealing that the star had referred to ex-partner Vanessa Paradis as a “French extortionist” and a “c***”.      Vanessa Paradis is the mother of Johnny’s two children, Lily-Rose Depp, 22, and Jack Depp, 20. While Johnny was questioned by Amber Heard's lawyer, Mr Rottenborn, he admitted that one expletive filled email he had sent to Sir Elton John years ago referred to the French singer. Mr Rottenborn then read the email that Johnny had sent to singer Elton out to the court, in which he made negative remarks about Vanessa, who he had dated for approximately 14 years between 1998 and 2012. In the email, Johnny told Sir Elton about a “French extortionist (ex-c***)” who was trying to “brainwash” his children.

Johnny is currently suing his ex-wife Amber for defamation over an article she wrote for the Washington Post in 2018 about how she had suffered from domestic violence, though he was never mentioned by name. Before his email was read out in court yesterday, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was first taken back to his testimony that he gave during his libel trial against The Sun in 2020. The lawyer made reference to the end of Johnny's relationship with Vanessa, who he shared the set with in the film Ninth Gate.      Mr Rottenborn asked Johnny about his sister Christi Dembrowski's concerns about his drug consumption. In the UK court, Johnny had said that his break-up was a "painful" time and that he was "more than likely trying to numb" himself. He told the US court that at the time he was abusing alcohol, but did not say he was abusing drugs during that period. Johnny also told the court that he had been experiencing liver problems at that time. READ MORE...

In the email, the star described how his children had "fallen head over heels in deep love with Amber". He added: “The pressure off my shoulders is f***ing gone”. The Hollywood actors drew mass media attention back in 2020, after Johnny attempted to sue UK tabloid The Sun for libel.        Johnny lost the case in November 2020 after the court upheld the publication's claims as being “substantially true”. The actor later attempted to overturn the decision, but it was overruled in March 2021. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks, and jurors have so far been presented with various accounts of Johnny and Amber's relationship.
