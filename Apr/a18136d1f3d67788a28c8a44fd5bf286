   Emma wore a bright orange dress with a high neckline, which featured a design of overlapping balloons printed onto the fabric. Tying the unusual look together was a small, skin-coloured shiny bralette, which had balloon ties stuck to the material as if to take the idea further. A closer look revealed the black, shiny ankle boots Emma wore also looked as if they had been blown up like a balloon at the heel, with another fun knot at the back. Emma accessorised the creative garment with some hoop earrings and another larger black earring across one ear.  The star also wore some bangles and opted for a minimalist makeup look with some smokey shadow around the eye. Emma was rocking a short, white-blonde hair style with a long fringe coming down over the eyebrows.
