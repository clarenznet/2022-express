So it is very good news indeed that at long last a significant step forward has been taken in tackling the issue of illegal migrants coming over in small boats to the UK across the English Channel. The agreement with Rwanda to host a holding centre where migrants can have their asylum applications processed is a historic one. It means that they can be flown out there and have a fair assessment over whether they need to be granted asylum in the UK.  ------------------------------ Spend our taxes wisely Lockdowns and restrictions were imposed over the last two years for the best of reasons, to protect people’s lives. But nothing comes for free and now we are seeing the cost of these policies. Not only are we paying more tax with the recent National Insurance increase but in today’s newspaper we reveal six million people are caught in a mammoth NHS treatment backlog with dozens already having had to wait three years or more. This is not sustainable and it highlights why the money raised by the new health and social care tax must be used to bring down the waiting times dramatically. ------------------------------ Flying the flag for Britain The Spitfire will always remain iconic for its role in helping to win the Battle of Britain and the Second World War. It was certainly a joy to see another of these historic fighter planes – one of 14 restored by the Biggin Hill Heritage Hangar – flying over the white cliffs of Dover. No doubt those who witnessed its flight will have felt a sense of patriotic pride for this country’s great history.
