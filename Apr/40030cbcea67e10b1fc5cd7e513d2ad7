We head along a dirt road into a guarded sanctuary that is home to more than 100 black and white rhinos. It is off-limits to the public because of the threat of poaching for their horns. The rhinos here are thriving and Born Free helps by providing fuel for rangers to patrol the area and solar panels to charge phones for back-up. Newton says: "The last case of rhino poaching in Meru was in 2018, so you can see the impact of our support." Sadly, we do not see the King of the Savannah, but Born Free's Pride of Meru project safeguards lions, often injured by snares meant for smaller animals. At the same time locals are struggling to co-exist with elephants, which raid their crops and get injured or killed when farmers retaliate with force. Newton says: "Education is paramount. Awareness and training of local communities is vital in conservation." Like the lions, the elephants do not emerge. But a few days later we spot a mother and calf enjoying a dawn breakfast at Samburu National Reserve, three hours from Meru. There is nothing quite like seeing wild animals exactly where they are meant to be.
