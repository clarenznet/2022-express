Tourists travelling to Belgium from today will be impacted by the additional charges. They received an email, in which they were told how much extra they would have to cough up. Belgian Embarkation Tax, which comes into force today, was first proposed by the country’s government last October on distances of less than 500 km in order to encourage alternatives. However, it will now apply to all flights, including passengers travelling by private plane or helicopter, reports the Liverpool Echo. In the email, Ryanair said: "On 25 March 2022, Belgium introduced a new flight tax on passengers departing Belgium from 1 April 2022. This means that even if a passenger booked a flight before 25 March, which is due to depart Belgium on or after 1 April, we must pay this new tax to the Belgian government. "This new tax is charged at the rate of between €2 and €10 depending on destination." The applicable tax in respect to flights to the UK is understood to be €4 (approximately £3.37) per passenger. Airlines, including Air Belgium, Brussels Airlines, and TUI, last month expressed their disappointment at the establishment of the tax. A Belgian Air Transport Association (BATA) spokesman said: "This decision is legally questionable, as it does not follow the recommendations of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), that as from the moment the official texts have been finalised and validated by the different instances (yesterday by the Parliament), an implementation timeline of at least four months is necessary to update the different booking systems and inform the passengers." BATA also pointed out that this new tax represents an additional financial burden for the Belgian aviation sector
