Charles Leclerc will start the Australian Grand Prix on pole position after he beat Max Verstappen in the final flying lap of Q3. Verstappen will have some support from his Red Bull team-mate Serio Perez, who earned third place on the grid. McLaren have had a massive upturn in fortunes this weekend and Lando Norris joins Perez on the second row. The pair of Mercedes occupy the third row, with Lewis Hamilton narrowly beating team-mate George Russell. Daniel Ricciardo, Esteban Ocon, Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso complete the top 10. After missing out on pole, Verstappen said: "I do not feel good. I didn't really feel good the whole weekend so far. I don't think there has been one lap where I have felt confident. "It was a bit of a struggle. Of course, second is still a good result but it is hard to go to the limit. For me, this weekend so far has been all over the place, happy to be second, but as a team we want more."
