According to ex-Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, Harry and Meghan "wind each other up", unlike the Cambridges whom she said, "calm each other down". Ms Brown also said that Harry believes he can "save" Meghan in a way that he could not save his mother. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will visit The Hague later this week for the Invictus Games, in what will be Meghan's first visit to Europe since the couple stepped down from senior royal duties in 2020.
