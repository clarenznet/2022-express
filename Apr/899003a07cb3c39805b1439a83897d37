The Home Secretary said the review of the Prevent programme, due to report soon, is "really important to me" and that "things need to change". A number of significant attacks have been carried out by individuals linked to the scheme in recent years. They include Ali Harbi Ali, who was convicted last week of murdering Conservative MP Sir David Amess. Ms Patel, who was close to Sir David, said: "I can't prejudge a review but it's quite clear, I say this from my own observations and what I see, that there are things that need to change." Ali, 26, boasted about fooling the authorities when he was referred to the deradicalisation scheme. He told the court that when engaging with the authorities he "knew to nod my head and say yes and they would leave me alone afterwards". The Prevent review was launched in January last year to consider the UK's strategy for "protecting people vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism". A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation being broadcast tonight has found that out of 13 terror attacks in the last five years, seven of the offenders were known to Prevent. Fourteen people were killed in the attacks with 128 injured. The programme also reveals that fewer than one in ten convicted terrorists take part in Prevent behind bars. Ninety could be eligible for release this year.
