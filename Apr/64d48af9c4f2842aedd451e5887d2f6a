Canford Heath is an area of heathland in Poole, Dorset. The road near the heath, called Canford Way, has now been closed as fire crews battle the blaze. The fire spread down towards the roundabout and emergency services have closed off part of the road. Twitter user, Andy Whiting, tweeted: "Sad to see quite an extensive fire on Canford Heath. "This is as well as the tragic effect on the wildlife. "It must be concerning that the flames are quite close to the housing estate." The fire is causing thick smoke to blow down into an area of housing near the heath.  Emergency services have told anyone living near the heath to keep their windows and doors closed. Some people living very close to the heath have been evacuated as a precaution on safety grounds. Canford Heath Neighbourhood Watch tweeted: "Fire on the heath. "Fire Rescue in attendance.  "Please avoid the heathland. "Try to keep doors and windows closed where possible and keep animals inside. "Stay safe." Dorset Police tweeted: "Dorset Police is assisting with this incident and Ashdown Leisure Centre is being opened as a local evacuation centre for anyone unable to access their homes."
