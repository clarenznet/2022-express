Michelle Keegan, 34, has sent fans into a frenzy with a brand new Instagram post, showing her posing on a beach wearing a tiny bikini. The former Coronation Street star looked incredible in the strapless two-piece, which showed off her gym-sculpted figure. Alongside a picturesque backdrop of bright blue water and white sand, Michelle styled her beach look with gold jewellery, and kept her hair away from her face in a ponytail. All was not what it seemed though, as Michelle revealed in the caption that she was actually at home in her pyjamas when she posted the snap. She joked to her 5.7 million followers: “Body at home this morning still in PJs but my mind is here.” Michelle’s bronze swimwear is from Isa Boulder and will set shoppers back £223. The holiday pic sent fans wild, and hundreds took to the comments to compliment the brunette beauty. A fan named Emily tagged a friend and said: “She is unreal,” while Nathan exclaimed: “Fittest woman in the world.” Michelle’s celebrity friends also gushed over the star including a stunned Vicky Pattison, who said: ”Babe,” with a heart eye emoji, alongside Coronation Street actor Charlie Condou, who agreed: “My mind is right with you!”
