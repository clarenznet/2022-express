Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised to the House of Commons yesterday after it emerged that he’d attended and been fined for one of the 12 illegal parties held at Downing Street currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police. However, Mr Johnson is believed to have attended six of the parties, meaning more fines could be imminent. Since the notice was issued, the Prime Minister has been facing numerous calls to resign from post, with former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper submitting a letter of no confidence in the Tory leader yesterday afternoon.  He said he rejected Johnson’s apology, stating: “I regret to say that we have a PM who broke the laws that he told the country to follow…I no longer think he is worthy of the great office that he holds.” Mr Johnson said the “hurt and anger” caused by his actions has given him “an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people”. Mr Johnson is due to head to India for £28 billion trade deal tomorrow on a Brexit boost mission to deepen long-term partnerships. But while the Prime Minister fights to retain his position as threats of no-confidence votes stir, will Mr Johnson be able to deliver on his obligation to deliver on priorities?
