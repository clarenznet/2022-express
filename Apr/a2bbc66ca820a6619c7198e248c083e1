While fellow presenter Michael Barratt was seen as a no-nonsense Yorkshireman, Wellings teased out irony and humour in the stories and features he covered. In 1979, he introduced viewers to then barely-known gardener Alan Titchmarsh and he often interviewed big Hollywood stars of the era, including Gregory Peck. Interviewing Kirk Douglas, he prised an anecdote from the star about how he wound down his car window to ask a young hitchhiker if he wanted a lift, only to be told: "Do you know who you are?" He sharpened his presenting skills on That's Life! with Esther Rantzen and George Layton, fighting for consumers who had been ripped off, and amusing viewers with odd-shaped vegetables. Robert Arthur Wellings was born in Jerusalem to Francis Wellings, the Shropshire-born chief geologist of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and Louise, from Texas.
