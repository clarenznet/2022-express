Will snapped the soap star, who has played Ken Barlow since Coronation Street began in 1960, at his home in Cheshire. Dad-of-five Bill said: “Will is really talented, he studied photography when he was younger, but for me it was about how relaxed we all felt. “We were all just chatting and laughing and he knew just when to capture the moment. I can honestly say those are the best photographs I’ve ever had taken.” Will, who starred in an ITV show marking his dad’s birthday, added: “I think just having the family there made my father feel more relaxed. “It enabled me to capture his true vivacious personality and vibrant essence, the part of him we are lucky enough to see every day.” Two of the photos will feature in an updated version of Bill’s book, Life And Soul.
