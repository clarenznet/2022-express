If you’re the kind of shopper that relishes snagging a big discount, you must love the £10 Tuesday sale at Boots.  Taking place just once a week, the sale sees makeup, skincare, health, and dental products from major brands slashed to just £10. And when we say major brands, we mean it - products from Nip+Fab, Olay, Oral-B, and L’Oreal have all seen major price reductions. This means the discount reaches as high as 70 percent on some products - but at the end of Tuesday, the sale is over and the products go back to their original prices.
