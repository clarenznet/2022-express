Posing by the hotel pool, Demi Rose kept her ensemble looking chic in a classic black swimsuit, the simplicity of which perfectly accented her voluptuous figure. "Hot girl spring?" she teased in her Instagram caption as she showcased her assets to an impressive 19.3 million followers. Demi was indulging in the French holiday in celebration of her recent 27th birthday. She didn't let the alpine chill deter her from boasting her collection of revealing outfits, having showcased a sheer sleeveless top yesterday. Her modesty was maintained only by a sparkly crystallised spider's web style design around the bust and collar area. Photos from the break showed her partying with a drink in hand and posing outdoors with snow-capped landscapes as a backdrop, in a village that is often described as the "ski capital of the world". She previously donned furry white snow boots, worn against totally bare legs, as she flew to the destination. It's the most recent in a string of holiday breaks, after the jetsetting beauty showed up earlier this month in Caribbean hotspot St Lucia.
