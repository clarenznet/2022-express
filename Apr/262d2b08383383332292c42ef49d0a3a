The Austrian Football Association have issued a statement denying that a secret meeting took place with Ralf Rangnick in Manchester on Monday. Vienna-based newspaper Kurier had reported that Austria's sporting director Peter Schottel had flown to the North West of England at the start of the week to discuss potential terms with Rangnick, in a bid to entice him into a new managerial role.  Das Team are on the lookout for a new boss after Franco Foda decided to step down following the 2-2 friendly draw with Scotland last week. Austria were beaten 2-1 by Wales in Cardiff in their World Cup qualification play-off semi-final, courtesy of Gareth Bale's stunning double. Rangnick has since supposedly made his way towards the top of Austria's shortlist, although he is set to move upstairs at Old Trafford this summer into a new consultancy role with United. However, Austria have now moved to deny speculation linking Rangnick with the vacant managerial hot-seat in a bid to set the record straight.

It's claimed Rangnick will only have to work around six days per month in his new consultancy role. That could potentially provide him with leverage to take on an international job alongside his position with United - providing he had the club's approval. Rangnick's stock remains high in Austrian football from his time working as RB Salzburg's sporting director. United feel he still has an important part to play in the coming years at Old Trafford.
