Britons can benefit from tax relief on their pension savings, but only up to a certain point. The presence of the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) looms over those who have saved effectively for retirement.  The LTA imposes a limit on the tax-free amount Britons can save towards retirement during their life. The limit currently stands at £1,073,100. There could be a financial penalty imposed on people who exceed the LTA. This could come in the form of a tax charge of up to 55 percent. Britons who breach the LTA must report this on their self-assessment tax return.

This could be bad news for pension savers, as the effects of inflation over time could push more people over the limit.

As the name suggests, this caps the tax-free pension savings of Britons in a given year. It currently stands at £40,000. As with the LTA, anyone who exceeds the Annual Allowance must report this on their tax return.
