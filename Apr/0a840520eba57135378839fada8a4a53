It said that most passengers were able to switch onto alternative flights travelling on the same day.

Airlines have faced issues with staff shortages in recent weeks due to illness from Covid. Sickness has exacerbated existing staffing problems as many workers found a job in a different industry during Covid. Airports have also struggled with a shortage of security staff and are currently on a recruitment drive. It can be difficult to train and hire security staff due to the high level of clearance required to work at an airport. Passengers are advised to travel to the airport with plenty of time to spare to make sure they make their flight. It is also a good idea to sort liquids before security to make sure the process is speedy. Recently, a Heathrow boss partly blamed passengers for chaos at the airport during the Easter holidays. He said that some travellers had forgotten travel rules such as how many liquids could go through security.
