Tweeting at 1pm today, the air force said that the two types of military planes had flown out of RAF Marham in Norfolk and RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland. The latter is one of two RAF Quick Reaction Alert stations which monitor and police UK airspace.  Images released alongside the statement show the planes flying in formation and refuelling mid-air. The RAF commented: "These skills are vital to protect the UK and support NATO and our allies." Military cooperation between NATO allies has become increasingly prominent since Putin's invasion of Ukraine nearly two months ago. The Russian President has simultaneously made coded threats towards NATO members while claiming they were responsible for provoking Russia.   US military planes have been spotted in the UK in recent weeks, as part of allied operations. Since the war in Ukraine began, the RAF has been instrumental in delivering military equipment - including anti-tank weaponry - to the Ukrainian armed forces. RAF jets took to the skies over Europe in February as part of a NATO response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. An RAF Voyager was captured on camera refuelling Typhoons on the continent as part of NATO’s Enhanced Vigilance Activity.   Last week, Boris Johnson announced new support for Ukraine, including a further eight hundred anti-tank missiles. The Prime Minister's latest package is valued at more than £100million, and comes on top of the £350 million of military aid already announced.   Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said earlier this month that a further two RAF Typhoons would be stationed in south-eastern Europe, bringing the total to 14. Typhoon IX(B) Squadron, which was involved in today's exercise, has also led aerial attacks on government installations in the country, as well as targetting ISIS in Syria.
