The Techne survey says 32 percent of voters are now less likely to support restrictions after it was revealed Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for attending a nine-minute birthday party for the PM in the Cabinet Room. Just seven percent are more likely to support new lockdowns while the opinions of 55 percent are unchanged, according to the poll of 1,500 voters. It also showed 55 percent of people believe the Government's two top ministers should resign over the scandal. The Metropolitan Police has not ruled out issuing more fines as officers investigate other alleged incidents in Downing Street while lockdown restrictions were in place. The recent report by civil servant Sue Gray identified 16 events which took place over a dozen dates between May 2020 and April 2021 as potentially breaking the rules. Following his fine on Tuesday, Mr Johnson apologised, stating: "I want to be able to get on and deliver the mandate I have, but also tackle the problems that the country must face right now. "I believe that it's my job to get on and deliver for the people of this country and that is what I'm going to do." Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Covid numbers were now on the wane. In the week leading up to April 9 around one in 15 people had the virus, which was down from one in 14 the week before. Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: "Across most parts of the UK, infections have thankfully begun to decrease. Although it is too early to say if we have passed the peak of infections, and infections overall remain high."
