Authors for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found increasing evidence of climate action but said the world must have global emissions by 2030. Dr Jo House, a lead author and a reader in environmental science at the University of Bristol, said: "The lack of global progress is depressing, it is literally killing people, and is felt in every country. "However what gives me hope is the progress in some countries that have reduced greenhouse gas emission year on year for more than 10 years."
