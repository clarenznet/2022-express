The victim is believed to be aged between 25 and 30. He died after being knifed several times near an apartment in the centre of Albufeira in the Algarve, according to reports. Emergency services were alerted at about 7am on Monday, but efforts to save his life at the scene proved unsuccessful. Reports locally say a man carrying a knife with blood on his hands was found and identified inside a nearby flat. It is understood that he and his alleged victim knew each other. The victim’s nationality has yet to be confirmed by the authorities, however it is reported the man is British.  The suspect’s nationality is also yet to be confirmed by Portuguese officials. Portugal's Policia Judiciaria force has since launched an investigation. Officers from Portugal’s GNR force were first on the scene along with paramedics. As of publication, it is unknown whether the man lived in Portugal or was on holiday. The flat has been described by officials as being part of a tourist complex where foreign tourists usually stay.
