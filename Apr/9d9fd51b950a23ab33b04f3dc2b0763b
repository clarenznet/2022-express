Two-year-old Siamese Ashley somehow travelled from North Wales to the other side of London in the space of six days, with no one knowing where she was. She escaped through an open window in her home in Glan Conwy on April 15, before being discovered in North Stifford on April 21. Her owner Dan Worsley believes the cat made a dash for it when the cleaners left the bathroom window open and she jumped 15ft to the ground. He and his wife Val assumed she was “asleep somewhere”, before realising she had disappeared.  He said: "The whole village, 4,000 people, were out looking for her, but not a trace. “The longer it went the more distraught we got, we thought we would never see her again." But they were reunited after Ashley showed up 280 miles away in Essex. Carol Monk’s dog discovered the Siamese cat in their North Stifford garage. Ms Monk and her partner Allan Baker were alerted when dog Bobby began scratching and crying. She said he was “very insistent there was something in our garage”.

Volunteer Karen Keeves in Tilbury scanned Ashley, and then contacted Mr Worseley. He said the family were “beside ourselves with joy” to have her home. Mr Worsley added that, while he was “elated” to have his cat back, “she complained all the way to Newport Pagnell services” on the journey home. How exactly Ashley managed to get from North Wales to Essex by herself remains completely unexplained. Mr Worsely said he believed she had “got into somebody’s vehicle and hitchhiked”.
