    Outlander star Annette Badland, 71, played fan favourite character Mrs. Fitz in the first season of the popular Scottish series, but she has been noticeably absent from the show ever since. The actress has now told Express.co.uk that she “would like to be remembered” and suggested that she could perhaps return in a dream sequence.        Now in its sixth season, Outlander is a historical drama show that takes place around the time of the Jacobite rising. In the series, Annette’s character Mrs. Fitz is the head housekeeper of Castle Leoch and faces an uncertain future after the dissolution of the clans and destruction of the castle at the end of season 1. When asked if she would ever return to the show, Annette revealed that she would like to be asked back, if only to make a brief cameo appearance, while hinting at her sadness over the situation. She said: “I’m deeply upset that no one's ever had a dream about me or something, you know?

When asked what it was like working on the set of Outlander, Annette revealed: “It was great!” “Sam (Heughan), myself and Tobias (Menzies) were the first three to be cast and I went up to Scotland for a costume fitting.        “And Sam walked into the room and you kind of go, ‘Ooh’, but what was really breathtaking is that he’s such a wonderful man. “So polite and doesn’t have any arrogance about him.” Annette went on to describe the close bond she formed with lead actress Caitriona Balfe during her time on set. “Cat is absolutely splendid and a wonderful human being and she’s just marvellous to work with,” she explained.

It just takes so long, getting the stockings on, getting the shoes on, the gloves, everything! “So that was quite amusing because we knew absolutely that it would take forever and Terry said, ‘I told them, they’re just not listening!’ So yes, that was all very funny.” The latest episode of Outlander Season 6 is available today on StarzPlay.
