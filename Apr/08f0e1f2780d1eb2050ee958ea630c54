The Grand National is the most prestigious steeplechase in the world and Express Sport has picked four horses who could race to victory at Aintree. The main four-and-a-half mile event gets underway at 5.15pm and Express Sport is on hand with four potential winners. 1) Any Second Now Any Second Now finished third in last year's Grand National and is priced at around 10/1 to emerge victorious this year. Legendary jockey Ruby Walsh said: "Trained by Dad, he looked unlucky in the race last year, when he suffered huge interference at the 12th fence, but somehow managed to get himself back into the race to finish third. He only carried 10-9 then, and he’s carrying 11-8 this year so it’s going to be a different race for him, but he looks in great form and is certainly the one I’ll be cheering home." 2) Delta Work Delta Work is tipped to step into Tiger Rolls footsteps and is another frontrunner priced at around 10/1. Walsh says: "Is he a replacement for Tiger Roll? He was brilliant in the Cross Country Chase, when he beat Tiger Roll, and I loved the way he took to those jumps. But there is question mark over him in big fields. Can he handle the hustle and bustle? He is a five-time Grade One winner and if he adapts to a handicap, he is the one that is going to take most of the beating." 3) Longhouse Poet Has massive potential and can be found around 12/1. Walsh's view: "Trained by Martin Brassil, who won the race with Numbersixvalverde, he was a good winner of the Thyestes and then had a run over hurdles to keep himself ready for this. Almost a Grade One novice hurdler, he’s going in the right direction and is a big player." 4) Snow Leopardess A 3-3 record so far this year and a decent candidate at 10/1. Walsh says: "A pleasure to watch wining the Becher Chase, but she’d want as much rain as is forecast to fall to help her hold a position. I’m not sure she has the vital early speed."
