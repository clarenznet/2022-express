In the year from March 2021 to the end of February 2022 there were 17,022 cases passed from the National Crime Agency to police forces, up from 14,260 in the previous 12 months. Cases often involve groomers coercing children to send self-generated explicit images and video of themselves which can be shared among paedophiles. The figures were released by the Government in response to a parliamentary question from Shadow Culture Secretary Lucy Powell, who requested the data to aid discussions around the Online Safety Bill. She said: "The Government is failing to keep children safe online. Criminals are being let off while victims are let down. "The Bill is long overdue but has gaping holes which mean predators can continue to prey on children online across platforms."
