Simon Cowell, 62, has spoken about his “horrendous” e-bike accident, which required back surgery. In 2020, Simon sustained serious injuries when he fell off his electric bike. He had another accident earlier this year, where he broke his arm. The 62-year-old was also suspected to have a possible concussion as a result. Despite these accidents, the Britain’s Got Talent judge can’t bring himself to part with his e-bike. He also has a positive outlook on the way the accidents have impacted his life.
