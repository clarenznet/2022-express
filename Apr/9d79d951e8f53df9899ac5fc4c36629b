The former police officer is accused of four "flashing" incidents in Swanley, Kent, last year. Couzens, 49, yesterday appeared at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link from prison. He gave no indication of pleas but, told the case could be heard before magistrates or the crown court, he said: "My legal team have advised me at the crown court." Couzens is serving a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah, 33, in March last year.
