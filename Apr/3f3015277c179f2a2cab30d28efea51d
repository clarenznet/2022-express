Nuclear weapons have not acted as a deterrent to a brutal war by a Russian army, made up of barbarians not soldiers, out of control and committing heinous war crimes. It is not just Putin but the Russian people as well. They must know by now what is going on and they do nothing to stop it. If the Russians would show some backbone they could oust their dictator and restore some respect. As it is, Russia has been ostracised from the world. People will remember this for decades. Liz Truss says £266billion of the £459billion of Russia's foreign currency reserves have been frozen, says Paul Chatland, from Kenilworth, Warks. Some way should be found to use all that money to make reparations to the Ukrainians for the destruction of their country. By depriving Russia of these reserve funds it will send a warning that actions have consequences. And if it cripples Russia's economy for years to come, so be it. We hand India, a nuclear power, tens of millions of pounds a year. It has a space programme in a country of extremes of poverty, yet Liz Truss is prepared to make trade deals with the country, says Tom Johnson, from Leicester. It supports China and Russia and abstained from the recent vote by the United Nations to expel Russia from the Human Rights Council. Let's wake up; stop pandering and tell the country's leaders the facts, and that includes their citizens settling here too.  How on earth can those hospitals urge patients to stay away from A&E when they know the downright truth is it is almost impossible to see our own GPs? The GPs are creating the problems in A&E, not patients, says Geoff Fawcett, from Workington, Cumbria. The people making this plea would appear to be devoid of common sense. They should perhaps be, with strong governmental support, instructing GPs to get back to normal as other aspects of society have already done.
