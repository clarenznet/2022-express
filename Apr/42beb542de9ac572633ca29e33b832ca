The state pension is set to rise on April 11, 2022, increasing the weekly income of millions of British pensioners. However, rampant inflation is still posing a serious threat to the spending power of pensioners. Currently, the value of the full new state pension is £179.60 a week. Pensioners who were paid the full new state pension for the entire 2021/22 tax year would therefore have received £9,339.20. The full basic state pension pays out £137.60 a week, or £7,155.20 for a full year. A 3.1 percent increase to the state pension will be implemented in a few weeks’ time. This will take the full new state pension up to £185.15 a week, or an extra £5.55.

The full basic state pension will rise to £141.85 when the increase kicks in. Those who receive this will get an extra £221 in the 2022/23 tax year as a result. However, the increase to the state pension pales in comparison to the current rate of inflation.

This means that although pensioners may be getting extra cash each week, their income may actually be lower in real terms. Pensioners could have got a boost to their state pension of more than eight percent in April, but the Government made changes to how the state pension is increased to prevent this. The original expected increase was a result of the triple lock policy, which ensures the state pension must increase every year by the highest of three figures. These are: An unusually high rate of earnings growth was the reason for the projected increase of more than eight percent. However, the Government decided to temporarily remove the earnings link from the triple lock policy as they believed it would be unfair to taxpayers for the state pension to rise by such a large percentage. The resulting 3.1 percent increase to the state pension comes from the rate of inflation for the year to September 2021. In the subsequent months, inflation has continued to soar, and this has led to a situation whereby the rate of inflation is outpacing the state pension increase.
