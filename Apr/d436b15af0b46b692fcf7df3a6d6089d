The Prime Minister was presented with a club shirt after having a kickabout, he was then asked if he had been issued any more fines by civil servant Sue Gray, who is investigating alleged lockdown parties at No10. The PM replied: "There is absolutely no circumstance in which I'm going to comment on that before the thing is complete." Asked if he was still an asset to the Tories in the elections, he said: "I'm not denying that." Then he added: "I think that the greatest asset the Conservatives have are Conservative values and the way that Conservative councillors up and down the country deliver taxpayer value." Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesman said the PM had not received any further fines for violating Covid laws. He added: "There is nothing to update on." Labour accused Mr Johnson of "running scared" from MPs after he declined to make a Commons statement about his trip to India." Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said it showed last week's visit had been "nothing more than a pathetic attempt to distract from his lies and law-breaking at home".
