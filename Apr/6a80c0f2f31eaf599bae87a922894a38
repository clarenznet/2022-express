Helen Bridges said her niece had suffered stress due to the controversy, and should have been allowed to participate in a women's competition tomorrow. She said she understood why officials banned Emily, but called for a "trans" class for elite athletes.  The sport's authorities said she was ineligible for the National Omnium Championships in Derby after critics said she had an unfair advantage. Helen, 64, said: "It's a bit of a tough one but I guess it's unfair. It is unfair but the others obviously think it's unfair on them so it's a very, very difficult situation. "Maybe trans athletes should have their own class but I think they should be allowed to do it. I really do feel for Emily. "There's a lot more to it given the amount of emotions she's been through." Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies was among the cyclist's highest-profile critics. The 1980 silver medallist and TV host claimed Emily and other athletes born male have an "incredibly unfair" edge over biological women rivals. Sharron, 59, told GB News: "[Emily] competed with the men's team very successfully last year whilst reducing testosterone. This is wrong and people must start calling it out or lose sport for future generations of young girls. "We spend millions trying to spot people having the tiniest advantage by taking drugs. Yet women are supposed to move over so that males are able to come into their sports, and just give up their trophies." The Union Cycliste Internationale - cycling's world governing body - said that Emily, 21, is ineligible under current guidelines.
