Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William celebrate their 11th wedding anniversary today. The royal couple made it official in a lavish ceremony in Westminster Abbey. They have since become integral members of the Royal Family and are widely seen as the “future of the monarchy”. Following backlash surrounding their Caribbean tour last month, William hinted he wanted to learn from past mistakes, saying the trip had “brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future.”In a strategy dubbed the “Cambridge way”, the young royals are set to ditch the age-old mantra of “never explain, never complain” and “rip up the rulebook”.In light of the Queen’s recent ill health and mobility issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have taken on more responsibilities within the Firm.Royal commentator and PR expert, Kinsey Schofield, believes the couple’s roles in the monarchy will continue to become more involved, particularly as Prince Charles’ kingship creeps closer. She told Express.co.uk: “I do want to see them [Kate and William] a lot more because I think that they are the future of the monarchy.“I think that they are the only thing that can save the monarchy because I do think that there is going to be pushback when Charles becomes king, and as long as Prince William is on the horizon, there is hope.“He is coming. He is next.”Charles has been attending public engagements on behalf of the Queen since Her Majesty took a step back from in-person engagements.It’s a glimpse into what the British Monarchy will look like under King Charles, who is reportedly planning to work closely with his eldest son, a decision that Ms Schofield believes is necessary for the monarchy to survive. The founder of royal site, ToDiForDaily.com, said: “I think that them working together is brilliant, but I also think that it’s happening because Prince William is a much more likeable character and people really do love and celebrate him.“So what better way for Prince Charles to reign than to include him, so that people approve of some of the things that he does and some of his initiatives.She added: “All eyes will be on Britain when we lose the Queen regardless, but even more so because all eyes know that Charles is facing pushback over him becoming king.”An Express poll earlier this month found that nearly half the nation believed that Charles should step aside and allow William to be king.

Camilla, who was once vilified in the press, has worked to become a much-loved member of the Royal Family. The Duchess was endorsed by the top earlier this year when the Queen expressed her “sincere wish” for Camilla to be named Queen Consort when Charles ascends the throne.Years of endless speculation surrounding Camilla’s future title was put to rest following the Queen’s declaration.It was decided that she would be called Princess Consort upon her marriage to Charles, which is believed to have been out of respect for Diana. Both Charles and Camilla were “touched and honoured” by the Queen’s announcement, according to a statement released by Clarence House at the time.It has long been known that Charles desires a slimmed-down monarchy, and it is expected that William, Kate and Camilla will take on important roles, particularly given the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2020.The “new Fab Four” are likely to be at the centre of a modernising monarchy.
