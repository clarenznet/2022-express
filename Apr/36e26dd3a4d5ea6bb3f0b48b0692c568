Demi Rose, 27, is known for showing off her enviable figure as she takes to Instagram to show off her barely-there outfits. This weekend was no different with Demi taking to Instagram to show off her outfit for SHEIN's Zeuphoria Weekend. In view of her 19.3 million followers, the model shared a series of short videos on her Instagram story to show off her Saturday Coachella outfit. Demi sported a black sheer embellished bodysuit as she posed at the luxurious resort. The bodysuit featured silver diamond detailing, including shoulder pads and high-neck detail. Over the bodysuit the model sported a waist corset that was covered in gold and silver sequins, along with further diamante detail, drawing in the star's petite waist. Paired with the outfit, Demi wore black tight and knee-length black and white cowboy boots. Demi carried a small jukebox style square bag, while her wrists were covered in wristbands for the weekend. The model wore her signature golden locks in a high ponytail, which fell effortlessly down her back. Demi went for a simple makeup look, not taking attention away from the outfit, with a glossy lip and winged eyeliner. Along with videos of her outfit, Demi also shared videos from the event as well as a video of her dancing in the crowd.
