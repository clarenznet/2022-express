She believes "everyone should have the mickey taken out of them" sometimes - and that it is "okay". But the 53-year-old - whose new prison sitcom Hard Cell has just launched on Netflix - warns jokes "can be, and often are, wilfully misconstrued".  Catherine said: "You can't help but second guess yourself: we are in a climate where it's like touch paper at the moment. "I don't think there should be a war on jokes, I don't think there should be a war on comedy - I don't think should be a war on culture." The former Doctor Who star, said she had "never intended to offend" with her own material. "Comedy is subjective," she added. "It's in the eye of the person who's belly-laughing and I appreciate that."  However, she told the BBC's Headliners podcast: "That doesn't mean anyone has licence to go out and say things that are cruel and awful to people, that's a different thing." Tate's hit BBC sketch series The Catherine Tate Show ran for three series from 2004-07. Hard Cell, in which she plays multiple jail characters, is available to stream now on Netflix.
