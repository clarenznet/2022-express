Liverpool ended a remarkable Manchester City record as the two Premier League title rivals played out an exhilarating 2-2 draw at the Etihad on Sunday. Pep Guardiola's side were twice pegged back as goals from Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane saw Jurgen Klopp's men cancel out strikes from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus. It took only five minutes for De Bruyne to open the scoring in the epic Etihad encounter as his deflected strike evaded Alisson, and at that point, one could have been forgiven for thinking the writing was on the wall. Prior to Sunday's showdown, City had won all 22 Premier League matches in which they had scored first, however, Liverpool would bring that incredible run to an end as they twice fought back to deny the hosts another three points. The Reds responded within eight minutes of falling behind as Jota coolly slotted home following fine work from Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, to settle any Liverpool nerves following a frenetic start. However, Klopp's side suffered a second setback shortly before half-time. Guardiola gambled by handing Jesus his first Premier League start since New Year's Day, but the Brazilian forward rewarded his manager for his faith with 37 minutes on the clock. The 25-year-old ghosted in behind Liverpool's Alexander-Arnold before cushioning Joao Cancelo's whipped cross into the visitors' net, aided by the underside of the crossbar.

Jesus' effort put City in a commanding position once again, but the drama was far from finished. In fact, it took only 47 seconds of the second half for Liverpool to respond. Sadio Mane clinically dispatched Mohamed Salah's defence-splitting through-ball to level the match once more as the Premier League title race took yet another dramatic twist.

The draw would also see a Liverpool streak of their own brought to an end. Klopp's men had won 10 Premier League matches on the spin prior to their visit to the Etihad, where they were forced to share the spoils. Sunday's stalemate means Guardiola's side remain one point ahead of Liverpool atop the league's summit, with a mere seven matches now left to play.
