Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling for measures to bolster their army and the first NATO country has answered his call. In a brutal blow to Putin and his forces, more than a dozen T-72 tanks and some BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles have been sent to Ukraine in a shipment as a gift agreed with NATO allies. Zelensky said the tanks were needed to aid the besieged cities "that are now dying." Jana Cernochova, the Czech defence minister, told parliament: "I will only assure you that the Czech Republic is helping Ukraine as much as it can and will continue to help by (supplying) military equipment, both light and heavy." Prague's decision will likely increase pressure on NATO allies to follow their lead and announcements on the delivery of more weapons are expected at the landmark summit between nations this afternoon.
