Footage from the Duke of Edinburgh's service shows Princess Beatrice, 33, in floods of tears as her father the Duke of York accompanied the Queen to her seat at Westminster Abbey. The Princess was at one point spotted hiding behind a service sheet, before standing quietly while others around her sang, appearing as if she was trying to hold in tears. The mother of one could then be seen delving into her handbag for a tissue, before hiding her face again. Body language expert Judi James described her actions as “shocking” and “more than a little puzzling”, and noted that it formed a direct contrast to her sister Eugenie’s response. She claims that hiding her face would send out a “very complicated message” as often face hiding can “suggest shame”. Judi told the Mirror: "We saw how Beatrice became overwhelmed by tears after her father arrived with his mother and the Queen had taken her place in front of her, but Beatrice’s response as he first honed into view was equally shocking and more than a little puzzling. "As the Queen and Andrew first walked level with the royals, Eugenie did appear to glance at an angle that meant she could see her father in her peripheral vision. After spotting him though she appeared to turn her gaze forward. "Beatrice, however, seemed to already have her face hidden by her order of service. She performed this total face-covering, shielding ritual after her tears once the Queen and her father were in position, but hiding her face as they walked in would have sent out a very complicated message. "For everyone aware of the sisters’ tendency to loyalty this would have been seen as hiding tears of relief and joy at what looked like his re-appearance in public but when we face-hide we can also suggest shame, making this a risky public gesture.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
