Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, will celebrate their wedding anniversary on Friday. The royal couple got married 11 years ago at Westminster Abbey in front of a congregation of 1,900, and a television audience of nearly 27 million. Kate and William met a decade prior while they were both studying at St Andrew’s University; the pair kept their relationship fairly low-key as they completed their education, but had a high profile split when the Duke was stationed with the Household Cavalry in Dorset and the Duchess stayed in London. Both William and Kate have acknowledged their split publicly, with William insisting they were “trying to find their own way,” at the time.He said: “It was just a bit of space. It worked out for the better.”Meanwhile, Kate has admitted that she “wasn’t very happy” about the break-up at the time, but has since come to realise that it was for the best.Kate said: “At the time I wasn't very happy about it but actually it made me a stronger person. You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realised. JUST IN: ‘Two dignified and strong women!’ Kate and Anne step out on first joint royal engagement “I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger. I really valued that time, for me as well, although I didn't think it at the time.”While Kate has confessed to feeling unhappy at the time, the Duchess did not show it and instead filled up her diary with social events, all the while keeping quiet about her relationship with the prince.One royal expert has claimed that Kate’s handling of the 2007 break-up contributed to her favour within the Royal Family.Kinsey Schofield, founder and creator of ToDiForDaily.com, told Express.co.uk Kate’s stoicism during her split from William made her a “no brainer” for the role of “future Queen”. She said: “Kate was probably a sure thing because, despite being considered a commoner, they [Kate and William] were together for such a significant amount of time.“They [the Royal Family] knew she was a good girl, they knew she wasn’t talking to the media, because in between those break-ups, she was so stoic and kept her mouth shut and in all of the photographs of her during her break up, she’s looking ahead.”Ms Schofield added: “She just handled herself so well throughout the rollercoaster that was her and Prince William’s dating history leading up to their inevitable marriage.“It made Kate a no brainer — she was the future Queen.” DON'T MISS Prince Andrew faces being stripped of major British honour TONIGHT [INSIGHT] Prince Harry 'obsessed' over Prince William 'hogging the best briefs' [REVEAL] 'Leading lady' Meghan Markle 'hated every second' of Royal Family tour [REPORT] The couple only parted ways for around 10 weeks, before getting back together in the summer of 2007.Three years later, William popped the question that both Kate and the British public had been waiting for and the pair became officially engaged.Since their spectacular wedding in 2011, Kate and William have welcomed three children — Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, four. The couple are now deemed the “future of the monarchy” and are seen as the key to a modern Royal Family. In fact, their marriage itself was hugely significant given that Kate, who was born in Reading to parents Carole and Michael Middleton, was a “commoner” without any links to nobility.Ms Schofield, author of the upcoming book, ‘R is For Revenge Dress’, claimed that William’s ability to “marry for love” rather than status came from the influence of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.She said: “I think she [Princess Diana] had a really positive effect on future marriages within the monarchy.“I think because there was so much pressure on Prince Charles to marry Diana by his family —and Charles suffered for that — that he was much more open and accepting of the idea of Prince William and Prince Harry marrying for love.” Ms Schofield added: “Princess Diana thrust open the gates for the boys to marry for love, which I think is so important, because they saw what marrying for status did to Diana and Charles.”Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after years of enduring an unhappy marriage.They had only known each other for six months before getting engaged, and their marriage broke down in part because of their incompatibility.It was witnessing the dissolution of his parents’ relationship that made William reluctant to bow to similar pressure as his father. Royal biographer Katie Nicholl wrote in her book, ‘The Making of a Royal Romance’: “He [William] was aware his father had been pressured into marrying Diana because she was deemed the suitable bride.“He was reluctant to bow to similar pressure and vowed not to be hurried to the altar.”Of course, the wait was seemingly worth it and since their wedding, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have become integral members of the Royal Family, with the pair stepping up amid the Queen’s ill health and the absences of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Andrew and Prince Philip.Their responsibilities within the Firm are set to become more involved as William prepares to take on a new role. When Charles becomes king, William looks set to inherit the Prince of Wales title, and reports suggest that the Duke is planning to reinvent the role held by his father for nearly 64 years.Following backlash surrounding their Caribbean tour, both William and Kate are said to have been thinking about how royal protocol can be modernised.A strategy dubbed the “Cambridge way” will reportedly “rip up the rulebook”.
