In a statement, the fire department said half of a single-storey commercial car dealership is currently alight. The whole of the first floor and the roof of the building are under fire. Ten fire engines and around 70 firefighters have rushed to the spot to tackle the fire.   Station Commander Dave Reed, who is at the scene, said: “The centre section of the building is currently alight and firefighters are working hard to bring the fire under control. “The fire was producing heavy smoke, which went in the direction away from residential properties, but those in the immediate area should keep their windows and doors closed. “Access to Kings Hall Road is limited with road closures in place at the junction of Aldersmead Road and on Bridge Road. We encourage people to avoid the area.” The department said: “The Brigade was called at 0141.   “Fire crews from West Norwood, Bromley, Forest hill, Croydon and surrounding fire stations are at the scene.” The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. As of 5.30am, the firefighters have managed to control the fire at the car dealership. However, the department said the firefighters will remain on scene throughout the morning.
