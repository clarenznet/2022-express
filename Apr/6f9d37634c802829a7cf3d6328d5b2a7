Free benefits like a bus pass, TV licence and financial help towards energy bills could save pensioners thousands of pounds over the course of a year. Some 850,000 pensioners are missing out on Pension Credit which acts as a gateway benefit to these additional freebies. Campaigners are urging pensioners to make sure they are claiming everything they are entitled to. The older age group is the most likely to be losing out on financial help according to Age UK. Pension Credit is available to people who have reached State Pension age if they earn £177 a week or less. In addition, they’ll usually get additional financial support or freebies to help them make ends meet.

While in England, people have to wait until they reach the current State Pension age of 66, in Wales and Scotland it’s 60. Pensioners should automatically qualify once they reach the required age. It’s not just pensioners, who qualify for reduced travel, in total 10 groups of Britons qualify. Millions of Britons on Universal Credit don’t know that they are entitled to a 50 percent discount on train and bus travel. This could be a lifeline for people who are looking for work. Meanwhile, disabled people are also entitled to help towards travel costs. Anyone caring for someone who needs help getting around could also be entitled to a free bus pass depending on where they live. What is happening where you live?
