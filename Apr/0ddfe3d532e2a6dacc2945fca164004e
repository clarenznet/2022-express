The Nobel laureate, 76, is already serving six years for other offences. Yesterday’s case, held behind closed doors, centred on claims she accepted 11.4kg of gold and cash totalling more than £475,000 in bribes. Suu Kyi, forced out of power last year in a coup by a brutal military junta, dismissed the allegations as “absurd”. Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch, said she now faces “a life sentence, given her advanced age.” But defiant Nay Phone Latt, an activist and official in Suu Kyi’s ousted party, insisted: “We do not recognise the terrorist junta’s rulings. This won’t last.”
