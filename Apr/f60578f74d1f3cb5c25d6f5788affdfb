Motsi Mabuse, 41, explained last week that her husband’s Ukrainian parents were now safe after they managed to leave the country. The Strictly Come Dancing star told This Morning that there is a chance they will now live with them “forever” after their house was destroyed during the ongoing war. Motsi went on to explain how she began using her platform to raise awareness about the conflict and help those affected by it. She said: “When it affected my husband I didn’t think it would affect me so much. “Within a day, we’ve got on social media… people are tired of us eating pizza and sushi and content like that. “I raised awareness with candles, selling candles and donating… “We collected food, my husband went to the border and picked up some people and got them out.” However, Motsi acknowledged that there are other people who are still suffering the devastating consequences of the war. The BBC star admitted: “It breaks my heart… I can literally cry. People will do anything. “We are watching from the outside and you think, how can I help?” Holly added: “I’m so pleased your in-laws are with you and are safe.” Earlier this year, Motsi expressed her heartbreak after witnessing her mother-in-law's fear of the chance of a Russian attack. Back in February, the Strictly judge took to Twitter to share her despair for her in-laws' situation while they were still in Ukraine. Motsi posted in view of her 71,300 followers: "It's heartbreaking hearing my mother-in-law crying this morning, afraid. "And there's absolutely nothing we can do! Just sad honestly." The Strictly judge has been married to her partner Evgenij since 2017. The pair wed in an intimate legal ceremony before celebrating a larger wedding in Majorca in 2017. They met back in 2015 at a German Latin Dance contest and the couple share one daughter.
