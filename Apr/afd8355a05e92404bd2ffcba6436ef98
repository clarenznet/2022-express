The Duke of Sussex, who is living in California with Meghan Markle after quitting royal duties, was made chief impact officer at mental health firm BetterUp last March. But the Silicon Valley company is facing an uprising with staff reportedly furious about a proposed payment restructure, which coaches claimed was effectively a "sneaky pay cut". One coach told the Daily Beast: “This is the way capitalism I suppose works. But for a company [whose] mission is to help empower people throughout the world… They’re not walking the walk." None of the coaches were clear about Harry's role at the firm, according to the website. One said: "They hired and hired and hired…over the past couple of years. They have so many VPs. Now, I don't even know what these VPs do." Staff reportedly questioned how meaningful Prince Harry's role, wondering whether it is marketing “smoke and mirrors”. The company, which is valued at $5bn, said it was working to modify its payment plans, according to the Daily Beast. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
