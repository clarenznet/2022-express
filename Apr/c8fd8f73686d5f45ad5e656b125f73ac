This comes amid increasing concerns over the Queen's health, with the monarch having most recently pulled out of attending the Maundy Thursday Service. Speaking to the Mirror, a source close to the Sussexes said: "Both the Duke and Duchess are very mindful the Queen is getting older and has had health issues associated with her great age. "They have made it clear they are certainly planning to return to see the Queen with their family in the near future." This would give the 95-year-old monarch the opportunity to meet her granddaughter Lilibet for the first time. Meghan and Harry covertly visited the Queen at Windsor on Thursday, marking the first time the couple have returned to the UK as a pair since they stepped back from royal duties in March 2020.
