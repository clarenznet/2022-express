Conservationists found too that species in a Panamanian protected rainforest fell by at least half between 1977 and 2020. Researchers noted a decline in 40 species in the tropics while 35 of them lost at least half of their numbers. Only the hummingbird and puffbird rose. Study lead author Dr Henry Pollock, of the University of Illinois in the US, said: "At the beginning of the study in 1977, we'd catch 10 or 15 of many species. By 2020, for a lot of species, that would be down to five or six individuals." Fewer birds could threaten tree reproduction and regeneration, affecting the structure of the forest, a pattern shown elsewhere after major bird declines, conservationists warn. The research team has yet to study the causes for the decline or its impact. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
