One of the greatest boxers of his generation, Tyson Fury puts his unblemished record on the line against Dillian Whyte as the pair battle it out for the WBC and 'The Ring' heavyweight titles. The 31-0-1 superstar has hinted Saturday's showdown at Wembley Stadium could be the last of his career, suggesting he has more than enough money in the bank But just how much has the 'Gypsy King' stashed in his treasury over the years? Climbing from a first-round knockout win over Bala Gyongyosi in his Nottingham debut 14 years ago, he'll headline a packed-out Wembley in one of the year's must-watch fights. Fury, 33, told BT Sport in March that he'll have "earned over £100million" from fights following his bout with Whyte. The all-British affair promises to be the most lucrative of his career, too, with an 80 per cent share of the purse expected to add around $30million (£23m) to his bank balance. His boxing career doesn't account for his many other ventures, however, such as sales from his two books, merchandise or his recently released Furocity energy drink. It's also believed the WWE paid Fury somewhere in the region of £12m for a handful of in-ring appearances against Braun Strowman in 2019.

It's understood he earned closer to £18m the first time he beat the 'Bronzer Bomber' in February 2020, while the controversial draw in December 2018 saw him rake in around £8m. Fury accepted a smaller contract offer to face Wilder for the WBC crown despite the fact he'd had similar paydays in the past. Specifically, his 2014 collision with Derek Chisora—when he retired his foe in the 10th round—was also believed to have netted him around £8m, a year before he was paid £5m following victory over Wladimir Klitschko. Despite almost three years passing before he returned to the ring, Fury maintained his allure when he came back for a pair of tune-ups in 2018. He claimed he was paid £5m apiece for each of his encounters against Sefer Seferi (fourth-round retirement) and Francesco Pianeta (points).

As we now know, those figures went through the roof for the following two fights against Wilder, and the rest is history. The Gypsy King has acknowledged the "half-a-billion" sum predecessor Mike Tyson allegedly flew through during his hayday but said he doesn't live the same kind of 'big flash lifestyle.' That won't be for a lack of options, at least, as Fury eyes a potential career sign-off with his highest-paying punch-up to date.
