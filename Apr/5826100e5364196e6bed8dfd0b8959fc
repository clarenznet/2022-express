The thugs threw objects at riot police in Caia Park, Wrexham, when a demo "quickly escalated" at around 11.40pm. A large group had gathered on the estate to protestÂ against an individual they wrongly thought to be present there. North Wales Police are now working with the council to help reassure the community. Speaking today, Superintendent Nick Evans said: "Sadly last night we were called to deal with a situation where a number of people gathered in Wynnstay Avenue to protest against an individual they wrongly thought to be present there. "Whilst everyone has a right to peaceful protest, this incident resulted in wholly unacceptable behaviour which included items being thrown at officers. Whilst thankfully none were hurt, cars and property were damaged. "The actions of those involved have understandably caused a lot of distress locally and we will be working in partnership with our council colleagues to reassure the wider Caia Park community that their safety is our priority and we will do all we can to prevent this happening again.

The force say the scenes, which happened on a suburban estate where many young families live, began as a demonstration. Ian Bancroft, chief executive with Wrexham Council, said: "We would like to reassure the community that we will be working with North Wales Police in response to this incident as they continue their investigations. It is not appropriate for us to comment on any individuals involved." An investigation has commenced into the offences committed last night and we would appeal to anyone with information to contact us via the website or via 101.
