Its blind taste tests judged supermarket labels more flavourful than their famous counterparts in six out of eight essential items. The results come as households face rising food prices with the cost-of-living crunch biting hard. Nearly £100 a year can be saved on orange juice alone by switching from Innocent, which came bottom of the taste test, to Aldi's version.  And those who buy two tins of baked beans a week could be more than £70 richer by ditching Heinz for Lidl's brand. A £51.60-a-year saving can be made by swapping Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal for Aldi's offering and £9.90 by buying Lidl's peanut butter instead of Sun-Pat. Shoppers can hold on to another £10 by picking Lidl's chocolate hazelnut spread over Nutella and £5 by choosing Aldi's yeast extract, which came top for deliciousness, over Marmite. Big-brand Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Nescafe Original Instant Coffee could not be beaten for taste. But households can save £3.85 on a jar of instant by taking Aldi's instead of Nescafe. And opting for Sainsbury's ketchup rather than Heinz saves £1.70. Natalie Hitchins, of Which?, said: "Those prepared to switch to a cheaper supermarket will likely find some great value alternatives, with many even beating their well-known rivals for taste."
