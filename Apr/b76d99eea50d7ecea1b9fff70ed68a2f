Jade Jagger stunned last night as she partied with her father, Sir Mick Jagger's girlfriend, Melanie Hardwick. The jewellery designer, 50, was all smiles as she cosied up to her rockstar father's younger girlfriend, 35, at an event hosted by aesthetics doctor and skincare entrepreneur Barbara Sturm last night. Jade dazzled as she posed for snaps in a dark emerald, crushed velvet dress which hugged her incredible figure. She wore her naturally chestnut tresses in soft curls that fell around her shoulders. Jade rocked the quirky nature of the maxi dress which cinched her in at the waist and flashed her shoulder thanks to its unique design. The star accessorised with a matching green pendant necklace and a jewelled set of earrings.
