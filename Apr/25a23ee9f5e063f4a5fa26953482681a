The ex-footballer is said to have searched for the thief at the seven-bed home they bought for £30million in 2013. The couple’s son Cruz, 17, raised the alarm after he saw a broken window and found a spare room ransacked.  Designer and electrical goods worth thousands were stolen while CCTV filmed a masked intruder climbing over a gate. Scotland Yard said the break-in in Kensington was “very upsetting” for the family. No arrests have been made.
