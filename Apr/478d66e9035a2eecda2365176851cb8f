Max Verstappen won his second Grand Prix of the new season with a commanding victory ahead of Sergio Perez at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on Sunday. The Dutchman managed to hold off the threat of Charles Leclerc, who ultimately slipped down to sixth place after a late brush with the barriers, and never looked back to clinch the maximum total of 26 points after setting the fastest lap of the afternoon. Red Bull brought a number of upgrades to Imola and proved to be quicker than Ferrari over the course of the entire weekend as a result of their hard work behind the scenes. They will need to steer clear of any further reliability issues over the next few races, though, to stand the best chance of joining their Italian rivals near the top of the Constructors' Championship table in the near future. Meanwhile, it was another disastrous afternoon for Lewis Hamilton, who was condemned to a lowly 13th-placed finish after failing to make up any positions before the end of the contest. He was embarrassingly lapped by Verstappen during the closing stages of the race and is now almost certain to miss out on another Drivers' Championship title at the end of the campaign as a result of the German outfit's early-season struggles.
