Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has been slammed for suggesting the Prime Minister's partygate fines are no worse than a parking or speeding fine. Responding to the Tory MP's defence of the Prime Minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: "I have never had anybody break down in front of me because they couldn’t drive at 35mph in a 30mph zone; I have had no end of people in tears - in real bits - about complying with rules that really, really hurt them." This sentiment was echoed by Green MP Caroline Lucas, she said: "Oh spare us Brandon Lewis - have some self respect & stop trying to defend PM. 'If someone gets a speeding ticket …I’m not in any way trying to equate a speeding ticket with sacrifices people made.' That’s exactly what you’re doing & trashing decency in public life." The Prime Minister will deliver a speech at 3pm to the Commons as calls mount for him to resign after receiving a 'partygate' fine. A Downing Street source told the Telegraph that Mr Johnson will "offer a full-throated apology and recognise the strength of feeling" among MPs. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
