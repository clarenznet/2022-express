Fans of The Wanted singer struggled to hold back their tears during Tom’s posthumous appearance on Pointless Celebrities, which aired on Saturday night. The BBC had made the decision to reschedule the charity special episode in tribute to the late singer. After being diagnosed with brain cancer, the pair went on to play for The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Research UK, hoping to raise awareness for the cause. The broadcaster planned to air the episode after his death was announced on Wednesday (April 2) and viewers tuned in to see the father of two take on Alexander Armstrong’s quiz show. Later in the programme, audiences were delighted to see the duo went on to win the £2,500 jackpot for their chosen charities. Taking to Twitter, fans shared their heartbreak, with one user @nathsvictory saying: “Just look how happy he was to win @TVsPointless@richardosman@XanderArmstrong.” The continued: “This meant the absolute world to @TomParker to raise money for brain cancer and brain tumours #weloveyoutom @MaxGeorge #RIPTomParker.

"He fought until the very end, I’m forever proud of you,” she said. Tom, Max, Siva Kaneswaran, Nathan Sykes and Jay McGuiness formed The Wanted in 2009 and they had UK number one singles, Glad You Came and All Time Low, with eight other top 10 hits including Chasing The Sun, Heart Vacancy and Lightning.
