Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake has led calls for Lord Frost to give up his peerage and stand in the Wakefield by-election. The by-election will be a litmus test to see whether Boris Johnson’s party can hold on to the so-called Red Wall seats won from Labour in the 2019 General Election. Referring to Lord Frost, Mr Hollinrake told The Mail on Sunday: "I worked with him in the Cabinet Office and I have the highest regard for him on a personal level." The Conservative Party is currently defending a narrow 3,358-vote majority in the Wakefield constituency. Meanwhile Boris Johnson has been urged to cut post-Brexit red tape that is placing 40,000 UK jobs at risk. The Prime Minister has been warned by the Tourism Alliance that there has been a decrease in bookings from foreign schools from the EU visiting the UK. This is because every child from the EU entering the country must possess a passport and have a £95 visa. Kurt Janson, the director of the Tourism Alliance told The Guardian: “The collapse in the school group market is unnecessary as schoolchildren present no security risk, will not disappear into the black economy and start driving minicabs, and parents who let their children go on school trips are generally quite keen for their teachers to bring them back home.  “This is an obvious situation where the government needs to set aside its dogma on passports and work with the industry to find a practical solution.” Prior to Brexit, an estimated 1.5 million children came to the UK each year using identity cards under the List of Travellers scheme. The extra post-Brexit red tape installed by the Government could place at least 40,000 jobs in the language school industry at risk. FOLLOW MORE UPDATES BELOW
