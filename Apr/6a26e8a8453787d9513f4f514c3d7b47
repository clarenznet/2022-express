The Duchess of Sussex has returned to Montecito, California, to be reunited with her children, Archie, who turns three next month, and Lili, who turns one in June. Harry and Meghan have spent the weekend in the Netherlands for the Invictus Games but the Duchess confessed she missed her children at a book reading in Zuiderpark. The return comes as Meghan's half-sister Samantha Markle announced she wants to “resolve the conflict” between them. Samantha, whom last month attempted to sue the Duchess for defamation, said: "If you are a humanitarian and a compassionate person and all these things you claim to be, you listen to your family and you try to think, 'what do we need to do to have a meeting of the minds? Let's resolve conflicts, let's be adults about this and let's show that we are bigger people'." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
