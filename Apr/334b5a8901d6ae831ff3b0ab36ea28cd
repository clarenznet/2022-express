The Manchester United star, 37, posted on social media that his son died but a daughter survived. He had told fans last October he was due to become a dad to twins with his partner Georgina Rodriguez. But in an Instagram post, Cristiano said: "It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away." "It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel." "Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness." "We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time." "Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you." The striker's club, Manchester United, added: "Your pain is our pain. Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time." His sister Katia Aveiro shared an emotional open letter that also referred to their father Dinis who died of liver failure in September 2005. She told the couple in a message posted from her home in Brazil: "May God take care of you and strengthen your path more and more." "Our angel is already on father's lap. And our little girl is there firm and strong and full of health and is going to show us with every day that only love matters." She also posted pictures of Georgina and Cristiano with her two children. Dinis passed away aged just 52 after drinking himself into an early grave. Cristiano was only 20 when he died. It was unclear last night where Georgina was after it was reported earlier in the year she was due to give birth at a private Madrid hospital. The reports said the 28-year-old had placed her trust again in University Hospital Quironsalud Madrid near to their home in the gated estate of La Finca. Cristiano has three boys and also with Georgina a daughter aged four.
