This was up 9 percent on the previous week and the highest peak since mid-February, the Office for National Statistics said.  Deaths had levelled off in March. Some 4.1 million in England were estimated to have had Covid in the week to April 2, unchanged from the week before. Deaths often lag behind the trend in infections as patients deteriorate over time. In total 170,395 have died within 28 days of a positive test.
