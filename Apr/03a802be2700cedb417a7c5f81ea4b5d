Sir Rod Stewart, 77, showed off his impressive level of fitness by sprinting back and forth during a gruelling 15 metre bleep test. Rod shared a video on Instagram of him running laps across a football pitch in preparation for his upcoming tour. The rocker had a knee replacement and ankle fusion surgery in 2020 to repair decades of injuries caused by playing football. Despite vowing his “football days are over” last year, Rod insists he is now in top shape. He captioned the video shared to his 1.1 million Instagram followers: “After a knee replacement and angle fusion surgery, at 77 I'm back to top fitness in preparation for my long-awaited tour dates - and maybe a call-up Scotland! “Full speed ahead, bring on the tour!” Barely breaking a sweat in the clip, Rod finished his lap and triumphantly said he was “not bad for 77”, before lifting his arms up in celebration. Rod’s tour kicks off in Las Vegas this summer before returning to the UK in November.
