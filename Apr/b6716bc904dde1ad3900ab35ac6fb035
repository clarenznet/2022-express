Alex Wade, legal partner at Wiggin LLP, said the trial was the actor's "last throw of the dice" career-wise. Depp is suing Heard, 35, for libel over a 2018 article she wrote in The Washington Post, which his lawyers say falsely implies he physically and sexually abused her. It comes after the actor, 58, lost a similar case in the UK, which he brought against News Group Newspapers. As the first week of the US trial concluded, Mr Wade said: "This is absolutely his last throw of the dice. If he loses this it's impossible to see him making a comeback, I think, as an actor. "Hollywood likes a bad boy, absolutely, but in the wake of #MeToo, the way in which we view these things in today's world is that you can't just be a bit of a bad boy anymore. "This is abuse. This is active misogyny. I find it very difficult to see how a Hollywood studio would employ Depp again if he loses." Mr Wade said Depp "needs a rabbit out of a hat" but it was "possible" that his large legal team - several of whom have flanked him at court - had one to produce. The seven-week trial continues on Monday at the Fairfax County District Courthouse in Virginia.
