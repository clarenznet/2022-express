The Duchess of Sussex has spoken of her "heartbreak" following the death of a close friend, Oli Juste, a dog trainer and animal behaviouralist who first introduced her to the Mayhew animal charity which she later became a patron of. In her letter Meghan, who became patron of the shelter in 2019, lamented that his death had left her "heartbroken and reflective", adding: "We shared, amongst many things, a commitment to animal welfare, and a deep love of rescue dogs." Her heartfelt address comes as Prince Harry addressed the Invictus Games competitors, marking his first public appearance since missing Prince Philip's memorial service. The athletes were surprised by the call from the Duke, with vice-captain Kelly Leonard saying: "I was nearly in tears when he gave us a team talk. It was really rousing. The message was about what Invictus is about, that resilience and that journey. It was really wonderful to see him." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
