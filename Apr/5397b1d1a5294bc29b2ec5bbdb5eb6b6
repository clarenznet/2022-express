Now the gloves are off. Yesterday Mr Biden pulled no punches, saying: "We have to gather all the details so this can be... a war crime trial. This guy is brutal." Then and now, the POTUS was absolutely correct. While Russia's assault on Ukraine has been horrific since it began, it took the weekend's deadly evidence from the towns of Bucha and Irpin to really bring home the sickening depths of violence committed by Putin's forces. Both Mr Biden and Boris Johnson are right to say that more sanctions now urgently need to be applied. In fighting spirit, Mr Johnson vowed Putin would "never break the spirit of Ukraine's people or conquer their homeland". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, speaking from neighbouring Poland, said more heavy weaponry should be sent to help rid Ukraine of its Russian occupiers. Meanwhile, the brave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Bucha, calling the killings "real genocide". This is not just an escalation in rhetoric. The Russian army has retreated in the north but has opened up a southern front and still occupies huge swathes of Ukraine. There remains an urgent need to restock Ukraine's defences. The sickening discoveries of Bucha and Irpin show what Ukraine is fighting for - and we should help in every way that we can. In its various forms, dementia is one of our most intractable diseases. Affecting around 850,000 in the UK, awareness has grown and it is taken more seriously. But there has been no cure. Now comes a glimmer of light. A study has discovered 42 new genes that influence the risk of Alzheimers, raising the number of risky genes from 33 to 75. The study, which compared the genomes of more than 100,000 people with Alzheimer's, is the largest to date and it will influence clinical activity and drug science. Let's hope that in time, doctors will be able to nip this debilitating disease in the bud.
