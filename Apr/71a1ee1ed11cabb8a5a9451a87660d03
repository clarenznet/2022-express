Becker faces a sentencing hearing that could see him jailed for up to seven years for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy. Earlier this month, the German was found guilty of transferring hundreds of thousands of pounds from his business account and failing to declare a property in his hometown of Leimen. The 54-year-old was also convicted of hiding a £693,000 (€825,000) bank loan and 75,000 shares in a tech firm. Each offence under the Insolvency Act carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. Becker was dressed smartly in a suit as he made his way to court, where he will be sentenced by Judge Deborah Taylor. The six-time Grand Slam champion sported a Wimbledon-branded navy blue and green tie.

He went on to win a further two Championships and became the world No 1 in 1991. Becker also twice won the Australian Open and lifted the US Open. His final Grand Slam came in 1996. Becker has provided commentary and punditry for the BBC at the Championship for several years.  However, he was declared bankrupt in 2017. Jurors were told that an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara Becker, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments', had swallowed up most of his career earnings of around £38million. He said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt over an unpaid loan of more than £3m on his estate in Spain. He claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker was found guilty of four charges.
