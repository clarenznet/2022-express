Months have passed since No Time To Die hit cinemas with Daniel Craig’s explosive exit from the 007 film franchise. As the back catalogue returns to cinemas to celebrate 60 years of James Bond movies, fans are wondering who will be the next to take up the Licence to Kill. Among the favourites, there are now a couple of Downton Abbey actors who have been given odds by the bookies. According to William Hill, Barrow star Rob James-Collier is now on 66-1 to be cast as the next Bond. The 45-year-old had a brief stint on Coronation Street as Liam Connor before bagging the role of the prominent servant in Downton Abbey. A spokesperson for the bookies said: “Rob James-Collier would be a solid fit for the role of James Bond, as his impressive credentials yet relative obscurity mean he could really make his own mark on the prestigious role. Any leading actor who’s set to appear on the silver screen this year could be a contender, as 007 needs to be someone who’s fairly popular and very talented - just like Rob.” DON'T MISSJames Bond: Sean Connery wanted Roger Moore in Never Say Never Again [SEAN CONNERY]Sean Connery 'hated directors': Michael Bay 'so scared' of Bond star [JAMES BOND]James Bond: Roger Moore drank for his nerves on For Your Eyes Only set [ROGER MOORE] The Salford-born Rob is also a model who won Sexist Male twice at the British Soap Awards. Just a bit ahead of him in the next Bond odds is fellow Downton Abbey star Allen Leech on 50-1, who plays Branson in the period drama. Right at the front of the pack are Regé-Jean Page on 7-1, Henry Cavill on 7-2 and Michael Fassbender on 5-1. All this should be taken with a pinch of salt, but you never know who the Bond producers will audition.
