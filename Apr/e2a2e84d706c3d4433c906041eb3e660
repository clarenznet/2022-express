Eclair Surf has sadly become the fourth horse to lose their life as a result of the Grand National after it was announced on Sunday morning that the eight-year-old had passed away. Eclair Surf fell at the third fence at Aintree, and was transferred to Liverpool University's equine hospital. The horse had sustained serious injuries, and his trainer Emma Lavelle took to social media to write: "We are very sad to report that having sustained a traumatic head injury in yesterdays Grand National, Eclair Surf lost his fight this morning. The news comes after Solwara One, Elle Est Belle and Discorama also died over the course of the four-day festival. It has led to renewed calls from animal charities for tightened rules around races. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Director Elisa Allen told the Daily Mail: "There's no such thing as a "harmless flutter", as horses often pay with their lives. Eclair Surf's death was predictable and avoidable, and it's proof - not that any more was needed - that the Grand National must be put out to pasture. "If human high jumpers or runners died like this in competitions, organisers and trainers would be charged with murder, yet people still place bets on horse races and turn a blind eye to the hideous abuse these sensitive animals are subjected to.  "The horses aren't volunteers: they're forced to jump over hazardous obstacles and run at breakneck speeds around a course that is deliberately and recklessly designed to be dangerous. "The exhausted animals are pushed to - and past - their breaking point to line bookies' pockets, and when they become too sick or old to be profitable, many are slaughtered for food. "Anyone considering betting on horse races should think of Eclair Surf and refuse to support an industry built on cruelty and death."
