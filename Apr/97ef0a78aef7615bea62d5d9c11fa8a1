The Labour leader stood by Fabian Hamilton after his remarks at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally in 2019 came to light. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the shadow minister for peace and disarmament should be sacked for "siding" with Vladimir Putin. But Labour insiders said Sir Keir was not expected to discipline the MP, with a source adding: "Keir Starmer voted for the renewal of Trident and has been clear that the Labour Party's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent is non-negotiable."  A video shows Mr Hamilton telling the rally that Russian hackers could already hijack the Trident software. He added: "I'd be quite happy about that." He also argued there was "never a better time" for the UK to give up its nuclear weapons. Mr Wallace said: "It is one thing to disagree with the UK's possession of nuclear weapons, but to take the side of a man who has deployed chemical weapons and who is responsible for bombing civilians in Ukraine is treasonous. "He is bordering on encouraging criminal activity - a dangerous man who is putting ideology above our public safety." Mr Wallace said it was a fresh test of leadership after Sir Keir failed to sack deputy Angela Rayner last year for calling Tories "scum". Calling Mr Wallace's remarks "ludicrous", a spokesman for Mr Hamilton said: "Labour's historic commitment to our nuclear deterrent is steadfast. Putin's illegal and unprovoked war in Ukraine cannot be allowed to turn nuclear."
