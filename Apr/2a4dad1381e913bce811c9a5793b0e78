Styles had wedding bells ring out before his 80-minute set in which he performed duets with Twain of her hits Man! I Feel Like A Woman and You're Still The One. The 28-year-old took to the stage in an array of outfits, including a spangly jumpsuit, to wow the 60,000 fans in California on Friday night. Styles got emotional as he paid tribute to Twain for "the memories you gave me with my mother" learning to sing on car journeys. He also performed new tunes from his upcoming album Harry's House. Styles said: "I have to tell you that in the car with my mother as a child, this lady taught me to sing. She also taught me that men are trash. "But to you for the memories you gave me with my mother I will be forever grateful. I am so grateful you are here tonight. This is very special for me." Twain said: "I am a bit starstruck. It is kind of a dream and very surreal."
