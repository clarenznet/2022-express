Florian Philippot blasted the freshly re-elected French President over his decision to provide Ukraine with artillery in order to support its defence against Russia. Mr Philippot, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, said of Mr Macron that he “obviously wants war” and that he is committing a “serious mistake”. He wrote on this Twitter account: “France's delivery of offensive weapons to Ukraine, such as powerful cannons, is a serious mistake that places us in the position of almost cobelligerent! “Irresponsible, crazy! Macron obviously wants war!” In a later Tweet, the President of Les Patriotes pointed to the French army's capabilities and claimed that there is no capacity to support Ukraine. He said: “The very expensive military equipment that we send to Ukraine, we take it from which army? “The French army is already in hardship! “Our leaders are completely crazy!” Subsequently, Mr Phillipot reacted to the news of the rouble hitting a two-year high over the euro. The Russian rouble clipped a more than two-year high against the euro in early trade on Tuesday before stabilising near Monday's close.
