Charles Leclerc has been summoned to the stewards at 11:55 BST (20:55 local time) just hours after claiming pole position for tomorrow's race. The championship leader has been told he must report to the stewards immediately after a possible infraction early in qualifying. The report claims Leclerc was too slow on his in-lap in the early stages of Q1. It reads: “The driver and team representative is required to report to the Stewards at 20:55, in relation to the incident below. Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and noncompliance with Race Director’s Event Notes 4, driving unnecessarily slowly on an inlap at 16:09.” Alpha Tauri’s Yuki Tsunoda has also been summoned for driving too slowly. In his pre-race notes, race director Niels Wittich had warned drivers not to slow down too much after setting a time in practice and qualifying.

To ensure this, drivers were told they must follow a “maximum time set by the FIA” between the two safety car lines. He said: “In order to ensure that cars are not driven unnecessarily slowly on in laps during and after the end of qualifying or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for the race, drivers must stay below the maximum time set by the FIA between the Safety Car lines shown on the pit lane map. You will be informed of the maximum time after the first day of practice.” Confusion on the in-laps caused carnage on Saturday morning's qualifying session with a mix-up between Nicholas Latifi and Lance Stroll causing a collision. Latifi had slowed on the exit of turn four to let Stroll through believing he was on a hot lap.

The initial confusion saw Stroll drive straight into the side of Latifi, destroying the Williams. Stroll has been handed a three-place grid penalty for tomorrow's race after being blamed by the stewards. After the session, Leclerc said: “It felt good, I mean even more [because] it’s a track where I have always struggled in the past; as a driver it probably doesn’t fit me as well and this weekend we really worked. “It was a bit messy for the free practice session for me, I managed to do some good laps but not everything together and in Q3 I managed to put everything together. It feels great, and very happy to be on pole tomorrow."
