The Duke of Sussex appeared as the assembled crowd cheered, speaking to athletes via videolink. He joked with the rows of competitors, a welcome surprise for Team UK ahead of the Games in the Hague. The Help for Heroes Twitter account wrote: Ahead of the @InvictusGamesNL #TeamUK received a very special surprise from the founding patron Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex!" The Games have been two years in the making, delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and use "the power of sport to inspire recovery" for injured servicemen and women. They will run from Saturday, April 16 until Friday, April 22. Prince Harry, a driving force behind the Games, said before the first Games: "I have witnessed first-hand how the power of sport can positively impact the lives of wounded, injured and sick Servicemen and women in their journey of recovery."  He commented ahead of the inaugural London event in 2014: "I am extremely proud that we are bringing an event like this to the UK for the first time and believe it can have a long lasting impact on the well-being of those who have served their nations so bravely.” He told those competing on the video call: "As far as I'm concerned, you've already won gold by just getting to this point. "The fact that you are sitting there now wearing that strip, and you're able to wear the union jack on your arm again - that means so much to every single one of you." MORE TO FOLLOW...
