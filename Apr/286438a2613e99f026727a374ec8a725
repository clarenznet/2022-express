Ed Jackson, 33, has weakness or paralysis in all four of his limbs. The former rugby player, from Bath, set off on the ascent of Himlung Himal, Nepal, with fellow paraplegic Ben Halms, 33. Ed, who was injured diving into a pool, said: "I want to encourage more people to break out of the narrative that they can't do things and realise their potential." Ben, an ex-soldier, was injured when his parachute failed to deploy properly. He said: "This was more than just an expedition for me. "It has given me something to focus on and to work towards during a difficult time. It has given me hope." The bid to break the record for men with their condition was organised by charity Millimetres 2 Mountains Foundation, founded by Ed and his wife Lois.
