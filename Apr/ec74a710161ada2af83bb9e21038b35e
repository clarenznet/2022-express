With his recent comment to NBC's Today regarding ensuring Her Majesty is "protected" and surrounded by the "right people", Prince Harry is believed to have hit out at the Queen's closest advisers who helped thrash out the terms of the exit from the Firm as senior royals of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a process which became known as Megxit. Meghan Markle and Harry announced in January 2020 they intended to create a new role for themselves within the Royal Family - which would have seen them becoming financially independent from the Sovereign Grant while still representing the Queen and the Crown through engagements and patronages - but their solution was reportedly not deemed workable. They eventually stepped down as full-time working members of the Firm and had to renounce carrying out royal duties as well as their military and royal patronages. A source told The Sun: "The protection comment is perceived to refer to the way he thinks the Queen is ill-advised by those around her, particularly during the Megxit Sandringham Summit." Prince Harry, who did not elaborate on whom he believes are the "right people" to surround the Queen or what she needs protection from, called some of the aides who were involved in the Megxit process "vipers" in the past, the publication has claimed.
