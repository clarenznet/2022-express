Neville said: "They just need to get to a point whereby football basically stops and then they can reset and they can get a new manager into the club. "But that isn't just going to be the answer.This has been going on for a long time now, this type of feeling. "I feel quite low today, not in an angry way, there's times in the past where I've felt angry. I feel quite low tonight having watched that performance because I feel as though another season has drifted away. "It has been poor all season, before Ralf Rangnick it was terrible, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer couldn't get anything out of these players. Ralf Rangnick's struggling to get performances out of them now."

But he refused to speak about the process of appointing a new manager. Rangnick said: "As long as it is possible mathematically, it is possible. But no matter how likely it might be, it's our job and our duty, for ourselves and our supporters, for everybody, to do our very best to finish off the season on the best possible note. "That means now preparing for an away game at Everton, to try to win that. The picture for me is pretty clear [on the managerial situation]. "Not only now but also a couple of weeks ago, and internally, we spoke about that already but there is nothing else I can say at this stage."
