Sanda Bullock, 57, and Channing Tatum, 41, exchanged friendly looks as they posed together at the premiere of The Lost City in London. The glitzy event took place in the capital’s Leicester Square on Thursday, with the film’s co-stars showing off their glamorous outfits. Channing, who was wearing an all-black suit and turtleneck combination, could be seen posing with his hand around Sandra’s waist. The actress opted for a chic trouser suit with a statement pink, red and purple cape wrapped around her waist. She finished off the look with some patent black stilettos that enhanced her svelte legs. The Ocean’s 8 star styled her long, naturally curly hair in a middle parting that framed her features. She opted for her staple smokey eye and a nude lip, complemented with a touch of blush.
