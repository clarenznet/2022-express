The volcano had been dormant for centuries, but began to rumble ominously in 1812. On April 5, 1815, it roared into life, with an explosion loud enough to be heard 800 miles away. Far worse was to come, however, and on April 10 it exploded so violently that those on Sumatra - 1,600 miles away - thought they heard gunfire. Tambora was turned into a mass of "liquid fire". More than 4,000 feet disappeared off the top of the volcano.   For the islanders it was cataclysmic, with around 10,000 dying instantly. But the damage was far from over. Tambora had spewed out 12 cubic miles of magma, as well as hurling 36 cubic miles of rock high into the atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide mixing with water vapour led to a haze of ash and dust around the globe. Periods of unseasonably cold weather in the Northern hemisphere followed and 1816 was known as "the year without a summer". From China to the US, harvests failed and livestock died. Virginia had snowfall in June. In Europe, Ireland experienced eight weeks of solid rain and crops failed across the continent. Famine led to riots and looting in many European cities. Vivid sunsets continued for two and a half years after the explosion. Tambora may be less well known than notorious Krakatoa, which erupted 900 miles away in 1883, but it was 10 times more powerful. That said, another Indonesian volcano outdoes them both.  The "supervolcano" Lake Toba eruption, which took place 75,000 years ago, ejected 17 times the amount of debris as Tambora, and more than 60 times that of Krakatoa. Last week I asked: Which US singer and film star, born April 3, 1922, had her screen debut in Romance On The High Seas? DORIS DAY. Question: On this day in 2019, scientists working on the Event Horizon telescope said they had taken the first picture of what? Also on this day: 1912: Titanic sets sail on her ill-fated voyage. 1970: Paul McCartney announces he is leaving The Beatles. 1998: The Good Friday agreement is signed in Northern Ireland.
