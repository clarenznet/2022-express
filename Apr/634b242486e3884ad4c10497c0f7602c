Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said in a blog post on Monday that "according to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs" in the Russian capital. Hundreds of mainly Western companies announced their suspension of operation or their departure from Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine in February. Mr Sobyanin wrote that they're seeking to implement a plan to "improve the sustainability of the capital's economy." Namely, addressing "employees of foreign companies that have temporarily suspended their activities or decided to leave Russia." He said a newly approved programme plans to support more than 58,000 people who have lost their jobs in foreign firms. But many have said the full impact on Russia's economy is yet to be seen and will only get worse. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
