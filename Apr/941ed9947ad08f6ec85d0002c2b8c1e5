Stacey Solomon, 32, joked that Joe Swash, 40, was left “fuming" when she shared a “dramatic” video of herself making a cup of tea. In the arty clip, Stacey said that she had a “long morning” involving the school run and looking after baby Rose. The video featured a slowed-down version of Beyonce’s hit, Halo, covered by Sam Tompkins. In the caption, Stacey told her 5.1 million Instagram followers: “Seems dramatic but I take my first cuppa very seriously. “Especially when there is a moment where I can drink it alone AND while it’s hot! Happy Friyay everyone.” Once Joe heard the music, Stacey said he thought it was “an emotional post about him or the kids”.
