A poll of 2,000 adults has revealed the nation's spending priorities. Around 35 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, known as Gen Z, plan to spend more on insurance - compared to just 11 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds.  The younger generation are also four times more likely to insure jewellery than 55- to 64-year-olds, and twice as likely to protect their watch. Claudio Gienal, CEO at AXA UK and Ireland which commissioned the research, said: "The cost-of-living crisis has understandably made many people nervous about what lies ahead. "In these uncertain times it's interesting that younger age groups are most likely to protect their goods via insurance. "This suggests they see insurance as a vital safety net which allows them to get on with their life."
