Daniel Ricciardo apologised to Carlos Sainz after the pair came together at the Tamburello on the opening corner of the race. Ricciardo said he had to be ‘accountable’ for ruining Sainz’s race but stressed it was down to the ‘tricky conditions’ in Imola. Ricciardo’s front right tyre made contact with Sainz’s rear left, putting the Spaniard into a spin. The McLaren driver was able to continue but Sainz was out on the spot, bringing out the safety car. Despite recovering, Ricciardo was unable to make much progress after the incident and finished the race 18th and last of the runners. It was a stark contrast to team-mate Lando Norris who secured a podium after Charles Leclerc’s late spin. Ricciardo said: “As soon as I hit him, I saw him spinning and it's not fun. It ruined my race, but also his. I obviously have to be accountable for that. I don't think it was something where I was all locked up and just kind of ploughed into him – it was tricky conditions.

He said: “Immediately after the race, you could see he had a tough one, but the first thing that he did was come to the Ferrari box and apologise to me.
