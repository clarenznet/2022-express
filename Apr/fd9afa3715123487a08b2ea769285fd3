Dennis Quaid, 62, was accompanied by his wife Laura Savoie, 29, as he walked the red carpet at the 2022 CMT Music Awards. The event, which celebrates country music videos and television performances, took place at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville. The couple looked fabulous in their colour-coordinated outfits, with Dennis sporting a black outfit with a silver dinner jacket combination. The Far From Heaven star finished off the stylish look with shiny silver shoes which featured geometrical patterns. Laura opted for an all-black ensemble consisting of a spaghetti strap top with flare pants, which she paired with heeled sandals. She wore her long blonde tresses down over her shoulders and chose a natural makeup look featuring light brown eye makeup. The couple began dating in May 2019 and married in June last year in Santa Barbara, California.
