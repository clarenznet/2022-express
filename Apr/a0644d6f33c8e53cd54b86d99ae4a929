The weekend is finally here, alongside a brand new Wordle puzzle for Saturday, April 23. Recent Wordle puzzles have been fairly tricky, although anybody using Express Online's spoiler-free hints should be sitting on a pretty lengthy winning streak. Indeed, if you need help with today's brain teaser, just head to the bottom of the page for Wordle 308 hints. Good luck! Wordle tasks players with figuring out a five letter word in just six attempts. Sounds simple, but it can be a lot harder than you think. If you want to solve those Wordle puzzles, then you'll need to pay close attention to the colour of the tiles after each guess. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, as well as your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your precious winning streak.
