The innocent victim in Bucha was aspiring makeup influencer Iryna Filkina. Drone camera footage also appears to show the moment the 52-year-old was killed as she pushed her bicycle home. She seemed to have no idea several Russian tanks and other military vehicles were lying in wait. As she rounds a corner in her distinctive blue coat, she was gunned down by one of the tanks. Iryna's daughter, who has fled Ukraine, had pleaded with her mum not to cycle home on the day she died. After the image of the hand in the mud was published, make-up artist Anastasiia Subacheva identified Iryna. "When I saw the picture, I physically felt like my heart started to break," Anastasiia said. Iryna had contacted her in February about classes. She wanted to become a makeup artist and to boost her following on Instagram. The aspiring influencer wanted to look her best for a concert. Iryna was killed by the Russians on March 5 but has only just been identified.
