PlayStation Plus subscribers don't have long to wait until the free PS4 and PS5 games are revealed for May 2022. Sony will reveal the May PS Plus games at 4.30pm BST on April 27. The games will be available to download less than a week later on the morning of May 3. Of course, it looks like the PS4 and PS5 games may have been revealed ahead of schedule, courtesy of a recent leak. If the reports are true, then the May 2022 line-up will be headlined by EA's blockbuster football simulation FIFA 22. One of the best-selling games of the past 12 months, FIFA 22 is a heavyweight freebie, especially compared to some of the recent PS Plus downloads. FIFA 22 will reportedly be joined by Tribes of Midgard, which will be playable on PS4 and PS5. "Tribes of Midgard is a co-op game with a unique blend of action, survival, and roguelite elements," reads the official description. "Players must defend their village from hordes of invaders—deadly spirits and gigantic brutes—that every night threaten to destroy the Seed of Yggdrasil, the sacred tree you’re sworn to protect. Only by protecting the Seed, you and your tribe can stop Ragnarök—the end of the world!" The PlayStation 4 version of Curse of the Dead Gods completes what is a strong line-up for May 2022.  As a reminder, the May 2022 freebies will replace the current line-up of Hood: Outlaws and Legends, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated and Slay the Spire. If you haven't already, make sure you download the April free games before the deadline of May 3.
