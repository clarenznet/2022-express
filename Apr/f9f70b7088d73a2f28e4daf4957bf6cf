The 63-year-old, who looked a mere fraction of her age in the snaps, donned a pair of bunny ears to match those worn by her brood. The Frozen hitmaker seemed to have scarcely aged a day since her career began, with some commenting that Madonna looked more like her kids' big sister rather than their mum, due to her smooth visage. She was with David Banda, 16, Mercy, 15, and her two twin girls Estere and Stella, who, at nine-years-old, are the babies of the family. However her two older biological children - 25-year-old Lourdes Leon and 21-year-old Rocco Ritchie, from her previous relationship with Guy Ritchie, were nowhere to be seen. David, her eldest adoptive son, appeared to imitate his mother's pout as the pair posed for the camera in one fun-loving snap. She affectionately described her family as "crazy bunnies", as they got to work decorating Easter eggs and indulging in seasonal crafts.
