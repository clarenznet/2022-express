Fortnite developer Epic Games has released a brand new update for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and Nintendo Switch. The new Fortnite download is a content update, and not a major one. This means there's no annoying server downtime to deal with, so you can download the patch, and start playing as soon as it's installed. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a brief preview about what to expect. "We've just released a maintenance patch on all platforms to address stability and Outfits physics issues," reads an Epic tweet. "You will be able to download the patch before launching your game." According to a previous Epic tweet, certain outfits weren't functioning properly after last week's update. "We're investigating an issue with some physics no longer functioning properly on several Outfits as of v20.20," Epic previously tweeted. "We'll provide an update when we have more info." According to Epic, the fan-favourite LMG weapon has also been unvaulted as part of content update 20.20.1. Interestingly, Fortnite insiders like HYPEX and Shiina have uncovered plans for Epic to release update 20.30 next week. Fortnite update 20.30 will be a much bigger update, making changes to the map, adding new items and plenty of challenges. In the meantime, fans can purchase new Street Fighter skins and items from April 28. "Taking a break from the crane game, World Warriors Blanka and Sakura are soon reaching for victory on the Fortnite Island! "To celebrate 35 years of Street Fighter, youâ€™ll be able to grab their Outfits and accessories in the Item Shop later this week (starting Thursday, April 28, at 8 PM ET).
