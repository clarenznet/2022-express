Erik ten Hag will remain in his comfort zone if he rejects Manchester United for RB Leipzig, according to Dutch football expert Marcel van der Kraan. The journalist claims Ten Hag will have a much easier time at Leipzig than at United, where he would have a "major" job on his hands. The Ajax boss reportedly has offers from both clubs to take over as manager from next season. The Red Devils decided last week that the Dutchman is their preferred candidate to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick. However, Ten Hag is yet to decide if Old Trafford is the right place for him. Van der Kraan claims the 52-year-old is far more familiar with German football, having spent a couple of years at Bayern Munich's reserve team, and the language. Ten Hag will not accept United's offer unless his demands are met. Van der Kraan says he is more likely to get what he wants at Leipzig due to the structure in place at the Bundesliga club.

It's a comfort zone for him. "England on the contrary is not a comfort zone at all. He's not as fluent in English as he is in German, which is almost his second language, and the job he has at Manchester United is so much bigger than at Leipzig. "At Leipzig there's a clear structure, the hierarchy is clear, the setup around the team is clear and the ambitions of the club are clear. At Manchester United he has a massive job, he knows that, he's been informed, he gets told by the media, he gets told by his agents, by the people around him.
