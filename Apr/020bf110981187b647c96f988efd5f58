Beverly Knight looked incredible as she arrived at this year’s Olivier Awards, which were held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Sunday. The singer and actress was nominated for best actress for her role in the musical The Drifters Girl. The 49-year-old wore a sparkling white dress on the red carpet with a thigh-high split. The one-shouldered number also had a halterneck detail, which stunned fans. The dress also had a sheer mesh skirt which the star accessorised with black heels. On Sunday, Beverley took to social media and tweeted: “IT’s TODAY my loves! “The @OlivierAwards are here! “Currently in our dressing rooms waiting to do our dress rehearsal. “Very exciting!”
