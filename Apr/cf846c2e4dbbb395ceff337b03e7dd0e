Rose Ayling-Ellis looked phenomenal as she showed off her toned abs on the red carpet at the 2022 BAFTA Craft party. The glamorous event took place at the lavish Sea Containers hotel in London and featured a star-studded guest list. The Strictly Come Dancing star opted for a skintight green dress that flashed her toned midriff. She paired the gown with some white heeled sandals and gold jewellery, including a set of two chain necklaces. The 27-year-old actress chose to pair her orange and yellow eyeshadow with a berry lip and a subtle rosy blush. She wore her long chestnut tresses down in a side parting and could be seen running her fingers through her hair as she posed for the cameras. Rose, who is best-known for playing Frankie Lewis in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, became the first deaf contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2021.
