Coronavirus cases have remained high across the UK in recent weeks, but almost all restrictions across the four nations are no longer in place. But despite ploughing on with ending all restrictions in England, the Prime Minister has refused to rule out another “non-pharmaceutical” intervention should a new variant spring up. Mr Johnson told GB News: "I want to avoid any such thing ever happening again. "And I can't rule out something... I can't say that we wouldn't be forced to do a non-pharmaceutical intervention again of the kind that we did. "I think it would be irresponsible of any leader, in any democracy to say that they're going to rule out something that could save life. He continued: ”I’ve got to be absolutely frank with you, there could be a new variant, more deadly, there could be a variant that affects children badly that we really need to contain” But after the Prime Minister was allegedly breaking his own laws and is now the subject of an investigation by the Metropolitan Police, would you follow the rules if he imposed another lockdown?
