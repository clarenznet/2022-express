The group started its programme with a multimillion-pound investment to upgrade 60 hotels this year. Chief executive Craig Bonnar said: "Travelodge has been a trailblazer since it opened the UK's first budget hotel in 1985. "We are once again evolving by launching a new budget luxe hotel design while maintaining our great value. "This is our most radical transformation to date and has been created in response to ever-increasing expectations from customers."
