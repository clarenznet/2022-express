Paris Hilton, 41, put on a breathtaking display at the Grammys 2022 last night. The heiress stepped out on the red carpet in a jewel-encrusted sheer cape by Atelier Zuhra. The cape was adorned with silver jewels, over an almost transparent gown. The model’s hair was styled up into a Barbie-style ponytail, finishing the look. Paris could also be seen posing alongside husband Carter Reum, as the two shared some affectionate moments. The star has previously spoken to Delish, in August 2021, about the split in her private and public personas. Paris explained that she developed the “dumb rich blonde” persona as a result of traumatic experiences during her time at boarding schools. “(They were) almost a protective shell, or a mask, to live in this fantasy world and portray this perfect life,” Paris said. The star added that it was a “coping mechanism". On her husband Carter, she said he was unlike any of her ex-boyfriends, as he lifts her up and “makes (me) feel safe.”
