Premium Bonds are a savings account managed by National Savings and Investment (NS&I), which is backed by the UK Government. At the start of each month, two lucky Britons will be made millionaires alongside a whole host of other winners. Any deposits made with Premium Bonds are 100 percent protected from any potential harm or fraud which explains its long-term success with savers. However, the savings provider does explain why newer Bonds seem to be more likely to be picked. On the NS&I website, it said: “Over 95 percent of eligible Premium Bonds have been bought since the year 2000.” READ MORE: 'Biggest u-turn ever' Dragons' Den duo shocked to get offers after being called 'horrible' Britons win prizes between £25 and the £1million jackpot each month. In April, there were 210 prize winners who won prizes between £1million and £5,000. Some six people from different parts of the UK are £100,000 richer while 11 people are £50,000 better off.

Some of the unclaimed prizes date back to when the scheme first started in 1957. There is still £74million of prizes sitting unclaimed so Britons are urged to check. Thousands of savers could already be sitting on a cash prize.
