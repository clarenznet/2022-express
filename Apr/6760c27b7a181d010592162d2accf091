In the four-page letter - dated September 24, 1815 - the composer tells librettist Georg Friedrich Treitschke to secure 200 gold ducats and an evening's receipts for their planned opera Romulus und Remus. He tells his friend to negotiate so he isn't taken for a "loser". Expressing annoyance at the measly initial cash offer, Beethoven writes: "There is nothing I should like better than to be able to write altogether gratis, but in the present state of things such a thing would be difficult for a German, or much more an Austrian artist! "Only London could make one so fat, that one would be able afterwards to resist in Germany, or rather here, the leanest bits." The opera was abandoned. The mint-condition letter is being sold by RR auctions, with bids already topping Â£50,800. It ends on Thursday.
