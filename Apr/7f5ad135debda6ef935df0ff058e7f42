The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine suggested locals in the town of Izium, which is south-east of Kharkiv, took drastic action against occupying forces. The report comes after the discovery of mass graves of civilians on the outskirts of Kyiv following Russia’s retreat. A statement posted on Facebook said: “Ukrainians resist the occupiers by all available means…Local residents…‘treated’ Russians from the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation with poisoned pies. “As a result, two occupiers died at once, another 28 were taken to the intensive care unit. Their current state is being clarified. About 500 more [Russians]… are in hospital due to severe alcohol poisoning of unknown origin.” The post suggested Russia had opted to classify the cases as “so-called ‘non-combat losses’”. Civilians have taken matters into their own hands since Putin ordered his invasion, with one woman apparently downing a drone by throwing a jar of tomatoes at it in Kyiv. Despite Putin’s attempt to portray his invasion as a bid to “de-Nazify” Ukraine, the country remains openly hostile to Russian troops. Nato estimated last week that as many as 15,000 Russian troops have died since the beginning of the war. Izium, close to the Russian border, is likely to be a focal point of fierce fighting in the coming weeks, as Putin sees it as an important base from which to launch assaults in the Donbas region. Controlling it would allow Russia to split the eastern front, dividing up Ukraine’s forces in the north and south.
