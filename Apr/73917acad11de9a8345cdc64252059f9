Jamie Redknapp has named five players who should no longer be at Manchester United next season. United will finish a fifth-successive campaign without a trophy this term and are in a fight to finish in the Premier League top four. There are several big-name players at the club who are out of contract this summer. Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata all find themselves in that position. United are yet to officially announce what will happen to any of the players. But Redknapp believes the time has come for them all to be moved on. He said on Sky Sports: "More importantly is the players who are going to be leaving. Pogba, Lingard, they're going to be going on free transfers in the summer.

I think that will be the best for the club right now because I don't think they're going to take the club forward, I think they need a change themselves. "Next season, [Marcus] Rashford is out of contract, [Luke] Shaw as well. There's not too many players, I know Bruno [Fernandes] has just signed a contract, that you're looking at if you're coming into that club and going 'I can't wait to work with him, I can't wait to get them going'." A fifth player Redknapp believes should leave is Rashford. The 24-year-old was left out of the starting XI for Saturday's draw against Leicester despite no other recognised forward being available to Ralf Rangnick. Redknapp says there will be no shortage of takers for Rashford. The pundit claims he must move on for the sake of his own career.

He looks like he's fallen out of love with the game right now. "Go play somewhere, because there's no doubt there's a player in there. For him, there will be hundreds of clubs that will want him. "He's had enormous success against the likes of Paris Saint-Germain in Europe, clubs in England would want him, Tottenham, Arsenal. Everyone would want him. But I think his time has run now at Manchester United." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport? Join our brand new Facebook group by clicking here
