If you're thinking of getting a 4K TV to upgrade your living room set-up then chances are the choice boils down to either LG or Samsung. These South Korean tech giants have long been the top two TV makers in the world, with Samsung holding the honour of being the biggest TV manufacturer for the past 16 years in a row. But LG is running a deal that may entice you over to their side, with the Seoul-based firm giving customers up to £300 worth of cashback when they purchase a 2022 TV. Cashback is available on select LG TVs released in 2022, including the 55inch OLED55C24LA. If you're lucky enough to have bagged a PS5 or Xbox Series X recently, this 4K Smart TV - which usually costs £1,899.98 - is a great option. That's because the 4K TV comes equipped with features you need to get the most out of your shiny new console - namely four HDMI 2.1 ports as well as support for 120Hz refresh rates.  These features are what you need to get the best possible picture quality from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. At the time of writing this LG TV is out of stock on the company's official website, but you can sign up for stock alerts. Alternate options are the 75inch LG QNED81, which usually is priced at £2,299.98, or the 86inch LG NANO76. Both TVs come with HDMI 2.1 support, however the QNED81 doesn't support 120Hz refresh rates, whereas the LG NANO76 does.  You will be able to get up to £300 cashback if you purchase an eligible LG TV from a participating retailer online or in-store between April 13 and June 1 2022. Then, you will have to head to the LG TV Cashback website and enter details about your purchase before July 31 2022. It will take up to seven days to validate your claim, after which LG will be in touch to give you an update and arrange payment. Besides the official LG online store, retailers participating in the promotion include Argos, John Lewis, Currys, AO.com and Costco.
