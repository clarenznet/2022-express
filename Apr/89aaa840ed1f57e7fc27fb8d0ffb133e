Pro-Brexit businessman and former MEP Ben Habib told Express.co.uk: "Article 16 is not, as it is so often described, a nuclear button. It is a legitimate safeguarding measure within the Northern Ireland Protocol entitling the UK to suspend part or all of the Protocol if it is doing societal, environmental, or economic damage and/ or there is a diversion of trade. The grounds to invoke it exist. This is accepted by the Government. That it does not invoke is an act of gross negligence and constitutional self-harm. The Government and our PM are cowed by the EU’s (illegal) threat of sanctions if Article 16 is invoked. Our government and our PM lack backbone and an understanding of how properly to deal with this situation. It is a tragedy." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
