Calah Rose, 32, from Florida, was left devastated when her 13-year-old rescue dog Bleu was diagnosed with cancer last year. During his final weekend, she treated her beloved pooch to his favourite human foods as she said goodbye. Ms Rose told The Mirror: "We spent the last weekend eating all of his favourite human yummies because I knew that in just two days I'd have to give him back to heaven." The 32-year-old rescued the Labrador cross Great Dane when he was just six weeks old. She said: "I've never been alone because he's always been by my side." Ms Rose said Bleu was a "gentle giant" but "fiercely protective" of her. She said: "When I was expecting my children, he guarded my belly from anyone who thought to get too close. "He hated getting his snout wet. "I even had to get in the bathtub with him just for a wash." Bleu began showing signs that he was unwell in August 2021 and Ms Rose was told last week that he did not have long left to live.
