Welsh beauty Carol Vorderman donned clingy black leggings with a stripe detail on the thigh, paired with a figure-flattering top with sheer mesh sections on the sleeves. 61-year-old Carol, who looked a mere fraction of her real age in the jaw-dropping outfit, told her 217,000 followers that this Easter had been busy for her. It comes after the former Countdown host's horse, Jony Max, had excelled at Plumpton Race Course yesterday, and she posted a selection of pictures to celebrate his showjumping prowess. Though she was excited to celebrate the horse's win, it was Carol who stole the show today, as she showcased her stunning physique. The maths whiz is no stranger to showing off her assets - in fact, as she encouraged fans on her Instagram profile: "Rock with what you've got!"
