During the statement, Mr Sunak said: “Homeowners who have solar panels, heat pumps and insulation installed will no longer pay five percent VAT – they will pay zero.” But other green taxes remain in place, which have been described as a “stealth tax” worth hundreds of pounds a year to British billpayers. Ecotricity boss Dale Vince said earlier this year: "The government talk about high energy prices and bemoan them... but what they don't talk about is the fact they take £9 billion a year from our energy bills in a combination of VAT and about five social and environmental policies." Around 12 percent of the average energy bill set at the Energy Price Cap goes toward funding green energy programmes. The typical price cap is made up of wholesale costs, operating costs, network costs, VAT and the green taxes - but how much goes on each depends on the supplier. The cap increased by £693 in April, causing millions of British households to fall into fuel stress. But as the UK faces one of its worst cost of living crises in years, should the Government scrap the taxes on energy to soften the burden on ballplayers? Or should they use policies like a windfall tax on energy companies? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
