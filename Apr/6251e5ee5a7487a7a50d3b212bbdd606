He said: "slandering decent people in a private room, let the slander spread, without the backbone to repeat it in public."

But Mr Johnson says "it is in an indication of the depths to which he is willing to sink that he accuses me of traducing journalists, what he says is completely without any foundation whatever, I did not attack the BBC last night".
