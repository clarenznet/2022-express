Demi Rose set pulses racing yesterday after posting a series of throwback snaps from her time at California music festival, Coachella. The model, 27, stunned as she bared her behind for the windswept snaps while also risking a wardrobe malfunction by opting for a tiny bikini top which revealed a portion of her breasts in view of her 19 million Instagram followers. Standing in the stunning desert landscape, the Instagram model gazed wistfully into the distance as she donned a pair of dark chocolate coloured leather chaps with a series of buckles going down the length of each leg. The trousers cheekily showcased her peachy rear, on which rested a series of fringing. Demi wore a bejewelled bag slung over one shoulder and displayed the back of a daringly strappy top, which revealed a perfect tan. In the next picture, the Birmingham native threw her long blonde tresses over her shoulder while showcasing under-boob thanks to the tiny bikini top.

She had previously donned a black lace bustier with a tassel, cream jacket and matching midi skirt to watch the music acts.
