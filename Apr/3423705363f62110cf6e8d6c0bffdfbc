Firefighters were on the scene trying to set the flames under control, with eight fire engines. Police were also in attendance. An eyewitness said the building on fire is part of the facilities of a business named Tideford Organic Foods. The blaze sent thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. A woman who works for Tideford Organic Foods claimed that she could tell something was wrong before the explosion because of a worrying smell. She told DevonLive: "I smelt it all night. It smelt like wax burning. I thought it was coming from the fly zapper. "All of a sudden I could really smell it. Luckily one of the lads had just come in and came out of the toilet. "He turned around and said sh** it's on fire. Get out!" Another eyewitness said they heard the explosion before flames ripped through the roof of the warehouse. Police and firefighters reportedly arrived on the scene at around 8.15pm on Monday evening. Eyewitnesses also described how crowds had gathered in the area. However, police were reportedly trying to clear onlookers from the area, amid concerns about the plastic fumes.
