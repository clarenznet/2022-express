Andrea McLean, 52, is the co-founder and CEO of This Girl Is On Fire - an online mindset membership platform helping women to think differently about themselves through online classes, podcasts and masterclasses. The journalist and presenter quit Loose Women in 2020 after 13 years fronting the ITV daytime show. The mum-of-two spoke candidly about her decision to sell her family home in a bid to fund her business. The on-screen star admitted that it was not a "desperate move" but explained that she did require money to invest in better technology for her company but did not want to seek out an investor. The former Loose Women presenter shared that she had no regrets about moving out of her Surrey abode which she shared with her husband Nick Feeney and her two children, son Finlay, 20, and daughter Amy, 15. The entrepreneur explained that they "needed more money" for the app which would help expand her business.

"With This Girl's on Fire we had invested so much time and money into technology and the technology was letting us down," she explained. "We opened the membership for a few hundred women and then we shut the doors so that we could test and measure it on a beta-testing app. It was taking too long to get it to work so that we could launch it. "We thought, 'If this doesn't work soon we're going to need more money.'"  She went on: "People think you need to invest in bricks and mortar. You need to have a home, that's your investment. "I thought, 'No. What if I invest in myself?'" Andrea continued: "I believe in me and I think that I'm a capable woman. "Actually, I'm going to take the money out of the house and use it to invest it in me. Once I changed that mindset it was really liberating. DON'T MISS...

What does it mean?'" She went on: "It doesn't mean anything because we rent a house. "We still put the curtains up and throw a cover on the bed and make it look nice. It's the same thing." Andrea added: "You don't ever really own your own home, you're paying the mortgage off. What's the difference?"
