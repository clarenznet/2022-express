A White Paper on the future of the BBC has earmarked the end of the TV licence fee and to look for “the most fair and appropriate funding mechanism” for the broadcaster. The licence fee has been a controversial subject of late as Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries wages war against the yearly bill. Ms Dorries said the current model is “completely outdated” and that in the coming months ministers would be “looking very seriously about how we fund the BBC”. A BBC spokesperson said: “The White Paper recognises the BBC’s critical role in supporting the UK creative sector and we remain focused on delivering great value for all licence fee payers and representing the UK to audiences around the world.” The licence fee charges homes £159 per year to watch live colour TV - a charge that has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years as the Government looks to hold the BBC to account over alleged impartiality issues. So, do you think the TV licence should be revoked? How do you think the BBC should be funded? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
