Major General Vladimir Frolov was buried with military honours at Serafimovskoe Cemetery in St Petersburg on Saturday.  Alexander Beglov, governor of the city, revealed his death happened during fighting but gave no details. In a gushing eulogy, he claimed Maj Gen Frolov had "died a heroic death in battle" fighting against "a new generation of Nazis". Colonel Ivan Grishin died from shrapnel wounds while commanding the 49th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade near Kharkiv. The father of two was remembered in a propaganda-laden tribute from MP Artem Malashchenkov, who said: "The men will continue your work of the special military operation." News of these deaths emerged as Moscow's youngest fatality, Roman Akimov, 18, was identified from DNA. Putin has lost eight generals and at least 35 colonels, possibly more.
