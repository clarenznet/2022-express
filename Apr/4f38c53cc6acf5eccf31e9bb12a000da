The presenter returned to the TV channel more than a year after he stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain. And he couldn't resist a repeat performance yesterday on daytime host Lorraine Kelly's show. Piers quit ITV after an on-air row with weatherman Alex Beresford over the Prince Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah Winfrey. And it looks like there will be more heated debate on his new show Uncensored, which starts on TalkTV next week. In a promotional video, Piers clashes with former US president Donald Trump, who appears to storm off. Mr Trump has accused the host of "deceptively" editing their chat. Piers told Lorraine: "All I would say is watch the interview." Uncensored is on TalkTV on Monday at 8pm
