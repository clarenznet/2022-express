The backlash came after Ms Sturgeon spoke to the press about the Tory party lockdown rule breaks. The First Minister claims MPs were using the ongoing war in Ukraine to keep Prime Minister Boris Johnson in office, describing it as the "lowest of the low response." Mr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have both been fined after the investigation into allegations of senior Tories breaking their own set lockdown rules at No 10 Downing Street, causing a major scandal with the British public. Ms Sturgeon also made comments that the Tories were riding roughshod over normal democracy. The Scottish First Minister has been criticised for her stance due to some citizens questioning her tough pandemic regulations, and mask wearing mandates.

"Then perhaps the lowest of the low, the use of the horror and suffering of people in Ukraine, as a reason why Boris Johnson should stay in office.

"Really basic things like telling the truth to parliament, and then there also has to be agreed consequences of those standards of behaviour reached, that's always been the case. "And suddenly we don't have that anymore, the Tories are refusing to abide by these long-established accepted norms of democracy, and that's a real situation.
