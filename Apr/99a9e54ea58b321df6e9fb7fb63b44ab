Meghan Markle’s father announced in an interview with GB News’s Dan Wootton on Monday that he will fly to London to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee in June. He hopes the “grand gesture” will allow him to reunite with Meghan, saying that he would like to “repair” the relationship between them. Although he commented: “I'm getting the feeling that if they know I'm coming, they won't be coming. “But if they do come I would love to reach out, speak with them and try to figure out what was wrong and how we can repair it. I don't see that happening. But I certainly would like to try." Mr Markle said he would also like to meet other members of the Royal Family, including his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet for the first time, adding that he is looking forward to “paying his respects” to the Royal Family. Mr Markle said: “I’m going to show my respects for the Queen, and I’m going to let them know and make sure the Queen understands my entire family respects the Queen and the royals. “We admire them, and we want them to know that that’s how we feel about them and that’s how we feel about England.” He said he was reaching out to the Royal Family to make them aware he has “no ill-feeling about the royals whatsoever”. Mr Markle said he would like to meet Prince Charles to thank him “for walking my daughter down the aisle”. Mr Markle has been estranged from his daughter, the Duchess of Sussex, since 2018. He did not attend her wedding to Prince Harry in May 2018 as he was recovering from surgery after a heart attack. Since then, he has publicly criticised Harry and Meghan on several occasions.
