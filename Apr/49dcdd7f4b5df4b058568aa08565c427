Flying the French flag, the huge Navy Mistral-class amphibious assault ship FS Dixmude (L9015) was spotted leaving Portsmouth on Thursday. The Mistral is the French Navy's first all-electric warship and is fitted with two Alstom 7MW electric azimuth pods. Commissioned in 2012, the 16,500-tonne warship is capable of carrying an impressive number of helicopters and amphibious forces and is 653ft in length. Pictures show the mighty ship attracted onlookers in Portsmouth who gathered to take a look at her before she left. But she is not as large as the UK’s pair of huge Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, which each weigh a stonking 65,000 tonnes and are about 920ft long.

Dixmude (L9015) is a type of helicopter carrier of the French Navy. She is the third ship of the Mistral class.  She was delivered to the French defence procurement agency in January 2012, three months ahead of schedule. The Mistral class is a class of five amphibious assault ships built by France and are often referred to as "projection and command ships". It is capable of transporting and deploying 16 NH90 or Tiger helicopters, four landing barges, up to 70 vehicles including 13 Leclerc tanks, or a 40-strong Leclerc tank battalion and 450 soldiers. The ships are equipped with a 69-bed hospital and are capable of serving as part of a NATO Response Force, or with United Nations or European Union peace-keeping forces.
