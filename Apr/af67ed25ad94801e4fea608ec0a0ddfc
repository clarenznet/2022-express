New figures published by the Department for Transport (DfT), sourced from mapping provider Zap Map, show that 7,500 new devices have been installed across the UK over the past 12 months, bringing the total to 30,290. Some 1,235 of those were rapid devices with an output of 25kW and above which allow faster charging than at home. Just in the past three months the number of chargers has increased by seven percent. Recently, the Government announced a plan to increase the number of EV charging stations tenfold by 2030, injecting £450million into its dedicated infrastructure strategy fund. And last month BP said they would be investing £1billion in EV chargers in the UK.

But sales of EVs are so high that by the time the Government’s ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars comes into force there could be as many as 18 million battery-powered cars on the roads. The DfT said the charger increase has been spread across "all regions of the UK" but noted that there remains "an uneven geographical distribution of charging devices within the UK".

That's shown in data that states London has 111 public chargers per 100,000 people, while the whole of Northern Ireland, for example, has just 18, reported Autocar. In terms of rapid chargers, the divide is even more marked - Scotland has 13.6 per 100,000, while Northern Ireland has just 1.3. The North West of England has 5.9 per 100,000, while the North East has 9.4. On average across the UK, there are 45 public chargers per 100,000 people, but last month, there was a 78.7 percent year-on-year increase in EV registrations, meaning electric cars now have a 16.1 percent market share. The number of public chargers has generally increased in line with EV sales. The DfT's figures show that there were only around 2,000 devices in operation at this point in 2015, rising to 10,000 in 2018. But that rate of expansion isn't seen across the country. The number of chargers in London rose by 9.4 percent, while the uptick in Northern Ireland was around 10 times slower. But that trend was reversed for rapid devices specifically: London recorded a 1.9 percent increase in these, while there was a 13.6 percent rise in Northern Ireland. The DfT said that "the number of available devices can fluctuate for a range of reasons", noting that while new installations contribute to an overall increase, the numbers can dip when devices are temporarily or permanently decommissioned - and direct replacements have no effect on numbers.
