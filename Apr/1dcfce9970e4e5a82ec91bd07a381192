The Channel 4 cake connoisseur is now helping to pick the B&Q Gardener of the Year. Restaurateur Dame Prue, 82, a hit among a new generation of budding cooks, joins returning judges and gardening experts Matt Childs, Humaira Ikram and Steve Guy. The winner of the competition receives £10,000 and B&Q’s coveted Golden Trowel while three runners-up get £1,000. There are four new categories for this year – the Classic Gardener, the Year-Round Gardener, the Productive Gardener and the Eccentric Gardener. Dame Prue has already shown her green-fingered skills on her More4 outdoors show Prue’s Great Garden Plot, which launched last October. It revealed how the Great British Bake Off star and husband John Playfair, 74, created a garden on a two-acre site filled with buried bits of farm machinery after building a house on the land she owned in Oxfordshire.
