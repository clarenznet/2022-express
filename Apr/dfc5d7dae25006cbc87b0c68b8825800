The Russian president was speaking at the Vostochny cosmodrome in east Russia after meeting Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. He was there to mark the 60th anniversary of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human to journey into outer space. But Putin could to help but veer off topic, as he appeared to send a veiled threat to NATO. He said: "We are marking the day of space breakthrough. "This recognises our place in the future and our continued developments. "This means we will reach all of our aims, I have no doubt we will do this. "I want to say some warm words to the servicemen and aerospace troops. "We know our officers are taking part in a special military operation in Donbas. They are acting effectively." Mr Putin added that his troops are "using modern weapons with unprecedented characteristics". He noted: "Our achievements are based on developments in the peaceful space industry and the achievements of Russian thinkers. "Our space apparatus landed on the hot surface of Venus – no other country has managed to do that since. "All the achievements are very inspirational and our ancestors inspire us to move forward despite all the difficulties. "We will continue to develop transport planes and we will continue our Moon programme. "We must respond successfully to all the challenges in space." The Russian leader was referring to the Venera programme that was developed by the Soviet Union between 1961 and 1984 to gather information about the planet. 10 probes successfully landed on the surface of the planet, including the two Vega program and Venera-Halley probes, while thirteen probes successfully entered the Venusian atmosphere. But, despite Putin's admiration, the probes all died within two hours of reaching the surface.
