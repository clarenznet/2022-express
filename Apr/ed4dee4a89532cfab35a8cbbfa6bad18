Alan, the owner of the poor Shih Tzu named Molly, was panicked as he witnessed his pet being ravaged by an American Bully XL. Molly’s torture comes to light after two toddlers were killed and another eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after being attacked by dogs in March, in what was called a “dog attack epidemic”. The dog that stormed against Alan’s Shih Tzu was of the same breed as the dog that took the life of Bella-Rae. Alan is now calling for American Bully XLs to be banned through the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 legislation. The shocking assault on Molly happened on February 25, as Alan was walking her in the Manor Farm Park in Birmingham, the Mirror reported. Alan noticed the menacing dog coming at them ready to attack, so he grabbed little Molly and held her on his shoulder. Two people thought to be the dog’s owners were not helpful as they could not control the mad dog, according to Alan. He told the publication: “It started jumping up and was clearly after my dog. "I was screaming at these people to come and get the dog." He added: "I was screaming at the utterly useless owners to get the dog off us but they did not move, they just stood and watched." The enraged, uncontrollable dog grabbed Molly’s lead and pulled her to the ground before attacking more, causing her severe injuries. Alan with another onlooker managed to get the dog off by kicking and punching it, saving her from what would have been a fatal ending. He then rushed Molly to the vets, where she was looked after. Molly’s injuries were so acute that the vet told Alan she was lucky to be alive. Alan told of the savage dog: "It had a head like a t-rex and a body like a Staffy on steroids.
