Despite having announced her departure from A Place in the Sun, it looks like Danni Menzies is having no trouble seeing the sunny side of life in London. The TV host engaged in a spot of impromptu modelling in a barely there Calvin Klein two-piece after what seemed to have been a session in the gym. She gave her 97,100 followers a glimpse of her derriere as she posed with her back to the camera, while clutching a towel. Celebrating friendship with Lou Barton, her pal and fitness instructor in the capital, she captioned her Instagram photo series: "Me time is better with you." She and an equally scantily clad Lou posed in the mirror together while pouting and flashing peace signs. Thousands of followers liked the post and left admiring comments, such as @meds.uk, who exclaimed: "If Carlsberg did bodies!"
