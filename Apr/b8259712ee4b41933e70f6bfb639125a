  Demi, 27, looked stunning in her latest Instagram video reel, which she shared with her 19.3 million followers. The star looked sensational in the clip set to Jnr Choi and Sam Tompkins’ To The Moon, as she could be seen enjoying the extravagant music festival with her friends. Demi’s first outfit featured a light pink bra with a golden clasp at the front, which showed off her eye-popping cleavage, and a pair of pink pants to match. The star completed the outfit with a white, lacey skirt, with a split at the front that allowed her two-piece to still be visible.  Demi wore her hair in long, blonde, beachy waves and opted for soft pink makeup to complete the look. For her second outfit, the influencer wore a bejewelled, multi-coloured top that barely contained her bust, supported by black criss-cross straps at the front. She appeared to be wearing tiny black shorts to complete the look and wore her hair in a ponytail that fell past her waist. For her final outfit, she wore a black leotard with an extremely low neckline and put her hair in a long braid. She paired the leotard with a black and white wrap skirt, which was sheer enough to reveal her thong underneath, and her famous derriere, as she accessorised with a black cowboy hat.
