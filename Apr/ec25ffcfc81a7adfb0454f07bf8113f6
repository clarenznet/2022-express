He is said to be "horrified" by the backlog at the Passport Office - which has left holidaymakers facing massive waits and Â£150 surcharges to make fast-track applications. Mr Johnson vowed to haul in bosses and told TalkTV last night: "I don't want to think whether an institution is in the private or public sector, I just want it to deliver value and a good service. "It can cost hundreds of pounds to get your passport. You deserve to have a cheaper, faster service." The Passport Office has repeatedly breached its new 10-week target for processing applications. There has been an unprecedented surge in demand after the lifting of Covid restrictions because five million people delayed renewing their passports during the pandemic. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: "Normally the Passport Office is very slick. It's really disappointing to hear [about delays]. If it's not resolved, it is going to mean that people can't get away." Meanwhile, the DVLA has been condemned for being slow in issuing driving licences, with ministers partly blaming refusal to return to offices. London ministries are said to be less than half-full despite the efforts of cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been leaving notes on empty desks saying: "I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon." Last week he said: "We know that the DVLA [is] simply not working properly with people working from home." Downing Street said last night that Mr Johnson supported Mr Rees-Mogg's efforts.
