Some people love them, while others find them unnecessary. But why do they feature on so many designs? According to Reddit, there is a practical reason behind the bow – and it's come as a big surprise to shoppers. One user posted: "As for the roots of the tradition? It comes from pre-elastic days, when your underthings were held in place by a bit of ribbon threaded through the eyelet lace at the tops. "The little bow is where you tied that ribbon, and of course it's in the front because that's the easiest place to do something like that." Prior to this explanation, the bows were a mystery to many, Manchester Evening News reports. One person commented: "It helps you to realize what way they go on." Another shared: "I like the bow, it tells me got them on the right way have put them on inside out before now." Others told how they find the ribbons "annoying". One woman posted: "Every time I'm trying to find underwear to wear under something fitted that will show shapes, all I can find is underwear with little bows that I wasn't even aware of that will make an awkward little bump just above my lady parts." Another stated: "I've always found them a little pointless and annoying, rather than cute. Kind of like those packs of panties that come in nude, white, and black when you never want to wear the white ones."
