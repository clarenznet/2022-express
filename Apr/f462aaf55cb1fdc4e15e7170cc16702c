There is an unconfirmed report coming out of Izyum, in the Kharkiv region, about a chemical weapons attack fired from multiple rocket launchers. The information was published on Facebook by Nikita Karakay, a Deputy of the Izyum City Council, who wrote: "Symptoms of poisoning: redness of the eyes, nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, loss of consciousness. Blood samples were taken from the victims, clothes were sent for examination." This comes as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed the Kremlin was starting a new stage of its so-called special military operation in Ukraine. He said: "Another stage of this operation is beginning and I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation." President Vladimir Putin calls the war in Ukraine "a special military operation" to eliminate what he claims to be a serious threat, saying his aim was to demilitarise Russia's southern neighbour. Since the start of this "operation", thousands have died. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
