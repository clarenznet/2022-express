   Rory looked ready to compete in the tournament wearing a tight, dark blue Nike shirt and matching white cap. He paired the look with white trousers, a chunky white belt and a pair of white trainers with a turquoise tick. Erica looked chic in a white boiler suit which she accessorised with a green cap. The stylish mum wore her hair in a straight, sleek down style and finished off the look with some bangles and delicate earrings.  Daughter Poppy could be seen toddling along in some pictures, while her dad picked her up for others. Poppy wore a little white boiler suit, just like her mum and a white clip in her curly hair. She also had her dadâ€™s name in green written on the back of her outfit. Rory and Erica welcomed Poppy on August 31 2020.
