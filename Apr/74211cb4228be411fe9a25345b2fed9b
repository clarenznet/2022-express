When people think of the 16-bit console wars, they generally picture playground bust-ups between Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo fanboys. There were, however, a large portion of gamers who shunned home consoles in favour of the excellent Amiga 500. If you fall into this category, or perhaps you want to see what you missed, then you'll be happy to hear that the classic Commodore PC is the latest machine to get a miniature makeover. The Amiga A500 Mini is a pint-sized replica of the original Amiga 500. It comes pre-loaded with 25 classic games, including Simon the Sorcerer, Speedball 2, Another World and Worms. Like similar miniature consoles, the A500 contains one or two mod-cons, such as save slots for quickly resuming your games, as well as the ability to load up additional games via a USB stick. Despite its appearance, the A500 Mini doesn't actually contain a working keyboard, instead utilising a controller and onscreen keys. If you want to pick up an Amiga A500 Mini, the recommended retail price is £119.99. Amazon however, is selling the machine for £114.99. You can see the full games list below...
