Forecasters predicted last night could be the coldest April in more than 70 years as the mercury plummeted to -3C (26.6F). Other areas saw sleet and hail too.  The lowest temperature on record for April is -3.1C at Heathrow going back to 1949. And the temperature was expected to be around the same mark at the airport overnight and remain low tonight. But the daytime will bring a slight warming and will reach 9C today and 11C tomorrow. Snow fell upon the memorial to Princess Pocahontas in the grounds of St George's Church in Gravesend in Kent.  And London got its fair share too while places such as Rothwell in Northamptonshire could be forgiven for thinking it was still winter. Met Office meteorologist Matty Box said there is a "cold air mass" over Britain, adding: "There is an ice warning out at the moment. If there's any melting and refreezing overnight then there's an ice risk. "But there should be a fair amount of sunshine as well."
