  Rose Ayling-Ellis appeared beside her Strictly Come Dancing partner Giovanni Pernice on her Instagram story yesterday. The pair put on an adorable display as Rose admitted she couldn’t believe she was “falling for his old tricks” again.      Rose re-posted a couple of clips originally shared by Giovanni on his Instagram, where he showed his 802,000 followers that the dancing duo had been reunited. EastEnders star Rose could be seen smiling away next to the dancer before she realised she was being pranked. Posing for what she thought was a selfie, her smile was quickly replaced by an annoyed frown as she realised he was actually filming a video. “Are you filming?” she asked, before pressing her face up close to the camera and attempting to take the phone out of Giovanni’s hand.

Addressing her 547,000 followers, Rose captioned the next clip: “Why did I fall for this old trick again?” Once again, Rose could be seen beaming for the camera beside a former dance partner before realising he was taking another video. The pair turned their heads to look at each other at the same time as she asked incredulously once more: “Are you filming?!”      At this point, she attempted to grab the Strictly star’s nose as he attempted to shake her off. The clip ended with Giovanni grinning sheepishly while Rose did a little victory dance in the background. The pair’s reunion comes just months after they lifted the glitterball trophy after winning the 19th series of Strictly Come Dancing. Rose has been enjoying a busy time in her career, as she returned to film EastEnders soon after the show ended. READ MORE...

Last night, Giovanni and Rose were reunited once more when they attended a BBC event together. Both Rose and Giovanni have been announced as one of six nominees for Virgin Media's Must-See Moment Award for their iconic silent dance to Zara Larsson's song Symphony as a tribute to the deaf community. Rose, who is deaf herself, moved viewers to tears with her incredible performance, and ended up going on to be the first deaf contestant to win the competition.      Last month the pair attended the Royal Television Society Programme Awards – and were joined by fellow cast members. Although neither Giovanni nor Rose were up for any solo awards, it was a momentous occasion for the cast as they were honoured with the prestigious RTS Judges' Award. Sharing some behind-the-scenes images with Giovanni, Rose gushed: “Congratulations to @bbcstrictly for winning the @royaltelevisionsociety judge award. Strictly magic would not have happened without the teams.” Strictly Come Dancing bosses have confirmed that Giovanni will return to the show this year, joining the likes of Amy Dowden, Kauren Hauer, Dianne Buswell and Johannes Radebe in the line-up.
