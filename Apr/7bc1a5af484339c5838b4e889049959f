LeAnn Rimes, 39, was a vision in a glamorous white gown with cut-out panels that showed off her cleavage. The How Do I Live singer, who is married to Eddie Cibrian,Â attended the star-studded event on Monday. The 39-year-old singer-songwriter, who announced she will be releasing a new album earlier this week, wore a sheer, white gown to the CMT Music Awards. The one-shouldered gown was embellished with pearls which perfectly matched the bejewelled clutch bag she was carrying as she walked the red carpet. LeAnn wore her hair in a loose yet simple style, with her hair pinned back in a face-framing look.
