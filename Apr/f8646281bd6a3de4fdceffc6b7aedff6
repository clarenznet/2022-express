Food recalls are issued when a product could cause damage to an individual due to a health and safety issue. When this happens, companies withdraw the product from shelves and usually ask customers who have already bought it to return it to stores. A number of major supermarkets have recalled foods in recent days and weeks. Asda has recalled a baby food product as it may contain salmonella. The food product was manufactured by Abbott and is used for special medical products for children. Salmonella symptoms include stomach pains, diarrhoea, and vomiting.
