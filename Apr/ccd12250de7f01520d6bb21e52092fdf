Warm weather is set to continue throughout the week, with dry conditions expected for most of the country ahead of the bank holiday. Annie Shuttleworth, Met Office meteorologist, said eastern parts of the country will make the best destination for sun-seekers. She said: “If people are travelling for sunshine, then further eastern areas are more likely to see that brighter weather.  “I think in the main for the bank holiday weekend, we’ll see temperatures quite widely above average across the UK and hopefully they could be very warm in the South East in particular. “Warmer than average certainly, but nowhere near heatwave criteria. “It will definitely be warmer than the week we’ve just had and last week.” The warmest temperature of the year so far has been 69.44F (20.8C), meaning the highs predicted for the South East on the weekend would set a new record for 2022. The warmer air being drawn up from France will be a contrast to the Arctic air mass conditions seen over much of the country in the last week. Temperatures on Tuesday will reach 61F (16C) in the north and around 55F (13C) in the south of England. Dan Rudman, Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, said: “It’s bit of a mixed picture as far as weather is concerned over the long Easter weekend, although feeling warm in places, at least early in the weekend. “Temperature are likely to be above average for the time of year, although low cloud might keep temperatures lower in coastal areas.”
