He beat the 2013 record set by the late Tom Lackey, who was 93. But widower Ivor is not new to adventures in the sky – he’s already enjoyed gliding, ballooning and micro-lighting. He was bitten by the flying bug aged six in 1932 when his parents took him to Sir Alan Cobham’s Flying Circus, which gave many people their first taste of air travel. Dad-of-four Ivor, of Cheltenham, Glous, said: “They paid ten shillings for all of us to go up in an open cockpit aircraft. I couldn’t see over the cockpit but I loved it.” His wing-walk on Saturday from Gloucestershire Airport at Staverton took him full circle. He joined the ground crew there aged 14 during the war, saying: “It was the best job in the world.” Ivor’s wing-walk raised £1,100 for balance charity Ataxia UK. You can donate at JustGiving.
