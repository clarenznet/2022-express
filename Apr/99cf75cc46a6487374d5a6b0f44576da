  Piers Morgan has asked his 7.9 million Twitter followers whether he should “storm in” to Good Morning Britain following his infamous exit last year. The journalist is finally returning to ITV today to appear on Lorraine, which airs straight after GMB.            “Shall I storm into ⁦@GMB?” he tweeted half an hour before his appearance on the show, while watching Kate Garraway and Lorraine Kelly poke fun at him on-air from backstage. It comes when, shortly before his momentous return, his ex ITV colleagues Kate and Lorraine joked that they would have to “locked the doors” beforehand. “Piers Morgan is in the building and hopefully he will stay for the whole interview!” Lorraine announced. “I’ll cross my fingers,” she added, as the Good Morning Britain presenters burst out laughing.     “We’re going to have to go and find him aren’t we?” Kate quipped. Her co-star Richard Bacon said: “He absolutely might come into this studio. “I don’t know if we’ve got a bolt…” “A bolt for the door!” Kate added gleefully, as Lorraine chimed in, “Lock the doors!”      Piers is on Lorraine this morning at 9am on ITV. Alex Beresford’s accusations caused Piers to storm off the set of the ITV show last March, and he has not returned to the channel since. Piers had previously told Express.co.uk he would not speak to Alex again as he reflected on his departure from the programme. Piers, 57, is returning just over one year after he walked off the set of Good Morning Britain following a nasty spat with weatherman Alex Beresford. READ MORE...

He also added fuel to the fire yesterday ahead of this morning’s appearance by making a reference to his run-in with Alex last March. “Anyone know who’s doing the weather on ITV tomorrow morning?” he tweeted.
