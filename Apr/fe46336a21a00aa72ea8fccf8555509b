Carlos Alcaraz has been lauded as the next Rafael Nadal amid his recent success, which has included a Miami Open title win. But former German star Boris Becker has warned the Spaniard not to get ahead of himself as his career starts to take off, telling him to take a break from three future tournaments including Barcelona and Madrid if he is to avoid burning out.  Alcaraz won the Miami Open final in straight sets against Norwegian Casper Ruud on April 3 to earn himself his first ever title at the age of just 18. Having performed well at the US Open, he got to the quarter-final before retiring against Felix Auger-Aliassime. The prodigy has a huge career ahead of him, and is tipped to win multiple accolades in the future. But as with Emma Raducanu, success is not guaranteed after a strong start to a young career. And Becker has told the Spaniard to stay grounded if he is to be successful in the sport. "He must not believe his own hype now," the six-time Grand Slam winner told Eurosport.  "He's not the best yet. He is the high-flyer of the scene. The way he played this year, there was only one player who was better and he is also from Spain. But the clay court season is exhausting, the matches are longer. "I hope he doesn't play Monte Carlo, Barcelona, Madrid and also Rome, because then it's too much for my taste. He has to take a break because he's only human and he's also tired sometimes. When you continue to play tired, the first injuries occur. "It is very important to find the fine line between what is good in tournaments and matches and what is too much?" Becker won his first Grand Slam at 18 years old, picking up six before he turned 23.  However, only three followed after that, with his last Grand Slam coming at just 28 years old. Alcaraz's next Grand Slam comes next month, with the French Open starting in May.
