In recent years, a number of councils across the UK have opted to put in place banning orders against residents walking their dogs along local beaches. Owners who disobey the instruction can be left footing the bill for a £1,000 fine in some regions with authorities imposing the rules from the middle of spring up to the end of summer. The following beaches will be imposing full bans against dog walking from Sunday, May 1 until Friday, September 30: Alum ChineDurley ChineWest CliffEast CliffWest of Fisherman's Walk beachEast of Southbourne to just before Hengistbury HeadAvon BeachFriars Cliff BeachHighcliffe Beach between groynes H8 and H8Shore RoadFlaghead ChineCanford CliffsBranksome ChineWest of Fisherman's Walk beachEast of Southbourne to just before Hengistbury HeadSeatown BeachWest Bay BeachCharmouth BeachLyme Regis front beachSwanage Beach  READ MORE: RAF emergency: Chinook helicopter sends 7700 ‘squawk code’ over Exeter Exmouth beachSidmouth Town Beach - ban from the main town beachSidmouth Jacobs Ladder beach - ban from the immediate area of Jacob's ladderSeaton Beach - ban from the middle sectionBeer Beach - ban from the western halfBudleigh Salterton Beach - ban from the centre portion of the beachBreakwater BeachBroadsands BeachCorbyn HeadGoodrington Sands - South Sands: between the cliffs at the southern end and the signs at Middlestone to the NorthHollicombe BeachMeadfoot Beach- South western part between notices displayed on the foreshoreOddicombe BeachPaignton SandsPreston SandsShoalstone PoolTorre Abbey Sands  Redcar beach - ban from the western corner of the Regent Cinema, down to the Esplanade and Graffenberg StreetSaltburn - ban between Hazelgrove and Saltburn PierScarborough North and South BayWhitby West CliffFileySandsendHartlepool Headland (Block Sands and Fish Sands)Seaton Carew - ban from the Norton Hotel to the Coach ParkRoker beach - ban between Pier Cottages and the junction of Roker ParkSeaburn beach - ban between Queen's Parade and MorrisonsSandhaven - ban between Trow Rocks and the Ocean Beach car parkKing Edward's Bay in TynemouthTynemouth Longsands SouthWhitley Bay SouthCullercoats Bay - ban between North and South PierNewbiggin - ban from the promenade to Beach Terrace and marine centreBlyth beach -ban from Beach Gardens to Blyth LinksBridlington north beach - ban between the northern end of North Marine Promenade and the north-eastern face of the North PierBridlington south beach - ban between the southern face of the South Pier and the eastern face of Princess Mary Promenade Sea WallHornsea - ban between the concrete ramp at Headland View and the steps south of Sands LaneWithernsea - ban between the access ramp opposite Seaside Road and the beach access steps 100 metres south of Pier Towers  DON'T MISS: Kate Middleton is 'special' while Sophie Wessex is more 'accessible' [INSIGHT] Fury over 'dreadful' price difference for items with Tesco Clubcard [NEWS]Sturgeon's minister ridiculed over £31M census botch-up [ANALYSIS] BeaumarisBenllechCemaes BayLlanddwyn, NewboroughLlanddonaTrearddur BayPorth DafarchRest Bay (Rest Point until Golf Bay)Town BeachConey BeachTrecco BayRhos on Sea Beach (between Rhos Point and the eastern end of the Cayley Promenade)Colwyn Bay Beach (between the Victoria Pier and the entrance to Eirias Park).Pensarn Beach (between the embedded wooden posts by the café and the embedded concrete posts at the western end of the promenade).Kinmel Bay Beach (between Dinas Avenue, Kinmel Bay and Sandbank Road Towyn)Llandudno North Shore Beach (from Llandudno Pier to Clarence Road)Llandudno West Shore Beach (between the two stone groynes)Penmaenmawr Beach (from the east side of the café to the sailing club slipway)Llanfairfechan Beach (between the 2 slipways extending down from the promenade to the Low Water Mark)MwntPenbrynAberavonTenby north beachWhitesands, St David'sSwansea Bay: from the River Tawe to the slip opposite Victoria Park and from the beach access at Sketty Lane to the northern edge of the slip at the West Cross InnBracelet BayLimeslade BayRotherslade BayLangland BayCaswell BayPort Eynon beach: from the eastern edge of the steps to Port Eynon beach to the eastern edge of Horton beach accessWhitmore Bay (Barry Island)Cold KnapPenarth seafrontDunraven Bay (Southerndown)Cwm Colhuw (Llantwit)  In Cornwall, the following beaches have a ban on dogs between 10am and 6pm from July 1 to August 31: Cadgwith CoveCastle BeachCawsand BeachChapel Porth BeachChurch CoveHarveys Towans (Godrevy Point, Hayle)Housel BayKennack Sands BeachKynance CoveMaenporth BeachMousehole Beach to Skilly BeachWherry Town to Battery RocksLongrock level crossing to MarazionPerranuthnoePoldu BeachPolurrian Cove BeachPorthcurnoPorthgwarra BeachPorthgwidden BeachPorthleven WestPorthpean BeachPortmellon CovePorthreath Beach including HarbourPraa Sands BeachReadymoney CoveSt George's WellSt Ives Harbour BeachSummer's BeachSwanpool BeachTattam's BeachTunnel Beach While some also have closures from May 15 to September 30.

Look out for signs along beachfronts indicating bans on dogs or restrictions on areas dogs can be walked. All councils ask that you pick up after your four-legged friend and remove any litter while on the beach.
