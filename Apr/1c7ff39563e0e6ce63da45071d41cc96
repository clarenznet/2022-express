Amanda Holden, 51, wowed as she stripped down to her underwear in a sultry 1995 photoshoot. The actress and media personality posed up a storm in a series of unearthed photos that show her most seductive side. She could be seen wearing only a black vinyl bra and lace knickers with a matching garter. For some of the shots, Amanda also threw on a black leather coat, while in other pictures, she could be seen wearing a sheer knitted jumper. In one of the black and white pictures the Britain's Got Talent star used a cigarette as a prop. The alluring photoshoot saw the TV star sport a classic 90s makeup look featuring a bold smokey eye. Amandaâ€™s hair back then was considerably shorter than now, with the star opting for a voluminous bob haircut.
