Official figures show that gross domestic product (GDP) - a measure of the size and health of a country's economy - inched up by 0.1 per cent in February. That marks a slowdown from the month before, when the economy surged by 0.8 per cent. It follows a sharp fall in the production of cars and computer goods as business confidence took a knock, with the cost-of-living crisis and high energy bills unsettling bosses.  The fall in manufacturing was offset by growth in services, in areas such as tourism and travel. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the UK economy is 1.5 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion." Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "The significant slowdown in growth indicates that the UK economy was losing steam even before the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine." He added: "February's slowdown is likely to be the start of a prolonged period of considerably weaker growth as rising inflation, surging energy bills and higher taxes increasingly damage key drivers of UK output." The Government's Office for Budget Responsibility has cut its forecast for growth in 2022 to 3.8 per cent, down from the six per cent set in October. Separately, the ONS released a new set of figures caused by a change in how exports to the EU are measured. While the new measure shows a 25.4 per cent rise in February compared to January, this was a 0.3 per cent dip compared to last December under the old system.
