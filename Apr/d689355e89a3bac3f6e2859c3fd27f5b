Rank outsider Noble Yeats won the Grand National at Aintree with a sensational run on Saturday. Ridden by Sam Waley-Cohen in his last ever race, Noble Yeats came out on top over Any Second Now in a superb fight on Merseyside. A crowd of 70,000 was present to roar the contenders on, and it provided a sensational atmosphere, with this being the first Grand National to take place with fans present since 2019 due to Covid. Speaking after the race, amateur Waley-Cohen said: "I cant say anything. It is a dream. I can't believe it." Winning trainer Emmet Mullins added: "There was a long term plan and it seems to have come off. "A month ago we were probably more confident but the more it went on, other peoples chances were being talked up and we went a bit cold. "But we knew the form was there."
