The clip, shared online, shows staff barricade themselves in the fast food joint in Solihull, West Midlands, after the teenagers had come in for a bite to eat. The youngsters managed to get back inside and it is believed caused damage to the restaurant. Police were called on April 12 but no arrests were made. It is said the commotion started after one of the youths allegedly paid just 77p for two Filet-O-Fish meals and a milkshake. Staff challenged him and it is alleged the manager accused him of fraud. One of the teens told Birmingham Live: "We were pushed out with physical force. "A manager saw that we had got the food for 77p and he said we were committing fraud. "They pushed us out and locked the door on us. One staff member also took my friend's phone off him. That's when we went around to the back and everything escalated." McDonald's saidÂ safety of staff and customers is the "absolute priority". A spokesman said: "On the evening of April 12, our restaurant team acted quickly to stop a group of youths from accessing the store via the rear entrance. "This after they had been asked to leave the premises for causing disruption and damage to the restaurant. We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to crime and anti-social behaviour and will assist police with their investigation." A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: "We were called to a customer dispute. We attended and spoke to everyone. No one reported any injuries or crimes."
