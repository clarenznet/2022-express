The Duke of Sussex spoke openly about his son Archie's plans for the future at his opening speech at the Invictus Games. He revealed that his son wants to follow in his father's footsteps. During his military service in Afghanistan, Prince Harry served as an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner.  He took on this role between 2012 and 2013. Prince Harry told the assembled crowd at the Invictus Games: "To be role models, or the role models, that each of you are takes strength and it takes courage. "When I talk to my son Archie about what he wants to be when he grows up, some days it's an astronaut, other days it's a pilot - a helicopter pilot obviously." During the opening speech, he said that he liked to remind his son "that no matter what you want to be when you grow up, it's your character that matters most".
