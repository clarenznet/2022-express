A study suggests dramatic swings in calorie consumption, often recommended for weight loss, have damaging effects on cardiovascular health and metabolism. The findings also offer potential insights into the long-term impacts of involuntary reductions in food intake caused by poverty.  Researchers divided rats into two groups and gave one a limited diet for a period, before returning them to their normal feed. Dr Aline de Souza, of Georgetown University, US, said: "Rats who went through several cycles of weight loss and body weight recovery had reduced heart and kidney function as well as more insulin resistance, which can be a cause for diabetes." Scientists say restricted calorie intake may permanently alter how blood pressure and insulin are regulated in the body. The team will present their findings at the annual meeting of the American Physiological Society.
