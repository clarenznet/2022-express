In the first round yesterday, the president secured 28.1 percent of the vote and Le Pen 23.3 percent. Afterwards he said "nothing is decided" and pledged to convince all parties to vote for him on April 24. In 2017 he won 66 percent of the vote and Ms Le Pen 33 percent.  She has rebranded her party National Rally to tone down claims of xenophobia and euroscepticism. But Stephen Crabb, chair of Westminster's all-party group on France, said Macron needed to "win well" for the "good of France, for Franco- British relations" and for the "European effort against Russia".
