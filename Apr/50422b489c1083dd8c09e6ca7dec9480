The caption read: "Hey, join me, @tomreadwilson & @mattgoss tomorrow at 8.30 a.m on @itv for the 1st ever #garrawaysgoodstuff . "Life’s so hectic, isn’t it & I find early on Saturday morning is often the only hour I get to myself before the kids & Derek wake up. "So I indulge in me-time - the things I love that make me feel good & stay positive. So the idea behind the show is to share the “good stuff” & hear from great guests about what brings them joy & a sense of well being. "Hope it kickstarts your weekend well & gives you a better week ahead! Oh & do let me know if there’s anything you would love me to explore." Kate's show comes after her husband Derek Draper was diagnosed with Covid in March 2020 and remained in critical condition a year later. He recently made his way home but is still seriously ill and needs round the clock care, with support from Kate and their two children. The family filmed Derek's struggle with the virus during the ITV documentary, Caring for Derek, which highlighted Derek's journey after leaving the hospital as Kate navigates through the difficult circumstances while juggling her ITV job and raising their two children. Garraway's Good Stuff airs Saturday from 8:30am on ITV.
