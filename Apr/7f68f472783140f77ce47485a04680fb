Stacey Slater (played by Lacey Turner) has become increasingly concerned about her grandmother Jean Slater (Gillian Taylforth) in EastEnders and her fears have rubbed off on her eldest daughter Lily Slater (Lilia Turner). However, will the schoolgirl find out some upsetting news about her own health which causes her to run away from home on the BBC soap? In Monday’s EastEnders, Lily admitted to her mum that she was worried about Jean’s erratic behaviour. The youngster was initially thrilled when her nan asked her to be a bridesmaid for her upcoming nuptials to Harvey Monroe (Ross Boatman). However, when Lily realised how much the dress Jean had ordered for her would cost, her face fell. Jean brushed away Lily’s protestations before the schoolgirl explained what had happened to her mum. The stalwart tried her best to address her daughter’s concerns but Lily remained worried.
