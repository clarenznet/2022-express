British Airways said that all the flight cancellations were pre-planned and passengers were given notice of a week or two. Some departures were cancelled earlier than that.

Many employees have been off with Covid in recent months which has exacerbated existing staff shortages. It can be a long process to hire security staff due to the extensive level of clearance required for positions. Tourists are advised to get to the airport well ahead of time to make sure they are able to board their flight. All customers with a cancelled flight are entitled to another flight and could also be entitled to compensation. Passengers are due compensation if the cancellation was announced less than two weeks in advance and the airline was responsible. Which? Travel has called for the Civil Aviation Authority to investigate British Airways over recent cancellations. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: “Our investigation found British Airways neglected to tell passengers about their right to compensation and left families significantly out of pocket by failing to reroute them. “We have written to the Civil Aviation Authority with our findings urging them to investigate this potential rule-breaking. “We encourage BA to always inform passengers of their consumer rights in the event of delays or cancellations, as set out in the law.”
