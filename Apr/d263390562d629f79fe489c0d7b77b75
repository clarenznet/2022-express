Mr Macron may have seen off far-right rival Marine Le Pen, but his second term could be even rockier than his first amid mounting opposition and simmering social discontent. Projections show that the French President secured 57.6 percent of the vote compared with Ms Le Pen's 42.4 percent. Clement Beaune, one of Mr Macron's closest aides and European affairs minister, said on France 2: ""With the far-right at 40%, it shows we've got more work to do." The next hurdle is only weeks away with Parliamentary elections due in June which will determine how easily he can get through his plans for welfare and pro-business reforms. Ms Le Pen has promised a strong opposition bloc in parliament. Mr Macron intimated in his victory speech in Paris that "many compatriots" only voted for him in order to block the extreme right. Christopher Dembik, an economist at Saxo Bank, warned: "[Mr Macron] risks being a lame duck faced with major social discontent if he wants to implement sensitive reforms such as for pensions." Mr Macron wants to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. Philippe Martinez, head of the CGT union, already warned Mr Macron there would be "no honeymoon" for him and he could expect demonstrations unless he backed down.
