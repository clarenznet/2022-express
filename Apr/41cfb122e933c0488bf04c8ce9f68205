Simply head to the bottom of the page for the latest Wordle hints for April 10. And good luck, because Wordle 295 is a tough one! First up let's go over the rules.  In Wordle, players are given six chances to guess a different five-letter word each day. You'll need to use the process of elimination to uncover the correct answer. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the letter tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. If you fail to solve the puzzle, then you'll have to wait until the next day for a new Wordle to be released. You'll also lose your winning streak.
