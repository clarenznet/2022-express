Forecasts suggest when the County Championship starts next Thursday the stars of the summer game will enjoy slightly milder conditions. In the mean time, several counties have been disrupted by the freeze. Arctic air has made it colder than Reykjavik in Iceland, following those sizzling temperatures of 70F (21C) last week. West Yorkshire woke up to deep snow yesterday, while Manchester and Durham also experienced significant drifts. The East Midlands and EastAnglia and parts of London had light flurries. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for snow and ice for much of the eastern side of Britain, where thundersnow - a wintry thunderstorm - has been observed.  One person tweeted: "Only in the UK can you go from sunbathing one day to scraping snow off your windscreen the next." There will be more wintry showers today but the Met Office predicted "a gradual trend towards less cold temperatures" over the weekend.
