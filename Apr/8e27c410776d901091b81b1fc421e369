The “socks and drugs and rock’n’roll” headlines were as inevitable as the off-stage ‘partying’ that followed. The Chilis aren’t as crazy now, but they’ve lost none of their creative energy. Their first album for six years is Scotch bonnet chili hot – engaging, euphoric and surprising in equal measure. Unlimited Love sees the California quartet reunited with guitarist John Frusciante – last heard on 2006’s Stadium Arcadium – and producer Rick Rubin, their reliably sharp long-time collaborator. It delivers what we want from the Chilis and takes risks too. There’s rap, funk and jazzy bass lines, of course, as well as the expected explosive refrains and maudlin riffs. But they also give us Tangelo, a soft acoustic ballad, and pop-grunge ditty These Are The Ways with its haunting melody and earworm hook. The Great Apes is closer to Jethro Tull. Less surprising are the lively hip hop boogie One Way Traffic and Here Ever After, a heavy, cantering rap song with another irresistible chorus. Bastards Of Light builds into an angry belter. Aquatic Mouth Dance is pure jazz-funk. Black Summer opens in a deceptively restrained mood with melancholy guitar licks. Singer Anthony Kiedis holds back as it builds slowly until it kicks in after 94 seconds. The chorus explodes with elation and John’s soaring guitar solo is sublime. The Chilis have always been about more than rock’n’roll excess. They’ve flogged 80 million albums worldwide, including mega-seller Californication. Instead of resting on their laurels, they have grown musically and produced something authentic, emotional and in places quite beautiful. It’ll blow your socks off. So be careful where you wear them.
