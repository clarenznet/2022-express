Researchers said the plant-based regime is linked to a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes in generally healthy people.Â Global cases of diabetes tripled from 150 million over the first 20 years of the century and are projected to hit 700 million by 2045. It can cause cardiovascular disease plus damage to the kidneys, eyes and the nervous system. Type 2 can be caused by poor diet, obesity and a lack of exercise. The US study team analysed blood plasma and the diets of more than 10,600 mostly white, middle-aged and overweight participants. Those diagnosed with the disease had a lower intake of healthy, plant-based foods. The team's findings have been published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.
