Seeing the Northern Lights, or the Aurora Borealis, is a goal for many travellers but can often be difficult to plan as it involves visiting Norway, Iceland or Sweden. Omega Travel has just launched discounts on seven night flights from the UK to see the Northern Lights, making it the perfect opportunity to tick it off the bucket list. Prices for these flights start from just £179 up. The deal includes special three-hour round trip and travellers can depart from regional airports including Gatwick, Edinburgh, Manchester, Gatwick and more. This offer saves customers £40 off usual prices and is available on trips late this year and next year. The flights will be led by expert astronomer and BBC Sky at Night regular Peter Lawrence, who will give expert commentary on the sights including the Milky Way and Orion’s Belt. To give the best view of the Northern Lights, the cabin will become as dark as possible so that your eyes can adapt to the darkness for the best view.
