I reluctantly accept you will be bombarded with adverts, that's how it makes its money based on tracking your browsing habits. But people have been banned or had posts removed by a monitoring system devoid of common sense or context. I was involved in an online spat about Harry and Meghan. The snowflakes were getting their knickers in a knot about racism allegations within the Royal Family. To illustrate Harry's hypocrisy, I posted an image of him in that German military fancy-dress uniform with swastika armband. I was suspended for "promoting Nazism"! Too many people are hiding behind Covid and need a kick up the backside to start using the office again, says Peter Rushton, from Chorley, Lancs. I'm sure Cambridgeshire County Council is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to empty buildings costing a fortune to maintain. It's no wonder there are delays in responses when dealing with public issues if nearly 70 per cent of staff are not at their desks. There needs to be a lot more scrutiny of where our money ends up.  Although I am not a member of the Conservative Party I have been helping my local Conservative councillor to get re-elected, saysÂ Derek Bennett, from Walsall, West Midlands. Over the years he has been dedicated and hard-working and has represented the ward I live in well. It would be a terrible injustice for him, and others like him, to lose their council seats because people want to punish Boris Johnson for past events in Downing Street. In such a case the voters will only be punishing themselves.
