The singer, 52, only had eyes for fiancé Ben as they strolled hand-in-hand 20 years after they first got engaged. The lovebirds were pictured on their way to pick up her daughter Emme from school in Los Angeles. J.Lo, who wore bell-bottom overalls and white T-shirt, gazed lovingly into Ben’s eyes a week after she announced he had proposed again. The couple first got together in 2002 before splitting up in 2004.
