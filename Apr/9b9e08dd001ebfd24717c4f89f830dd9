Pamela Anderson, 54, made sure to show that age is just a number as she left the ABC studios in New York earlier today. The actress looked great in a fitted white blouse, featuring frilled sleeves. The fitted blouse dress parted at the bottom after four buttons leaving the wind to risk a serious wardrobe malfunction. Under the dress Pamela sported a fitted black unitard and fishnet tights, leaving her toned legs on full display. Further highlighting her amazing figure, the Baywatch star chose nude thigh-high boots. She went for a red nail and wore her famous blonde tresses in a bun. Pamela also went for a smokey-eyed makeup look and a pale lip, so as not to take attention away from her glam figure. As she arrived at the event she slid her sensational figure into a skintight pink pencil skirt and a plunging white top. She styled the outfit with a cropped jacket that featured mirror work.
