The money saving expert answered viewer questions on ITV’s This Morning today and suggested how people can solve this dilemma. Suzanne called in saying she knows she could overpay her mortgage by 10 percent without a penalty. She wondered if she should reduce her mortgage by making such a payment. As she has around £8,000 in savings earning “next to no interest”, she asked the finance expert if she should be overpaying her mortgage with the money instead. Mr Lewis responded: “Is your mortgage rate higher than what you can earn in savings?” The first thing he explained to her was that she should not have savings that are earning “next to nothing”.

"We’ll put [the best interest rate] at 1.5 percent. “If it’s higher than 1.5 percent then it’s usually better off to pay your mortgage.” Mr Lewis explained that there are conditions people should consider before deciding. He stressed the importance of having some money in savings, ready to access before putting it anywhere else. He said: “There is a caveat though. “I would always keep three to six months worth of bills in savings that you can access before overpaying your mortgage.” The amount of money within an emergency fund worth three to six months will vary for every person. This will depend on their lifestyle, monthly costs, income, and dependents. Mr Lewis continued: “So you’re saying you have £8,000 - if you add it up and your bills are four or £5,000 over sixth months, then overpay with the £3,000 on top of that. “Provided the mortgage rate is higher than the savings rate and you don’t have any penalties. “If the mortgage rate is around the same as the savings rate then you’re better off just to save.” Martin Lewis is the Founder and Chair of MoneySavingExpert.com.
