Mr Orban secured a crushing victory during last weekend’s Hungarian parliamentary election, meaning he will now serve a fourth consecutive term as Prime Minister. Throughout his time in office, the 58-year-old has nurtured a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and despite condemning the invasion of Ukraine has refused to commit to all of the European Union’s (EU) sanctions regime.
