Mr Ellwood, the chairman of the Defence Select Committee, said the partygate scandal has caused "long term damage" to the Conservative "brand." He said this is now irreparable and has backed up his claims by repeatedly calling for Mr Johnson to resign. He told the BBC: "I fear it is now when not if a confidence motion takes place. All MPs are deeply troubled by this problem of what to do given where he has brought the party over the last couple of years. But the challenges just won't go away. I predicted a steady trickle of letters, of resignations, and that is now happening." Mark Harper, the former government chief whip, said that he expected a no-confidence vote by July. Mr Ellwood's comments come as Gavin Barwell, Theresa May's former Chief of Staff, said Number 10 should be "very worried" by Steve Baker's ⁠— who brutally called for Boris Johnson to quit ⁠— intervention.
