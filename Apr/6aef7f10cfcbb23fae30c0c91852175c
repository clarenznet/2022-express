Rescue teams fear their bodies, discovered face down in woods in Motyzhyn near Kyiv, were rigged with explosives. Olga's remains showed "signs of torture" with her arms and fingers having been broken, the mayor of the neighbouring village of Kopyliv said. The three were found behind houses used by Putin's troops as a barracks. Locals fear someone in the village turned "traitor" and revealed where Olga, the local mayor, lived. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, said: "These scum slaughtered and killed the whole family." "The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery." Vadym Tokar, head of the nearby village of Makariv, claimed the family were taken hostage on March 23. The Russians came to the Sukhenko home where they conducted searches and seized a car. It is claimed the Russians were "riding around the village" in Alexander's vehicle. Tetiana Semenova, an official of the Kyiv regional council, said: "They wanted to take Olga only but her husband insisted he would go with her. They also took away her son." In Olga's last Facebook post, after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being "someone else's scum in our village". One resident Daria said: "I don't have words to describe how I and my family feel."
