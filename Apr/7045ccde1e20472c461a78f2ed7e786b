Derek Brown, devoted husband and carer for his wife Margaret, is keen to flag this benefit. A tireless campaigner for the fair payment of council tax discounts to pensioners with the condition, he explained: “According to the government guidelines for councils even if you are exempt from the tax you are still eligible. “Councils are being given the money directly to pay for it. If your local authority has your current direct debit details they should pay the money automatically as early as possible in the 2022-23 financial year. “If a local authority does not hold those details, the guidance is they should ‘make all reasonable efforts to contact the household as early as possible to make them aware of the scheme and invite them to make a claim’.” For more guidance, visit sections 11 (iii) and 12, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-council-tax-rebate-2022-23-billing-authority-guidance/support-for-energy-bills-the-council-tax-rebate-2022-23-billing-authority-guidance
