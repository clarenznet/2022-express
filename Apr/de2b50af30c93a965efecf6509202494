But I don't remember many plaudits for his phenomenal achievement with Channel 5's 2001 endurance show Touch The Truck. It had a challenging premise - contestants held onto a stationary truck and the last person standing was the winner - but Dale kept the show running for an entire five episodes. Sadly, director Bastian GÃ¼nther can't hold our interest for two hours in this similarly themed drama. Early scenes introduce us to Kyle (Joe Cole), a desperate American fast-food worker who enters a vehicle-touching contest held outside a car showroom. Then it's simply a case of holding on for the next hour and-a-half as our hero and his thinly sketched rivals stand around and look tired.
