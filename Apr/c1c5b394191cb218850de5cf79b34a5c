NI payments are set to increase by 1.25 percentage points to help pay for social care and the NHS. In his March Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak also announced that from July 6 the NI payment threshold would increase from £190 per week to £242 per week. The changes were made in a bid to help those struggling with the escalating cost of living. Research by RIFT Tax Refunds found many workers said tax rises will place a further strain on their current financial situation.The survey of 1,017 working adults also found that 38 percent of people are not aware of the changes. RIFT found that just 58 percent of those surveyed were aware that this increase had been previously announced. And 50 percent did not realise it had been implemented this month.
