Rail, road, sea and air travel are all likely to be affected, experts warned. British Airways cancelled 74 flights yesterday, while easyJet axed 52, with plans to scrap 28 more today.  Both airlines blamed a shortage of staff due to Covid related absences. Manchester Airport posted a message on Twitter saying long queues had caused problems. A statement said: "As we continue to recover from the pandemic and passenger numbers grow, security queues may be longer than usual at times. We apologise to customers who have been impacted by the recent disruption."  Cross-Channel ferries will also be busy with many people heading off on foreign trips or returning over the two-week Easter school holidays. The Port of Dover said it handled 30,000 departing passengers last weekend, a three-fold increase on the corresponding weekend in 2021. Drivers are being warned to expect long delays next weekend as millions embark on an Easter getaway. People travelling over the Easter weekend are also set to face rail delays and cancellations due to engineering works.
