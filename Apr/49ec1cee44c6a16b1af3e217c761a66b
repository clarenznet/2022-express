Sony is about to reveal the PlayStation Plus free PS4 and PS5 games for May 2022. Assuming Sony sticks to its traditional schedule, the next wave of PS Plus freebies will be officially announced at 4.30pm BST on April 27. The PlayStation 4 and PS5 games will be available to download less than a week later, on the morning of May 3. In the run up to the big reveal, subscribers have been having fun predicting the line-up for May. In the monthly prediction thread on Reddit, subscribers have listed some of the games they believe will come to PS Plus in May. One of the games that has received lots of mentions is Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order on PS4/PS5. That's because it's Star Wars day on May 4th. Other games with multiple mentions include first-party release Sackboy: A Big Adventure, which was a PS5 launch title. Marvel's Avengers continues to feature heavily in the prediction thread, alongside NFS: Heat, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, NBA 2K22 and Lost Legacy. The more optimistic fans have listed games like Far Cry 6, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1&2, and Sekiro. The new games will replace the current line-up of Hood: Outlaws & Legends, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – Rehydrated and Slay the Spire. The highlight is Slay the Spire, which is a roguelike card game in which players must defeat enemies, battle bosses and slay the game's various bosses. "Embark on a journey up the ever-changing Spire, in this fantasy deckbuilder adventure that fuses together card games and roguelikes. "Craft a unique deck from hundreds of cards to efficiently dispatch foes and reach the top. Discover powerful relics to enhance your deck’s powers to help you overcome different enemies and bosses."
