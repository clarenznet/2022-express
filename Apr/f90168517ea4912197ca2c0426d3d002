Highlighting Russian exports to China, which rose by a third in the first quarter, she said the superpower "must play by the rules". "Beijing has not condemned Russia's aggression or its war crimes," Ms Truss told the Mansion House in the City of London. "They comment on who should or shouldn't be in Nato and are building a military capable of projecting power deep into areas of European strategic interest." She added: "But China needs trade with the G7. We represent half of the global economy. We have shown with Russia the kind of choices we're prepared to make when international rules are violated."
