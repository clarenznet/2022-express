Unlike a normal calendar the tax year - also referred to as the financial year - works from April 6 to April 5 of the following year. As a result the new period for paying tax will begin from Wednesday April 6, 2022, and is due to include several headline changes. Some of these were announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak little more than a week ago during his Spring Statement. There are two significant changes for the 2022/23 tax year. The first is that National Insurance contributions (NICs) will rise by 1.25 percentage points. According to the Government, this money will be spent on the UK’s NHS, health and social care.

However, as part of his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak has increased the threshold for National Insurance (NI) contributions by £3,000. The change will come into force from this July and means you won’t pay income tax or NI until you’re earning £12,570.

In fact, this is the first cut to the basic rate for 16 years. The personal allowance and higher-rate thresholds will be maintained at £12,570 and £50,270 for the 2022/23 tax year - these will remain frozen until April 2026.  From this month the rates of dividend tax are also due to rise by 1.25 percentage points, Investors pay dividend tax if they earn money from owning company shares. They will only be charged tax on the money they earn above the dividend allowance, which is £2,000 in 2022/23 - the same as the 2021/22 tax year. For basic-rate income taxpayers the dividend tax rate will increase from 7.5 percent to 8.75 percent. For higher-rate taxpayers, it will rise from 32.5 percent to 33.75 percent. Following recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, in October 2021, increases will be coming in for the rate of minimum wage you must pay employees.

The 2022/23 Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Business Rates scheme will provide eligible, occupied, retail, hospitality and leisure properties with a 50 percent relief, up to a cash cap limit of £110,000 per business. Two business rates reliefs will also be brought forward by a year. Meanwhile, there will be no business rates due on a range of green technology used to de-carbonise buildings, including solar panels and batteries, while eligible heat networks will also receive 100 percent relief.
