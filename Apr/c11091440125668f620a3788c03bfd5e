The Sussexes are set to travel to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games and are likely to be given full protection by the Dutch police as the event will also play host to the King of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander. The event marks the couple's first trip to Europe since the couple left the Royal Family after choosing not to return to the UK for Prince Philip's memorial in March due to security concerns. But a former royal protection officer told MailOnline they would have had the same protection as any royal at Westminster Abbey. Simon Morgan, a former royal protection officer, told MailOnline: "The Sussexes are attending an international event with veterans, many of whom were injured fighting the Taliban. Harry himself served in Afghanistan and he is the Queen's grandson. "The Dutch will consider the security threat as high, because for an extremist Invictus ticks a lot of boxes as a target for a spectacular attack. It is hard to fathom why Harry and Meghan would consider this less of a risk than going to Prince Philip's memorial service'. Meanwhile, Moniek Bloks, a Dutch royal biographer and Assistant Editor at Royal Central, said she believes Harry or his team are likely to ask the Queen's distant cousin King Willem if they can "hitch a ride" with their armed security.
