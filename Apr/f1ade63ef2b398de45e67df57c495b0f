Tom Pursglove said Britain spends around £5million a day accommodating people who cross the Channel in small boats. He said the short-term cost of the new scheme would be "pretty equivalent" to that. Home Secretary Priti Patel this week struck a £120million deal with Rwanda and cash for each removal is expected to follow. Mr Pursglove said: "As we move forward, we will continue to make contributions to Rwanda as they process the cases, in a manner that is similar to the amount of money we are spending on this currently here in the United Kingdom. "But longer term, by getting this under control, it should help us to save money." He said that the aim was to allow migrants to embark on "fully prosperous" lives in the central African country while crushing the business of people traffickers. But critics of the plan pointed to the sheer cost - estimated at up to £30,000 per person - and Rwanda's human rights record. Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell claimed it would be cheaper to put those arriving in Britain up at London's Ritz hotel for a year.
