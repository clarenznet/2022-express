But the former Cabinet minister who negotiated Brexit said the move had already been responsible for the Covid jabs success and had allowed Britain to “lead on Ukraine”. Lord Frost said: “There’s a lot we have done: the vaccine rollout, leading on Ukraine and restoring democracy to the country. Let’s not forget that is the most important point of Brexit. “In many EU countries, you can’t decide everything through elections – in this country we now can. “I would like to see us doing more, for example on planning reform, on procurement reform, on restoring flexible labour markets, reducing tariffs, going harder on free trade deals... so that some of the benefits start to be visible and pay off.”  Speaking on LBC radio, Lord Frost also warned the Northern Ireland protocol – which keeps the country subject to some EU laws – “isn’t working” and said Brussels should recognise it was only temporary. He added: “It must be renegotiated or the Government must act unilaterally.” UK and EU talks on renegotiating the protocol are continuing.
