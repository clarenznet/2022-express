Such a scenario would seem ludicrous if you suggested it might happen in 2024 yet that is exactly what took place in France this weekend. French politics is undergoing a political revolution that makes Brexit look like an undersized soggy baguette in comparison. With Sunday’s votes now counted it has been confirmed that for the second time in five years Emmanuel Macron will be in a final run-off with the right wing nationalist leader Marine Le Pen.But in some ways the story is what has happened to the traditional parties of government - the centre right Republicans and the centre left Socialists.Between them these two parties, which have dominated French politics since the World War 2, garnered a mere 6.38 percent of the vote - 4.78 percent for the Republicans’ Valerie Pecresse of the Republicans and 1.75 percent for the Socialist’s candidate Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris.Both lost their deposits and together their votes were less than the second placed far right candidate Eric Zemmour who came fourth overall on 7.07 percent.To put this in context it is as if the Conservatives and Labour were reduced to 6.38 percent of the votes between them in a general election.With two elections in a row giving largely the same result it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the traditional parties of power who underpinned democratic stability in France have been wiped out and now the French could very well elect a Far Right Government.More than two thirds of the French who bothered to go to the ballot box on Sunday backed extremist candidates from either the right or left over the moderate centrists.But what France is undergoing is very much linked to Brexit. The French, like the British in 2016, are fed up with the political elites who dominated the two main parties of power. Like the Oxbridge crowd in the Conservatives and Labour the French rulers got their training at the Sorbonne in Paris and have been separate to ordinary voters on the European Union project and greater integration, uncontrolled immigration, the cost of living and attacks on their standard of living.What might push Le Pen to victory is Macron’s desire to raise the state retirement age from 62 to 65, not unreasonable compared to Britain’s 67 but an outrage in the eyes of most ordinary French people.For them Paris - the home of the wealthy elites - has become a foreign country as London has for many British voting differently and with such a wave of immigration that it is unrecognisable from a few decades ago.Le Pen said: “The division is no longer right or left, it is globalists versus patriots.”Macron, who wants an EU army and a federal United States of Europe, who wants to take rights from ordinary French people to create more wealth for the elites, who wants open door immigration to bring down the cost of labour, is a poster boy for globalism. Le Pen has vowed to resist all these things and has attempted to ditch the antisemitic, racist legacy of her father Jean-Marie. A friend of the recently re-elected Viktor Orban in Hungary she presents a popular version of conservatism with socialist economics.For this reason it is she who may pick up most of the 8 million votes for far left Jean-Luc Merlenchon who came third.But if Le Pen completes this revolution, France’s version of Brexit, who among the centrist Rejoiners in Britain will want to shackle Britain to an EU where one of the two major countries is ruled by a far right President?Le Pen is no longer advocating withdrawal from the EU but her victory coupled with the disappearance of the two main ruling parties in France could spell the end of the Globalist European project in a way that Brexit alone never could achieve.
