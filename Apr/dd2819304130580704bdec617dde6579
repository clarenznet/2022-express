If you've been thinking of signing up to Amazon Kindle Unlimited for a while, now is the perfect time. The subscription service, which offers access to a library of over a million ebooks, usually costs £7.99 a month, but right now you can get three months access for the exact same price as just one. Yes, really. This marks a saving of £15.98 on the typical price of three months access to Kindle Unlimited (£23.97). It's been a while since Amazon ran a money-saving deal on Kindle Unlimited, so if you want to pick up a bargain deal on the service then don't delay. The Kindle Unlimited deal is only running until the end of the month with the promotion available until April 30, 2022. If you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber, you might notice some crossover between the Prime Reading library and Kindle Unlimited selection of books. Prime Reading is one of the many perks of being an Amazon Prime member, and as the name suggests it offers free access to ebooks.  But there are a few key differences - firstly, Prime Reading has a library of over a thousand books while for Kindle Unlimited its over a million ebooks. And with Prime Reading there's a limit on the amount of ebooks you can borrow at once while with Kindle Unlimited - as the name suggests - you can borrow as many books as you like at any given time. Kindle Unlimited also offers access to select magazine subscriptions as well as plenty of audiobooks thanks to thousands of books being available with Audible narration.   And for anyone that doesn't have a Kindle ereader but likes the sound of this service the good news is Kindle ebooks and the Kindle Unlimited service can be accessed across a wide range of devices. Besides Amazon's Kindle ebook range, you can read an Amazon ebook or access Kindle Unlimited via the dedicated Kindle app which is available on a variety of devices such as Amazon's Fire tablet range, iOS and Android devices as well as Mac and Windows machines.
