Charles Leclerc secured a dominant win ahead of Sergio Perez on the streets of Melbourne to mark his second victory of the new season at the Australian Grand Prix. The Ferrari driver led for the vast majority of the race and was simply too quick for the likes of Red Bull and Mercedes over the course of the 58-lap contest at the Albert Park Circuit. George Russell also managed to sneak onto the podium by coming home in third ahead of fourth-placed Lewis Hamilton after Max Verstappen was sensationally forced to retire in a cruel blow to his hopes of retaining his Drivers' Championship crown at the end of the season. The Dutchman looked set to register a second-placed finish and pick up a healthy number of points but was hit with an unfortunate mechanical issue during the closing stages of the race. The result saw Leclerc stretch his advantage at the top of the individual standings to cement his status as the early favourite for this year's Drivers' Championship title. However, it was a miserable outing for his Ferrari team-mate Carlos Sainz, who lost a number of positions early on before getting his car stuck in the gravel after just two laps of racing.
