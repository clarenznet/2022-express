"For too long our hard work and independent family-run businesses have been overlooked and undercut by the statutory fees framework and the police and highways authorities who employ us. It is extremely worrying operators are considering stopping work for police and highway authorities. "This will have a detrimental impact on public safety and mean an increase in violent crime carried out on our roads. Our industry is in its worst financial position for 50 years. The Government must act now before total road chaos ensues. This is why AVRO is calling for any increase in statutory fees to be paid directly to recovery operators." Peter Aldous, Conservative MP for Waveney, said: "It is crucial that our hard-working recovery operators feel supported by the Government and they receive fair payment for their work, which is often dangerous and crucial to all road users' safety." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "Police charges for vehicle recovery avoid costs being borne by the taxpayer and allow the police to remove vehicles that are potential obstructions and dangers on the road."
