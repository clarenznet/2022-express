Now is a very good time to go shopping for a new Samsung smartphone with Amazon offering huge discounts on a number of these hugely popular Android-powered gadgets. Right now you can pick up a Samsung call maker for as little as £144.08. That ludicrously low price is for the Galaxy A13 model which features a 6.6-inch screen, huge 5,000Ah battery and quad rear camera that can shoot stunning wide-angle and ultimate close-ups. THe A13 also gets expandable storage and is available in both black and white. This budget blower isn't the only device available in Samsung's sale with the online retailer also offering slightly more premium phones at a discounted rate including the Galaxy M23 5G and M52 5G. As the names suggest, both of these smartphones feature 5G technology which lets users whizz files and films to the device at speeds in excess of 300Mbps - that's around four times faster than the average UK broadband can muster. The M52 5G would usually cost £339 from Samsung but Amazon has slashed that price to just £269 - a saving of 21 percent. This phone includes a 6.7-inch screen, triple-lens camera and huge battery that should easily last a day and beyond. The Galaxy M52 5G also intelligently reads your phone usage pattern to provide up to 4GB of extra virtual RAM, allowing you to run apps smoothly and enjoy multitasking. It's available in Black, Blue or White. If £269 sounds a bit pricy the M23 5G might be one to take a look at with Amazon slashing the price of this device to just £209 - that's a £50 saving. As we mentioned earlier, this smartphone gets the power of 5G along with a 6.6-inch 120Hz screen, triple camera and expandable storage up to 1TB. The Galaxy M23 5G is also powered by the octa-core Snapdragon 750G Mobile Platform.
