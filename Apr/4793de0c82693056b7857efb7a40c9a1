 No Country for Old Men actress Kathy Lamkin died on April 4 after battling a “short illness”. Her family confirmed the news saying the star, who was also known for her role in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, would be greatly missed.       Kathy’s family told Deadline: “Kathy will be missed by her family and friends and left an impact on all she encountered during her life on this Earth.” The actress featured in a memorable scene opposite Javier Bardem in the American western No Country For Old Men – which won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 2008 SAG Awards. She was also known for her performance as The Tea Lady in the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The actress is survived by her husband of 52 years, Stephen L. Lamkin, her daughter Kati, her son Greg and her grandchildren Benjamin and Morgan.        Kathy appeared in several TV shows and films in the 1990s – from Miller & Mueller to Fools Gold. However, it was her turn as the Tea Lady in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that really put her on the map. She also starred in the 2006 prequel Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Kathy has starred in plenty of other films and shows between the 1990s and 2014, including  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Waiting For Guffman, Confession, In The Valley Of Elah, and The Heartbreak Kid.     Some might recognise her for her more recent roles in TV shows like Malcolm In The Middle, My Name Is Earl, Nip/Tuck, Bones, and Boston Legal. Kathy’s last on-screen appearance was in the 2014 film Chimeras, where she played Anita. The star’s fans took to social media to pay tribute to the late actress.
