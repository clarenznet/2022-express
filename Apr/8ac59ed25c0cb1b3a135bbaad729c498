Errol McKenzie, 37, was shot three times at close range in Leyton, east London, on April 11, 2010, after sitting on a bench to eat. His daughter and nephew, Nicole Bent and Ty McKenzie, said their family was "still suffering and struggling" with the killing and wanted closure.   Mr McKenzie said: "Just please, if you have any information, just come forward. My grandparents have been in pain for 12 years, just let them rest now. "It's time to close the case and let's get justice and put this to bed now and let everyone move on in life." Offering the reward, Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams said they hoped someone with information might have a "pang of conscience" and come forward.
