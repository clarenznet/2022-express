One year after Rachel Blackmore rode Minella Times to victory in 2021, the Randox Grand National returns on Saturday and you can enhance all the action with the Daily Express' free sweepstake kit. Once printed it is all simple from there - just cut out the names, put them in a bowl and then pick them out to let the games begin! Horse racing expertise is purely optional when it comes to the Grand National sweepstake, and it means everyone can get involved with the excitement. Just set an entry fee, decide whether the 'winner takes all', the top three get paid or whichever arrangement takes your fancy, sit on the edge of your seat and enjoy the race. The 2022 Grand National is due to get underway at 17:15 BST on Saturday. Express Sport has details of the sweepstake kit below: Simply click on the download link here, press print, cut the names out, get a group together and enjoy! It couldn't be any simpler. The big race will be shown live on ITV1, while UK-based viewers will also be able to stream the action on the ITVHub website or app. ITV1 shows live coverage of five races from Aintree on each day of the meeting, but the only place to watch every single contest is on Racing TV, which offers subscriptions from Â£10 for a day pass. The poetically-named Snow Leopardess leads the way with bookmakers for Saturday's race with Delta Work, who toppled Tiger Roll in the Cross Country Chase at Cheltenham, following shortly behind. Any Second Now is also among the favourites while last year's winner, Minella Times, is priced at 10/1 as he bids to become just the third horse since World War II to win the Grand National on two separate occasions.
