The Duke of Sussex, 37, sat down for an interview with the Today show's Hoda Kotb in the Netherlands, where he is currently hosting the Invictus Games. During the candid chat, Harry spoke to the anchor about his “really special relationship” with the Queen and praised her “sense of humour”. However, when asked whether he misses his brother and father, Harry swiftly dodged the question, insisting that he wanted to instead “focus” on the Invictus Games, and a body language expert claims this is because he was “feeling anxious or uncomfortable”. Speaking to Express.co.uk on behalf of Slingo, Darren Stanton said: “A significant moment was when Harry was asked specifically if he misses his dad Charles and brother William and he appeared to deflect the question. “Instead, he shifted the topic back to focus on his kids and living in California. Harry clasped his hands almost immediately - a gesture often used as self-reassurance when a person is feeling anxious or uncomfortable. “As soon as conversation turned back to living in LA, he unclasped his hands and his body relaxed.” The interview - which comes just over one year after Harry and Meghan’s bombshell sit down with Oprah Winfrey - also saw Harry opening up about his role as a father and about his late mother Princess Diana's “constant presence” in his life.
