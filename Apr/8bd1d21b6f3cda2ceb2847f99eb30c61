As the cost of living crisis continues to bite, Which? has found households can save hundreds of pounds on food by ditching expensive brands like Heinz, Innocent and Kelloggs and opting for supermarket own brands instead.  In a series of blind taste tests, the consumer champion has found that supermarkets own brands are not only cheaper when it comes to everyday essentials such as beans, orange juice and honey nut cornflakes, but sometimes they also taste better than their well-known branded counterparts. Which? found that six out of the eight groceries tested show that, for those willing to swap to supermarkets' own brands, shoppers could save themselves hundreds of pounds a year without compromising on taste. Which? found Lidl’s budget-friendly Newgate baked beans (32p for 420g, 8p per 100g) are the best value option. They cost less than half the price of Heinz beans (£1 for 415g tin). For shoppers buying two tins a week, switching from Heinz to Lidl could save more than £70 a year. Aldi’s The Juice Company Smooth Orange Juice is the best value option Which? tested - costing just £1.69 per 1.75L carton (10p per 100ml). Innocent orange juice was the priciest option (£3.60 for 1.35 litres, 27p per 100ml) and came in last place for taste. Overall, shoppers could save £99.32 a year by swapping expensive Innocent juice for Aldi’s budget option.

They were pitted against the best value cereal, Aldi’s Harvest Morn Honey Nut Crunchy Cornflakes which is only 85p per 500g pack, 17p per 100g. That is a saving of £2.15 per pack and £51.60 per year if they buy a box every two weeks. Testers compared popular peanut butter brands WholeEarth, Sun-Pat, and KP against supermarkets and again found Lidl’s Mister Choc Crunchy Peanut Butter is the best value pick, costing just 85p for 340g (25p per 100g). Sun-Pat, costing £2.50 per 400g jar (63p per 100g) was ranked near the bottom. Shoppers could save £1.65 per jar by switching to Lidl’s offering.

Opting for Lidl’s spread will save shoppers £1.81 per jar and £10.86 a year. Branded Marmite sets shoppers back £2.49 per 250g jar (£1 per 100g). Aldi’s Grandessa Mighty Yeast Extract was ranked at the top for taste and only costs £1.69 per 240g jar (70p per 100g), saving £4.80 per year. While the top brands couldn’t always be beaten on taste, Which? found supermarkets offer great value alternatives. While Nescafe Original (up to £5.50 a jar, £2.75 per 100g) could not be beaten on taste, Aldi’s cheap instant coffee costs less than half as much per 100g, offering a potential saving of £3.85. Heinz Tomato Ketchup was a firm favourite in terms of taste, but sets shoppers back £2.30 for 460g (50p per 100g). Sainsbury’s Tomato Ketchup is the best value for money at 60p for 460g (13p per 100g), saving £1.70. Natalie Hitchins, Which? Head of Home Products and Services, said: “No one wants to overpay for basic groceries, especially when the cost of living crisis is putting huge pressure on household budgets. “Shopping around and buying own-brand products is an easy way to save hundreds of pounds a year. “Those prepared to switch to a cheaper supermarket for their regular shop will likely find some great value alternatives to their favourite brands - with many even beating their well-known rivals for taste in Which?’s tests.” Notes: Each product category was tested and rated by a panel of 60+ consumers who regularly buy and consume that product. The make-up of the panel broadly represents the demographic profile of adults in the UK. The panellists rate each product in a fully rotated order and the taste tests are conducted blind, so they don’t know which brand they are trying. Each panellist has a private booth so they can’t discuss what they are tasting or be influenced by others.
