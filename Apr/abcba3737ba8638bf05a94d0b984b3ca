The EU's chief finance commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, compared the bloc’s reliance on the City of London to its dependence on Russian oil and gas. Addressing a European Central Bank event on Wednesday, she said: "It's time now for Europe, the EU of 27, to make very strong decisions on the financial stability and the financial system, just as we are doing today very critically and very urgently around our over-dependency on energy from Russia.” Ms McGuinness added: "We do need to watch out for areas where we are vulnerable to decisions made outside the EU, and therefore, beyond our control... we need to watch for vulnerabilities in capital and financial services.” Andy Mayer from the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank in London, hit back: "The commissioner’s crass comparison between an ally and a hostile power engaging in an illegal war on European soil is deeply regrettable."
