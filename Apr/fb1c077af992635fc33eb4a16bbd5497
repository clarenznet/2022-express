This Morning star Holly Willoughby and Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden both stunned earlier today as they turned up to work in the same floral dress. Onlookers could scarcely believe their eyes as the glamorous pair rocked exactly the same outfit. Mother of two Amanda, 51, paired the cream and blue floral print outfit with white heels and a white handbag when she set off to work today at the Heart FM studios in London. She also donned a pair of chic sunglasses in a nod to the spring sunshine and warmer temperatures heading to the UK. Meanwhile, Holly offered her own take on the feminine puff sleeve dress when she got to the ITV studios to film This Morning. The dress was more demure than some of her previous outfits, which caused criticism by some for being too revealing when she presented evening show Dancing On Ice. However today the 41-year-old star, who modelled as a teenager before deciding on a TV career, is exactly matching Amanda in the style stakes. Both women have previously made the headlines for their memorable dress sense. Amanda recently showed up to the BGT auditions wowing onlookers in a shining pink latex dress, combined with pink and orange heels. She looked a mere fraction of her age in the glamorous outfit. Meanwhile Holly's sizzling style moments have included an eye-popping pair of black leather shorts, which attracted over 100,000 likes in a matter of hours.
