Elba entertained guests at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding by putting on a memorable DJ set during the private evening reception. BBC’s 1Xtra Rap host Tiffany Calver asked Mr Elba: “What is the vibe of a Harry and Meghan wedding? What tune was the one that got everyone going crazy?“ To which he said guests "went off" at Whitney Houston‘s I Want to Dance with Somebody and that the Duchess specifically requested Dr Dre’s Still D.R.E. This is the first time to get such details, as back in 2019 when he was asked to disclose what songs made the set, Mr Elba said: "I'm not gonna put their business out like that, that's not fair. Ask Meghan and Harry." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
