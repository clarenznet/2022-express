Melani, 33, was berated by a bus driver in Palma due to her six-month-old son crying, apparently causing a disturbance. Dealing with a crying baby on public transport is difficult enough. But the added stress of an angry bus driver can cause further strain. Mum-of-two Melani said: "He told me my six-month-old baby had bothered the entire bus full of passengers with his crying during the trip." She added that the driver accused her of not being able to calm her own child down, she told Olive Press.

She said that the bus driver told her she would be better off asking for a "taxi" next time. But while the bus driver was clearly upset and distracted by the baby's cries, Melani believed that he was the only affected person. According to the mum, none of the other passengers appeared bothered. What's more, as far as she was concerned, the other bus goers enjoyed the baby's presence. She recalled some passengers smiling, making faces and playing games with her son. Subsequently, Melani filed a police report, believing that the way she had been treated was unjust. This complaint was issued to the National Police in Palma.  Melani also issued a formal complaint to the bus company. Palma is is located in Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands.
