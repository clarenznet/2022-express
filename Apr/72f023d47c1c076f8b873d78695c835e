All bars and restaurants in Spain are now required by law to offer free tap water as an alternative to bottled water, which customers would have previously had to pay for. It's been introduced in a bid to help people reduce the consumption of plastics - but it'll also benefit tourists dining out at abundant restaurants in holiday hotspots, including Benidorm. Up until now, businesses could choose whether they want to offer tap water and could decide whether to charge for it or not. But the new regulations in the Law on Waste and Contaminated Soil for a Circular Economy state: "Establishments in the hotel and restaurant sector will always have to offer consumers, customers or users of their services the possibility of consuming unpackaged water free of charge and complementary to the offer of the same establishment." Water fountains are also being encouraged to be installed so visitors and locals can refill their reusable bottles throughout the day. And, as Glasgow Live reports, the change has been largely celebrated. One man stated online: "About time, the Spanish government stepped in to stop this rip off practice. But let's face it, any tourist trap anywhere in the world, rips off tourists." Another Facebook user posted: Great news. To think of the amount of money we wasted on bottle water over there." A third said: "Well done, Spain." Another man shared: "This is a game changer." When plastic water bottles end up in landfills, they still absorb and leach toxic chemicals as they break up into tiny polluted pieces.
