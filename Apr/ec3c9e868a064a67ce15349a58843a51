The Queen’s granddaughter looked stylish as she watched from the stands, sporting a rather demure look. The Olympian wore a navy blazer over the top of a high-necked fuchsia blouse. She accessorised the look with a pair of round, tortoiseshell glasses and a flat, large-rimmed navy blue hat decorated with a rose and an assortment of leaves. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall opted for a forest green coat, which she decorated with a couple of broaches. Camilla, who is married to Prince Charles, accessorised with a white and gold patterned scarf and some pearl earrings. The Duchess also kept her head warm with a soft, fluffy brown hat.The Grand National is a National Hunt horse race that has been held annually at Aintree Racecourse in Liverpool since 1839.
