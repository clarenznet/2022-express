A Downing Street source told the Sunday Express that 20 fines were issued last week to junior staff and senior figures will receive penalties this week. There is speculation that a fine could be given to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside his wife Carrie and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. A senior backbencher, who wrote a letter demanding a leadership election, said: “Boris is definitely not out of the woods yet.” The MP added: “Obviously, Ukraine has bought Mr Johnson time and also helped strengthen his position. “We cannot change leader in the middle of a war but that does not mean we will not revisit this issue. “There are problems with the cost of living in particular that the Government is not tackling and if the local elections are bad then we will see letters go in again.” The Met said the fines were issued in a “first tranche” indicating more could be handed out shortly. Over 100 questionnaires were sent out to Whitehall and No10 officials who were allegedly in attendance. Civil servants are not obliged to share if they have received a £50 fixed-penalty notice and no breakdown of the events being investigated has been provided. Downing Street has said it will provide an update if Boris Johnson is fined.  Mr Johnson is believed to have attended several of the gatherings under investigation but has refused to accept that he has broken the law. His allies suggest that if he is issued with a penalty he would not resign. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the fines meant “we now know there was widespread criminality”. So what do YOU think? Should Boris Johnson resign if fined by Met Police over lockdown parties? And do you care if Boris attended a lockdown party? Vote in our poll and leave your thoughts in the comment section below.
