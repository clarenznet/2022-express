Magistrates yesterday issued an order paving the way for him to face espionage charges. Home Secretary Priti Patel will now be responsible for deciding whether to approve his deportation after a protracted legal battle. An extradition order was issued by chief magistrate Paul Goldspring at Westminster magistrates court. But it may be further delayed by an appeal from Assange. He has been held in Belmarsh prison in south-east London for three years since being dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in central London. Assange, 50, who watched by video from prison, faces up to 175 years in a US jail for an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose defence data. It follows publication of documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
