Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a new tax plan as part of his Spring Statement as a means to address pressures on the Government to act on the UK’s spiralling costs of living crisis. The new changes are due to come into effect at the start of the new financial year on April 6, 2022. Unlike traditional years running from January to February, financial years in the UK run from April to April. This year, the UK 2021/2022 financial year will end on Tuesday, April 5, and 2022/2023’s financial year will begin on Wednesday, April 6. There are two major changes coming into place this financial year around National Insurance (NI). However, both are commencing on different dates. The first change, due to take place on April 6, is a rise in National Insurance paid by employees and self-employed workers. The 2022/2023 tax year will see 1.25 percent added to the current NI rate, bringing the figure a typical employee would pay from 12 percent of their weekly earnings to 13.25 percent. This increase was reportedly introduced to support social care and the NHS. Secondly, the annual NI primary threshold is due to be increased by £3,000.

New changes mean employees can now earn up to £12,570 before they start contributing. However, this increased threshold will not come into effect until July 2022. There have been no new announcements for income tax for the 2022/2023 financial year meaning the tax brackets and charges will remain unchanged. However, 2023/2024’s financial year should see a drop in income tax from 20p in the pound to 19p. Currently, the tax-free amount you can earn in the UK remains at £12,570 for the financial year ahead, and basic rate limit (20 percent tax bracket) will stay at £37,700  But what does all of this mean? To work out how much tax you’ll pay, first figure out what tax bracket your annual salary falls into.   To work out how much income tax you will pay based on this chart, you should split your annual salary out into bands. For example, if you were to earn an annual salary of £30,000, you’d be paying the basic rate tax. This means £12,570 of your earnings will be tax-free, but the remaining £17,430 will fall into basic rate, of which you’ll be taxed 20 percent of it.

This means, as above, £12,570 of your earnings would be tax-free, earnings from £12,570 to £50,271 (£37,701) will be taxed 20 percent, and the remaining £4,729 will be taxed 40 percent. NI is also based on bands, and the amounts deducted from your payslip depend on your NI category letter, and how much of your earnings fall within each band. Most employees are on category letter A, but you can find this out on your payslip. For example: Category letter A - 0 percent £120 to £184 per week - 12 percent £184 to £967 per week - two percent over £967 a week. You can find the full list of bands from A to Z here.  Likewise to income tax, your weekly earnings will be split into the three thresholds above and the total figure will amount to your NI contribution per week. This total will then be multiplied by however many weeks in the month, and that will be the figure you contribute towards NI per month. Here’s a good calculator to find out how much income tax and NI you’ll have to pay if you don’t want to work it out manually. This financial year tradition dates back to 1752 when the UK’s Julian calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar, which uses a solar dating system. As a means to tackle the ‘leap year’ issue this created and preserve revenue, the British Treasury decided to keep the 1752/53 tax year as 365 days. From then on, the tax year would end on April 4th, with the new one beginning on April 5th. However, this was pushed forward by one day in 1800, due to there being no Gregorian leap year but instead being a Julian one, and this event gave us the dates we use today.
