The UK's former chief Brexit negotiator was responding to a tweet from the author Bruno Macaes. Mr Macaes wrote that many believed Brexit would weaken Europe vis a vis Russia, but this turned out to be an "absurd" notion. He claimed that Berlin's relationship with Moscow had done more to undermine European security.
