Dustin Johnson's fiancee Paulina Gretzky has stunned with her racy hen party looks ahead of her wedding to the American pro-golfer. The actress, 33, shared a video of her luxury hen party which saw her don multiple dazzling outfits as she partied with close friends ahead of her nuptials. It comes as her beau Dustin takes part in day two of the 2022 Masters, which is being held at the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia. Kicking off her hen party, Paulina revealed to her one million Instagram followers that she was jetting off to Saint Barthelemy with her nearest and dearest. Posting on the steps of a private jet, the actress stunned while standing in a simple white bandeau dress that showcased her incredible figure, which she accessorised with a white cowboy hat and trainers. She captioned the post: "P's last Do." Two days later, the star shared a video montage of her hen party on the exotic island which featured her in a number of stunning outfits. The star could be seen strolling around the tropical location in white swimwear complete with a sheer skirt that only just covered her rear.
