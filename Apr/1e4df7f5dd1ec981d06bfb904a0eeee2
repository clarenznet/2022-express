  TV chef Jamie Oliver, 46, would cause his family to dread him filming his TV shows from home in lockdown thanks to his short temper and “moody” attitude, according to his wife Jools, 47. Jools recently revealed that she would often end up in tears when Jamie was forced to film his TV cooking shows from their family home due to the coronavirus pandemic.      Jools claimed that there were “so many times she’d be left crying” over lockdown thanks to her husband Jamie’s intense filming regime. She explained that, while the couple had previously been able to separate their work and family life, things changed during the pandemic. Once COVID-19 struck the nation, children’s clothing designer Jools found herself having to act as “producer” and “camerawoman” for her husband’s show. She spoke to fellow mum of five, pop star Sophie Ellis-Bextor, on the Spinning Plates podcast about the strain the pandemic put on herself and Jamie.

It's kind of ‘ahh!’” As the creator of children's clothing brand, Little Bird, Jools found herself taking up an entirely new task over lockdown, as she was forced to film Jamie’s new show Keep Cooking and Carry On using just her mobile phone. “It was stressful because he was just so full on,” she admitted. “And he was really enthusiastic, and he was treating it like I was a producer and I was a camerawoman and I knew everything." She continued: “And there were so many times that I'd be crying and I'd go, ‘I don't want to do this,’ and he'd go, ‘Right, get on, do it now’, and I'd think, ‘This is so not natural to me’.      “It was all such a bonkers time. I don't know how we all came out of it pretty much normal. “He just used to lose his temper a bit. It's just he just used to get so moody. “I thought, 'Hang on a minute', And then he'd realise when I got upset that actually it's not my job.” To make matters worse, the couple had to film in the coldest part of their house because it had the best light and would have to move sofas against walls to block out external noise.

However, she also added that she would often feel “worried” because the activities were so “messy and dirty” that she could become preoccupied with cleaning up after them. Jools explained how Jamie wanted her to focus on his filming for two hours each morning, which left her “worrying about everything” due to the added pressure of home schooling their many children. Nevertheless, the designer added that it was “good to be together” during such an odd time for everyone in the UK and fondly remembered dancing around the kitchen with their kids.      The former model added that they were generally “just a normal family”, despite her husband’s TV fame. Jamie and Jools have been married for over two decades, tying the knot back in 2000. The pair are proud parents to five children: Poppy, 19, Daisy, 18, Petal, 12, Buddy, 11, and five-year-old River. The podcast Spinning Plates with Sophie Ellis-Bextor is available on streaming platforms now.
