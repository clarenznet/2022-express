Naomi Campbell, 51, attended a funeral service held for André Leon Talley in New York on Friday. The model arrived wearing an all-white outfit complete with a bold fur coat, a tiny mini dress and matching fascinator. Hundreds of mourners will attend the service, including Anna Wintour and fashion designer Marc Jacobs. André was mourned by the fashion industry when he died at his New York home in January of a heart attack aged 73. He was the first black creative director and later editor-at-large of Vogue US. Before joining Vogue in 1983, he worked at Andy Warhol’s Interview Magazine and Women’s Wear Daily. He moved to Paris in 1995 and returned to W Magazine after working at the publication earlier in his career. André continued contributing to Vogue as an editor until he rejoined in 1998 full-time as the editor-at-large, writing the monthly column Style Fax. He remained in this role until his final departure in 2013.
