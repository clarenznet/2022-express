Richard will be joined by our host Pandora Forsyth to discuss the latest developments in the Royal Family as the Queen admits her exhaustion after "horrid" Covid battle and Harry's memoir which has been described as 'intimate and heartfelt' by his publisher. The Queen made headlines as she opened up on her Covid hell while on a virtual visit to the Royal London Hospital over the weekend. She tested positive for the virus in February, just two days after Prince Charles revealed he had also caught it. While the monarch spoke to a patient who was treated at the unit, she admitted it left her feeling very tired and exhausted.
