While in the Netherlands for the Invictus Games Harry sat down for a candid chat with the Today show’s anchor Hoda Kotb where he talked about how his security issues may impact any potential trip to the UK for Jubilee celebrations. In his interview, the Duke also said he paid a visit to his grandmother last week to make sure she was “protected” and “had the right people around her”. Nile Gardiner, who served as a foreign policy researcher for the Iron Lady from 2000 to 2002, took to Twitter to voice his thoughts on Harry’s recent television interview and savaged the Sussexes in the process. The foreign analyst wrote: “The stunning decline of Prince Harry.
