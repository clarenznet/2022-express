British Airways axed at least 78 services at Heathrow while easyJet cancelled at least 30 at Gatwick. Disruption is blamed on staff shortages caused by Covid and job cuts. Those who did get away to Spain were touching down to cold and rain, wrecked beaches and a requirement to wear masks indoors. Costas Blanca and Del Sol were due to be colder than London and a touch warmer than Manchester at 12C (53F) yesterday after gales had destroyed sands leaving debris including upturned sun loungers. Tourist chiefs were racing to refill beaches with dredged sand for Easter week. Miguel Muncharaz, manager of Marbella's Trocadero Playa, said: "The last storm has devastated this place. It's a disaster." British tourist Dave Prentice, who has a holiday home near Benidorm, said: "I was hoping to go home with a tan but since I got here last week all I've seen is rain and more rain."
