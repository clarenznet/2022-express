In that time he has reported from Westminster across TV, radio and online, as well as hosting BBC Radio 4's Any Questions? since 2019. Chris, 41, said: "What a tremendous privilege to take on what, for me, is the most extraordinary job in British broadcasting and journalism.  "I clamber upon the shoulders of giants like Laura, Nick [Robinson] and Andrew [Marr] with a smattering of trepidation and a shedload of excitement and enthusiasm. "To lead the best team of journalists on the best news patch of the lot is something I'd never even dared dream of. I can't wait to get started." Kuenssberg, 45, was last month announced as the new host of the BBC's Sunday morning politics show, replacing Marr. She has been political editor since 2015 and her final assignment will be to cover next month's local elections. The corporation's latest annual report shows she earned between £260,000 and £264,999 a year.  Jonathan Munro, interim director of BBC News, called Mason "an exceptional correspondent". He said: "His calm, incisive analysis and signature candid style have been invaluable for audiences when navigating complex stories." Mason began his career as an ITN trainee before becoming BBC Radio 5 Live's political reporter. While there he co-hosted Question Time Extra Time and spent two years in Brussels as a Europe correspondent. He was also co-presenter of political talkshow Brexitcast and still regularly appears on the Newscast podcast.  Sophy Ridge, who presents the Sky News Sunday morning politics show, and Anushka Asthana, deputy political editor of ITV News, were named as frontrunners for the post. But reports last week suggested Mason and Adam Fleming, a co-presenter of Newscast and a long-standing friend, were the final candidates. Fleming tweeted of Mason's promotion: "Congrats to my journalistic twin brother I'm so proud of you." Kuenssberg tweeted: "Huge congrats and welcome to colleague, great friend and newscaster Chris Mason."
