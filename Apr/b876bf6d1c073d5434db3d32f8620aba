Ferrari will be hoping they can make home advantage count at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix this weekend, with a sea of red expected among the stands at  Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari. After three races so far this season, the Prancing Horse's Charles Leclerc already has a healthy lead in the Drivers Championship standings, sitting on 71 points thanks to two wins and a second place. It has been a promising start to the season for Leclerc and Ferrari, but there is a long way to go yet.   Click here if the form above does not work. Leclerc is 34 points clear of second-place George Russell, who has so far outperformed Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, achieving a podium finish last time out in Australia. Hamilton currently sits in fifth, one place and three points above last year's title rival Max Verstappen, whose Red Bull car has been plagued with reliability problems that have seen him fail to finish two out of the three races so far. Verstappen has so far looked more competitive than his great rival, winning the Saudi Arabia GP before retiring from second place in Australia. Will this change as the season heads to Europe for the first time or will last season's frontrunners continue to fall further behind? Have your say on how you think the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix will go this weekend in the survey above.
