While Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is now one of the most famous faces in the Royal Family, she only became a royal 17 years ago today after marrying the future King, Prince Charles. Camilla and Charles' relationship attracted significant controversy in the 1990s, and both of their previous marriages ended in divorce. But the couple finally made things official with a smaller-scale royal wedding in Windsor on April 9, 2005.
