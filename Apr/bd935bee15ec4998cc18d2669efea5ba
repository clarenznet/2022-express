She admitted she “can’t stand” the word “cougar”, as she pointed out how women are judged for age gap romances “far more” than men. The TV star said: "He's 38, for God's sake. He said, not so long ago, 'Surely I'm not still your toyboy, am I?' I laugh about it now but it does annoy me. "And I hate that word cougar. I can't stand it. I find it so demeaning. "A cougar is a predator going around looking for young flesh. I'm certainly not like that. "But then, women are judged far more harshly than men - and, funnily enough, often by other women.”
