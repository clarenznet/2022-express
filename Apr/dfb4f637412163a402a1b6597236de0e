The only exception to this is if the gift is part of a trust. If the gift giver dies within seven years, there could be inheritance tax to pay. The exact amount of tax due depends on when the gift was given. Gifts given in the three years before death are taxed at a rate of 40 percent. Any gifts given between three and seven years before death are taxed on a sliding scale which is known as "taper relief". A gift given three to four years before death will be taxed at 32 percent. For gifts given between four and five years before death, it is 24 percent. The rate reduces again for gifts given five to six years before death, down to 16 percent. Gifts given six to seven years before death will be taxed at eight percent. And of course, for gifts given seven or more years before death, there is usually no tax to pay.
