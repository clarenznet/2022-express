Easter Monday falls on April 18 this year. The bank holiday weekend sees shops and supermarkets changing their opening hours. Although many shops in England closed on Easter Sunday, most will reopen on Easter Monday. However, because it is a bank holiday, opening hours may be slightly different compared with a standard Monday. The hours your local shops are open may also vary depending on where in the UK you live. The best way to confirm the opening hours of your local store is to visit the retailer's website.
