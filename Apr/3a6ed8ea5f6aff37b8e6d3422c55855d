Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his call for the West to impose a blanket embargo on Moscow's energy products and to urgently supply the Ukraine with more arms. In a TV address, he said Russia's invasion was "a catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone", including the "whole European project".  He said: "This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war." But Ukraine will not meet representatives from Moscow until after Russia's defeat. British military intelligence says it has more evidence Russia is targeting civilians. Moscow is also recruiting ex-soldiers discharged up to a decade ago to replace growing losses.
