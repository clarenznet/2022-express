The woman, who has the username Shena P on TripAdvisor, took to the review website following her visit to a Greggs in Bangor, north Wales. She and her partner ordered aÂ sausage roll, vanilla slice and tea to enjoy in the bakery but were told there would be a 20p surcharge. And Shena noticed all the other customers in the branch were Welsh speaking. Leaving a two-out-five-star review on the site, the woman posted: "My partner and I ordered a sausage roll, vanilla slice and tea to eat/drink inside. However, to our surprise, the young man who served told us there would be a 20p charge to sit inside. "We have visited many Greggs shops in England and Scotland but never been charged to sit down. Is this something that is only done in North Wales - if so why? We noticed that all other customers that sat down around us were Welsh speaking and none were charged 20p to sit down. I have sent a private message to Greggs regarding this matter and would like an explanation." But Wales Online reports Shena may have in fact been mistaken.  All Greggs stores across the UK charge different prices for people wanting to eat on the premises. Although Shena believes she has never been charged extra in England and Scotland, she actually would have been due to VAT. A spokesperson from the bakery chain cleared up the mix-up and said: "We're legally obliged to include VAT for all for food eaten within our seating area. "However, this isn't a one-off charge. This is per item, not per visit." The Bangor branch has an average rating on TripAdvisor of three and a half stars out of five, with guest praising its sausage rolls and "polite and friendly" staff.
