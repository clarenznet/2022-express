Nessy was found in Bucha during the liberation of the area from the Russian invaders. The poor animal was separated from its owner a few weeks ago. Luckily, she was found by Belarusian soldiers volunteering in Ukraine as members of the Kastus Kalinouskiv Battalion. The soldiers helped locate the owner of the lost dog and arranged for the reunion. Footage of the moment led to an outpouring of emotion on social media. The post on Kastus Kalinouskiv Battalion's Facebook page said: “A little positive in these difficult times. “During Bucha's release we found Nessy, the dog, left alone. “But thanks to our friends we found her hosts and today she is back to them. “Look at this emotional moment." The post continued: “As long as some treat people like animals, we are fighting for the lives of not only humans but every animal!” The video has gone viral - and has been shared by animal rights organisations in Ukraine, such as UAnimals.

Slava Ukraine!” Another user, thought to be a Ukrainian citizen, shared their tragic experience in the war as a pet owner. Marishka Solyarchuk said hasn’t left her home because she is concerned about abandoning her cats. She wrote: “I remember before the war, the topic of evacuation or even shelter in shelters was raised in conversations. “My acquaintances said: ‘I will not leave the city because I have a dog / cat’, ‘if they do not let me go to the shelter with my pet, I will not go’, ‘And where should I go when I have five cats’, etc. “We immediately decided that we could not go anywhere, because the cat is very antisocial and completely inappropriate, hysterical, behaves outside the home. “I can not leave a family member who loves me for over 10 years, and the trip is a death knell for her.
