New Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag does not want Marcus Rashford to be sold. The attacker wants to stay at his boyhood club despite poor form having seen him linked with a move away from Old Trafford. And Ten Hag has made clear to United's CEO Richard Arnold, per reports, that he wants to revitalise Rashford's career in the north west. Rashford has scored a paltry five goals all season, and has gone from being a starting figure for the Red Devils to being on the periphery of Ralf Rangnick's squad. But with the appointment of Ten Hag, there is a renewed belief on Rashford's behalf that he can reignite his United career again and get back to his best. The Dutchman plays attacking football with an emphasis on the wide-men which should suit Rashford, and he could flourish under the new boss. And according to the Daily Star, Rashford is expected to sit down with United chiefs once Ten Hag arrives to talk about a new and improved contract. The Wythenshawe-born star is pleased with the appointment and is keen to work hard to see if Ten Hag can revive his flailing career.
