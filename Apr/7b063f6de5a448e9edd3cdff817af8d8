The US tech giant – which owns YouTube – said it is committed to upholding “all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws”. The move drew an angry response from the Duma’s chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who accused the United States of trying to achieve a “monopoly of information”. “It is another proof of Washington’s violation of rights and freedoms,” he told Russian news agency Tass. “Washington is ignoring all the principles of democracy to make sure that all platforms present only the US position.” A Google spokesman said: “If we find that an account violates our terms of service, we take appropriate action. “Our teams are closely monitoring the situation for any updates and changes.” The move comes after YouTube last month removed a Russian prank channel which ran clips of hoax calls, purportedly from Ukrainian ministers, to UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel.
