Antonio Rudiger has reportedly ruled out a move to Manchester United this summer. Rudiger is out of contract at Chelsea at the end of this season and could leave on a free transfer. United are one of a host of top clubs to be linked with the German. However, the Red Devils appear to be an unlikely destination for the 29-year-old. CBS Sports reporter Ben Jacobs claims Rudiger has decided against moving to United. Jacobs says Rudiger has not decided where he will be playing his football next season. However, there are three clubs who see him as a 'big priority'. They are Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and his current club Chelsea.
