But a drubbing in next month's local elections could add more pressure. It comes as a poll for the Sunday Express byTechne has revealed that 55 per cent of people believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak should resign over the fines for breaking lockdown rules.  Another aide said: "We have seen plenty of supportive messages from MPs who were, two months ago, ready to put in no-confidence letters." However, Tory backbenchers told the Sunday Express that a bad set of results in the May 5 local elections could spark a challenge to his leadership. One veteran MP said: "We are staring at a wipeout because voters are still angry about Partygate. If it is really bad then colleagues will panic about their seats."  However, only 10 per cent of Conservative voters and 39 per cent of Leave supporters believe the Prime Minister should quit, showing that core support for theTories is weighing in behind the Prime Minister. Insiders said it was a move to the right politically which has helped save the Prime Minister from a potential coup. One senior Tory source said: "MPs have been pleased with the Number 10 reset. "While the noise was intense, last week the focus remained squarely on the historic announcement by the Home Secretary [on processing asylum claims in Rwanda]. A key manifesto pledge has been met, we are showing voters/MPs we are serious about taking back control of our borders."  And a former minister said: "It is hard to see how Boris can lead us into the next election." If he goes, polling byTechne revealed Defence Secretary BenWallace is favourite to be the next PM with 16 percent and is the most favoured by Tory voters. He is ahead of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on 13 percent, Home Secretary Priti Patel on five percent, and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak both on four percent.
