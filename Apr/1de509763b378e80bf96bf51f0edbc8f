What pensioners want and need is immediate monetary assistance from a Government which most of us voted for, to make some inroads into our financial survival. Instead of sending those billions of pounds to other countries in foreign aid, make the living standards of pensioners in the UK at least comparable with other countries. Local elections on May 5 and the expected general election in 2024 may see a big voting swing from the pensioners, and it won’t be to the Conservatives. Neil Snow, Eastleigh, Hants -------------------------------------------- MPs don’t understand the real meaning of poverty I wonder how those on the breadline and in low-paid jobs feel seeing the Government still giving billions of pounds in foreign aid, including to countries with space and nuclear programmes? Then there is the money used to feed and house those who have arrived here by illegal methods and have paid nothing into the system. MPs with their wages and pensions do not realise the suffering of many poorer families. They should remember someone has to do the menial tasks that keep the country going. Tony Glasson, Bromham, Beds -------------------------------------------- Rayner’s critics haven’t crossed line with remarks All this outrage over a comment about Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner supposedly crossing and uncrossing her legs, anyone would think she had been called “scum” (“PM: Rayner jibe MP will face ‘terrors of the earth’”, April 26). Stefan Badham, Portsmouth, Hants --------------------------------------------  Legs row is a farce – but Kenny would have liked it What a farce all of this alleged leg crossing by Angela Rayner is. As comedian Kenny Everett would have said: “It’s all done in the best possible taste.” Nicola Bailey, Mold, Flint
