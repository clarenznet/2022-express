The Duchess of Cambridge reportedly follows a simple beauty routine which consists of using a couple of skincare products and an affordable item every day before going to bed. It is believed the royal likes to use a face flannel to cleanse her face. The towel can be used to simply wash the face with a bit of soap or face wash as well as to remove any excess make-up. Kate's make-up artist Arabella Preston said this is the best routine to follow after a long day to remove any dirt and make-up. Face flannels are a great option to cleanse the skin and gently exfoliate it at the same time.

"Think of your parents: how did they wash you when you were a kid? "They used a flannel. "They are more substantial than wipes or muslin, are far more effective at removing dirt, and help exfoliate the skin, too.”  She continued: “You don’t have to spend a fortune on the plushest, fluffiest flannels. "Any will do. "But go for white so you get the satisfaction of seeing the muck come off,” Caroline added. Face flannels can be found for as little as £1 on Amazon. The face cloths can be purchased in most linen departments, and they are sometimes sold as part of a set of towels. After use, the washcloth should be rinsed and hung up to dry. But how often should you wash your face flannel? Face flannels should be washed after three uses maximum. Anna Utley, general manager of the consumer products group at Whirlpool Corporation, explained: "You should wash your towels after no more than three uses. "It's important to wash them frequently. "Not only do they have close contact with your face, but they can also absorb water or sweat and become breeding grounds for bacteria."
