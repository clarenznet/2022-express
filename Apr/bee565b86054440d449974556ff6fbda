It’s been eight years since the third Expendables movie was released and now Sylvester Stallone is gearing up for a fourth outing. The franchise about a group of elite mercenaries played by Hollywood action stars has attracted the likes of Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford, Chuck Norris and Mel Gibson over the years and now the first look at The Expendables 4 has landed. Very little is known about The Expendables 4, which is still set to get a 2022 release date. Nevertheless, more information looks imminent as those attending CinemaCon in Las Vegas this week spotted the first poster. Teased as “EXPEND4BLES”, the shot shows Stallone and the main cast ready for action with an explosion behind them. A huge tagline above the 11 action stars teases: “They’ll die when they’re dead.” DON'T MISSRocky v Rambo - Sylvester Stallone reveals who would win in a fight [STALLONE]Sylvester Stallone left crying after being selling dog for Rocky [ROCKY]Dolph Lundgren finally answers accusation he put Stallone in hospital [DOLPH LUNDGREN] Joining Stallone in The Expendables 4 cast are Jason Statham, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, Megan Fox, Dolph Lundgren, Tony Jaa, Iko Uwais, Randy Couture, Jacob Scipio, Levy Tran and Andy Garcia. It’s unknown at this stage if stars who have appeared in previous outings like Schwarzenegger and Wesley Snipes will make a cameo appearance. Given the poster is at CinemaCon, we’d guess a trailer and release date will be announced at the convention later this week. EXPEN4BLES hits cinemas in 2022.
