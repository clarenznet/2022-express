Alison Hammond, 47, appeared in great spirits as she soaked up the sun during her exotic trip to Dubai. The This Morning star went for a dip in the swimming pool while enjoying the stunning views from her hotel’s rooftop earlier this week. She looked radiant in a selfie shared with her 1.1 million Instagram followers. In the snap, Alison could be seen wearing a leopard print swimsuit which matched her Gucci earrings to perfection. In a separate video shared yesterday, Alison could be seen visiting different landmarks of the skyscraper-filled city. She paired her colourful beach coverup with some sandals and finished off the look with a pair of sunglasses. In the caption, Alison declared: “Feeling the vibes at @driftbeachdubai !!” Fans soon rushed to the post’s comments section to heap praise on the beaming presenter.
