At the end of last month the Duke of York, 62, made headlines after accompanying the monarch to a memorial service for the late Prince Philip, who died last April. The occasion marked Prince Andrew’s first public appearance since reaching a settlement in his sexual abuse civil case with accuser Virginia Giuffre. The settlement is not an admission of guilt and Andrew vehemently denies the claims. Andrew’s willingness to place himself in the public eye at such a high-profile royal event caused further speculation over a possible comeback into the spotlight for the Duke, as sources claim the royal still harbours ambitions of a public role. One source told The Times: “In the past, he has done a lot of good things for charities, also in his capacity as UK trade ambassador. “If he is rehabilitated, then I think he can do a lot of good. The settlement had no admission of guilt.” While another added: “There are rightfully some questions of him but there is rarely a balanced judgment of him in the media. He has a lot to give to people who will let him give.” One more said: “His ambition to return to public life and his belief that he can be of service remains undimmed. But he is the only one who sees it that way.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
