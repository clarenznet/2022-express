Penny Lancaster, 51, put on a show stopping display while out on the town with her rocker husband Sir Rod Stewart, 77.  The blonde beauty stepped out in a silky animal print-inspired green split dress.  Meanwhile, Rod opted for white trousers, which he paired with an open-necked pale shirt and a blue and red striped blazer.  Sir Rod accessorised with a pair of white canvas high top trainers, while Penny showed off her supermodel credentials in high-heeled strappy sandals.  Penny couldn’t resist flaunting her enviably long legs, as she broke into a can-can behind her other half.  The Loose Women panellist cheekily poked her tongue out while flashing her slender pins in the risqué pose.  In a second picture, Sir Rod and Penny put on a loved up display, with the former model wrapping her arms around the Hot Legs hitmaker’s shoulders, as he grinned with glee.  The couple were all smiles before heading into Chinese restaurant Mr Chow, in London’s Knightsbridge.
