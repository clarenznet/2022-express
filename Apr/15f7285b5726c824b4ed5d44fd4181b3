Britons who are struggling to make ends meet due to the cost of living crisis are being reminded to conduct a benefits check. Approximately £15billion is lost in unclaimed benefits every year, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Thousands of people are still missing out on state benefits including disability benefits such as PIP. PIP replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in 2013 and is paid to people between 16 and state pension age who have difficulty completing everyday tasks or moving around. How much someone receives depends on how their condition affects them. It is paid in two parts: a daily living component and a mobility part.

How much they receive will depend on their answers to certain questions about how difficult they find it to complete everyday tasks. Income and savings don’t affect someone’s eligibility as it’s not a means tested benefit.
