On Thursday night, the European Parliament voted in favour of approving an EU rule change to ensure medicines can travel into Northern Ireland from Britain despite post-Brexit red tape. Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, tweeted that there was "great news" from the European Parliament. He said there was an "overwhelmingly positive vote to ensure the continued supply of medicines to Northern Ireland" and that the EU delivered on this in "record time." But many have hit back at the news. The Bruges Group think tank said: "Are we supposed to be grateful? Let’s just get rid of the border in the Irish Sea instead." While Baroness Hoey of Lylehill and Rathlin Kate Hoey also agreed, she said: "Are we meant to be grateful to the EU for telling us we will be allowed to bring medicines from one part of the UK to another?" Under the Northern Ireland protocol, the North was a part of the EU regulatory market for medicines, creating obstacles to free movement. Tory candidate Aaron Rankin called the move "A classic of the genre, patting yourself on the back for doing something utterly meaningless." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
