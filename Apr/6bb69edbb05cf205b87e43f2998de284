England could face Scotland or Wales at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being drawn into Group B. The Three Lions’ road to success in the winter has become clearer following Friday’s draw.      Gareth Southgate’s side face a relatively favourable group from which they should qualify for the knockout rounds. A home nations clash or a meeting with the USA will likely be their toughest game. England are in Group alongside the USA, Iran and the winner of the final European play-off. Wales have already reached the play-off final while Scotland face a rescheduled semi-final against Ukraine. The winner will go into England’s World Cup group. Elsewhere, Spain will face Germany in Group E in the most exciting of the group fixtures. Both are recent World Cup winners, with Spain winning in 2010 and Germany in 2014. See the draw in full below alongside how Express Sport covered the draw.
