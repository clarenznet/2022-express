Scientists from Vienna have found a drug used to treat childhood leukaemia may be used to treat two types of bladder cancer. The study, published in the European Urology journal, found clofarabine was particularly effective. Author of the study, Iris Ertle said: “We found that clofarabine induced complete remission in mice with conventional urothelial carcinoma, while in the animals with sarcomatoid carcinomas it led to massive, sustained shrinkage of the tumours without causing any apparent side effects.” The next step of the study is to conduct trials in humans; should these be successful it could help to save lives.

These include:• Blood in the urine• A need to urinate on a more frequent basis• Sudden urges to urinate• A burning sensation when peeing. If the caner has spread additional symptoms such as pelvic and bone pain, unintentional weight loss, and swelling of the legs can occur.     Cancer Research UK say just under half of bladder cancer cases are preventable. The NHS says the cancer is “often linked with exposure to certain chemicals”. Several factors such as smoking and exposure to some chemicals are risk factors for bladder cancer. Other risk factors include radiotherapy, previous treatment with chemotherapy medications, type two diabetes treatments, UTIs, long-term bladder stones and an untreated infection known as bilharzia are also risk factors. Meanwhile, new studies have revealed the impact of vegetables and red meat on an individual’s likelihood of developing cancer. Researchers found a high consumption of lettuce and legumes reduced the risk of liver cancer and liver disease. In contrast they found processed meats increased the risk of stomach cancer. Epidemiologist Paolo Boffetta said the study reinforces “the idea that avoidance of red meat and processed meat is probably good”.
