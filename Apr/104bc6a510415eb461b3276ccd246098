Those who draw their excess savings as income may face an immediate 25 percent tax charge. This would be charged on top of any income tax someone pays on the pension when they draw it as income. People’s pensions can be tested for the LTA at different points. This includes when: There are usually no additional checks of the LTA after someone reaches age 75.
