BBC Weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood has predicted blustery showers in the South East. Brits are expecting to see temperatures ranging from 17C across parts of the UK. Ms Kirkwood also explained that the North of England and Northern Ireland can expect to see outbreaks of sunshine along with strong gusty winds of up to 25mph. The Met Office has issued no weather warnings across the country today. Ms Kirkwood said: "Now the reason for that is low pressures driving our weather. "It's been pushing in a lot of clouds as we have gone through the course of the night. "That cloud is thick enough for some patchy light rain and also some drizzle. "And as we go through the morning this band of showery rain will continue to push in across the South West.
