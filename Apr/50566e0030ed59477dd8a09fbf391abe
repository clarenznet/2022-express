Stewart Cink has recorded the first hole-in-one of the 2022 Masters thanks to a remarkable tee shot at the iconic par-three 16th at Augusta National. Cink pitched the ball pin-high to the right, before the ball perfectly made its way down the break and dropped into the hole. Cink - like many in the field - had endured a difficult second round in tricky conditions, as the Georgia wind blew around the iconic course. As a result, the American headed to the 16 eight-under par for the tournament and four-over the day. quickly changed though following his heroics on the iconic par three. Following the tee shot, Cink followed his ball towards the green as he took off from the tee box alongside his caddie - and son Reagan. The former Open champion then clearly realised his ball was tracking towards the pin and halted, before jumping into the air in celebration. Meanwhile his son - who was walking a few paces ahead of the American - dropped his dad's bag in amazement before running over and jumping into his arms, as the pair shared a heart-warming embrace. The roar from the crowd was no doubt heard across the famous Augusta National setup, with a number of the patrons watching in the crowd mirroring Cink's reaction by jumping into the air in celebration. Cink is a stalwart on the PGA Tour after making his debut on the circuit, and is no doubt one of the most experienced players competing this week. Throughout his 25-year Tour career, the American has enjoyed plenty of success whilst competing with 15 professional wins to his name. His most iconic no doubt came in 2009 when he was crowned champion golfer of the year, after winning the Open Championship at Turnberry. Cink has not enjoyed such success at Augusta but still bodes an impressive Masters record, having finished in a tie for third one year prior to his major success at the 2008 event in Georgia. Elsewhere Cink has also enjoyed best finishes of third at both the PGA Championship and US Open.
