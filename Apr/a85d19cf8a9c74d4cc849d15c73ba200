Liz Truss praised the tie-up with one of the world’s fast-growing economies as a “win-win” move. She said: “I am proud to launch our new UK-Indonesia roadmap, which will turbocharge our co-operation like never before. “This is fundamentally a win-win. It means delivering jobs and opportunities for the British people in the ­industries of the future across our country, like electric cars and green technology.” Ms Truss said the agreement would boost security and defence relations with Indonesia. This will include a new defence co-operation plan and joint training, while jungle warfare exercises with the British Army are also in the pipeline. The move will also strengthen counterterrorism and cyber security between the UK and Indonesia. The agreement, personally signed off by the Foreign Secretary, will also support a free and open Indo-Pacific. It will enhance collaboration on ­investment in sustainable infrastructure projects and industries. The agreement will mean closer ties with the Indonesian economy, which is forecast to more than quintuple in GDP, with 532 per cent growth predicted between 2020 and 2050. Indonesia is one of the world’s most populated countries and is forecast to have the world’s fourth largest economy by 2050. Ties will also be boosted by the UK’s offer of more than £4billion to finance long-term projects, and by the relaunched British International Investment scheme entering the south-east Asian market later this year.
