   Laura, who is best known for playing Lady Edith Crawley in ITVâ€™s hit historical drama Downton Abbey, stunned on the red carpet for the premiere of her latest film. The actress wore a baby pink mini dress made of a gorgeous, floaty material, which highlighted her toned legs. The garment featured a long train that billowed gracefully behind her as she walked. The front of the dress was asymmetrical and had a diagonal neckline with only one sleeve.  On her feet, the actress wore a matching pair of light pink stilettos with a pointed toe. Laura opted for a subtle makeup look, wearing a shiny pink lip gloss and mascara on her upper and lower lashes. She accessorised with some drop-down pearl earrings, one of which was visible behind her hair, which she had tucked behind one ear. The star wore her above-shoulder-length tresses in a relaxed, wavy style that complimented the garment well.
