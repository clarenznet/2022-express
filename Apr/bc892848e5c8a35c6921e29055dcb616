Fern Britton, 64, was pictured strolling around Manchester looking downcast on her shopping trip yesterday. The former This Morning presenter was wearing a black knitted jumper and black trousers teamed with black and white trainers. Fern styled her outfit with a brown bag, a pink watch and dark shades which covered her face. The presenter wore her dark blonde tresses in an updo, as she strolled around the city centre. This comes after Fern recently opened up in a new interview about her split from ex-husband Phil Vickery. As one of TV's golden couples, Phil and Fern caused shockwaves when they announced they were going their separate ways in January 2020. The star candidly revealed that she's becoming more confident with age. The ITV star said: "When you get to 40, you think, ‘I’m not going to take any more s*** from anybody.’ "When you get to 50, you start saying ‘F***off!’ to everybody. "When you’re 60, you think, ‘Do you know what? I can’t be a****. I’m allowed to say it," she added. The pair tied the knot in 2000 before they welcomed their daughter Winnie, who was born in 2001. Addressing her recovery from the break-up, Fern admitted that it was "difficult". She said: "People say that they bounce back from a long relationship, but it takes a while. The rebound is difficult. "You chuck the pebble in the pond but the ripples go on for a very long time," she explained to Woman & Home magazine.
