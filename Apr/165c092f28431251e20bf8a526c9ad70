The retro gaming market continues to produce collectibles that have surged in value, with some classic PlayStation, Nintendo and SEGA gems experiencing a price rise recently. This news comes courtesy of PriceCharting, a website that tracks the value of countless retro games and consoles. This crucial information helps make sure collectors don't pay over the odds for something they're looking to add to their gaming room, and also means people selling retro PlayStation, Nintendo, SEGA and Xbox games or consoles get a fair price. Besides providing up to date pricing information on an endless amount of collectibles, PriceCharting also has a section on its site which shows the biggest movers and shakers. And one collectible on the PriceCharting 'hot' items list is worth thousands of pounds. This is the PlayStation 10 Million Edition console, which is a rare console that Sony gave away to celebrate selling 10million units of its debut system. Only 100 of these were ever produced. PriceCharting says a loose version of this recently rose in value by £77 to £3,871.92. However, if you have a complete version (i.e comes with box, manual, and inserts) then it's worth £6,713. And if you have a brand new version it's worth a whopping £17,455. Despite having an eye-watering price tag which reflects its rarity, the PlayStation 10 Million Edition console isn't the retro gaming collectible which has risen in value the most recently.
