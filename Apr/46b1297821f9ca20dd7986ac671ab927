Paulina Gretzky, 33, has waited nine long years to tie the knot with her golfer beau Dustin Johnson, 37, so it came as no surprise that they went all out for their big day. It was described by one lucky guest as the “Met Gala of weddings” as the couple spared no expense on their special day. The model and Dustin said their 'I do's' at the luxury hotel and resort Blackberry Farm in Tennessee on Saturday. The pair exchanged vows in front of a glamorous crowd of friends and family, including the bride's hockey legend father, Wayne Gretzky. Dustin and Paulina's big day was attended by their most glamorous friends, including reality stars Paige DeSorbo and Craig Conover, of Bravo's Summer House fame, as well as Southern Charm star Austen Kroll. On Monday, the new Mrs Dustin Johnson posted photos from the couple’s extravagant nuptials. Captioning the Instagram post with their wedding date, “4/23/22,” Paulina can be seen wearing a sheer Vera Wang gown in the first photo as she kisses Johnson, who wore a black tux. In the second photo, the bride models a white Vera Wang dress with an open back as the 2020 Masters champ rocks a grey suit. Friends of the couple also shared photos of Paulina's other outfits for the occasion on Instagram, which included a plunging white satin evening gown that showed off her enviable assets.
