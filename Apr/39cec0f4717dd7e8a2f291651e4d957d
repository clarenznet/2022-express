Musk said: "Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it." It recently emerged that Musk was Twitter's biggest shareholder after he built up a stake in the firm.  He said that his offer for the company is final, and threatened to dump his stake if the takeover bid is rejected. South African-born Musk, 50, said: "I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. "However, since making my investment I now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.  "Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company." Twitter has yet to respond to Musk's bid. Earlier this month, it had offered him a seat on its board, which would have barred him from making his bid. Musk declined and Twitter boss Parag Agrawal said it was "for the best".
