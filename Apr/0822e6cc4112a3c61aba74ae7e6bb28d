  Demi, 27, posted the video this afternoon to her 19.3 million Instagram followers with the caption: “Barbie mode.” The star pouted her lips while the camera zoomed in and out to show off her new look as she sat on a wooden chair. The outfit featured a cotton candy pink cardigan with cap sleeves and a white collar. It was fastened over her bust with a small metal chain that seemed to barely contain her large bosom.  She paired the cardigan with some blue jeans, which were ripped at the thigh. Demi accessorised with a white string belt, which she looped through the jeans. She wore her hair in two long bunches on either side of her head, which came all the way down to her legs. Demi finished off the look with some pink eyeshadow, lip gloss and some false eyelashes.
