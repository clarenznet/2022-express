Amazon is in the middle of its Spring Sale, which offers a wide range of discounts across the most popular departments, including its own devices. And one incredibly popular product that has enjoyed a price cut in the Spring Sale is the third-generation Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker. This usually costs £39.99, but is currently available for just £21.99 – however, it is possible to get it even cheaper. If you purchase two Echo Dots today, you can drop the price of both smart speakers even further. If you add a pair of third-generation Echo Dot smart speakers into your basket and use the code ECHODOT3 at checkout, Amazon will drop the sale price by an extra £6. With the discount code applied, the cost of your shopping basket will drop from £43.98 to £37.98, which effectively makes each Echo Dot just £18.99. That's an incredible price for this smart home kit. In fact, it's the cheapest price available on the Echo Dot right now, and the cheapest that the speaker has been available for some time. For those who don't know, Amazon Echo Dot is powered by chatty voice assistant Alexa, who is capable of managing your calendars, setting timers and reminders, reading out the latest forecast and headlines, playing music, podcasts and radio stations, and more. This deal isn't the only money-saving offer that Amazon is running at the moment, with the newer, fourth-generation Echo Dot also getting a hefty price cut. The latest version of Amazon's iconic Alexa speaker, which this time around sports an eye-catching ball-shaped design instead of a disc one, is usually priced at £49.99. But in the Amazon Spring sale it's available for half-price at £24.99.  Besides the Echo Dot speakers, Amazon has also cut the price of other Alexa devices like the Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube, Fire tablets and Kindle eReaders. Among the best deals available right now are discounts on the Fire TV Stick which brings the price down from £39.99 to £22.99 and an eye-catching deal which slashes £30 off the price of a Kindle ereader.
