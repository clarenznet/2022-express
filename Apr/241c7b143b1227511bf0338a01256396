A study of 200 osteoarthritis patients found those who had the jabs over six months had less pain. They also had greater movement and functional benefits, a team at Keele University, Staffs, said.  Steroids can be injected directly into a joint to reduce pain and swelling, but access to treatment is patchy, according to the study's lead author, Dr Zoe Paskins. She said: "Currently, some people can access steroid injections, but it is subject to local variation and a 'postcode lottery'." The findings were published in The British Medical Journal.
