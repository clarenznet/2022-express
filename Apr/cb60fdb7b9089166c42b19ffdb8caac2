His heyday was in 1963 when he rode 71 winners, including a victory on Only For Life in the 2,000 Guineas, an English classic. However not every ride went according to the plan. In 1957 at Sandown his horse Aggressor jumped into the bandstand. "The music stopped and the conductor demanded an explanation as to what I was doing there," he said at the time. "Then whoosh? the horse jumped out, over the rockery." Born in Wembley, Middlesex, his father Fred owned a garage and restaurant. The family moved to Eastbourne, where their home was destroyed during a Second World War bombing raid. He was stuck in the rubble for eight hours but survived. He had a further narrow escape when staying with his grandmother in Kent. A bomb landed in the garden but he escaped injury.
