At least 97 percent of houses in the UK breach at least one World Health Organisation limit for harmful air. Nearly three in four addresses - 21.5 million - exceed the WHO's limits of three filthy pollutants, namely PM2.5, PM10 and nitrogen dioxide. Ella Kissi-Debrah, nine, became the first person with air pollution listed as a cause of death when she died in 2013 after suffering a severe asthma attack caused by airborne toxins. The family home was near the South Circular road in southeast London.  Professor Sir Stephen Holgate, advisor to the Royal College of Physicians, said: "Air pollution is an invisible killer and because you can't see it it's easy for people to forget. It's essential that the public are given air pollution data for where they are thinking of buying or renting. In many cases, like that of little Ella, it can be a matter of life or death." The culprits affecting air quality include particles released by cars, factories or burning wood. The Central Office of Public Interest (COPI) and Imperial College London mapped pollution levels recorded at 20,000 monitoring sites. Buckingham Palace falls into the 98th national percentile with some of the highest levels in the UK, while Balmoral Castle is in the lowest. Gardens in Kent, Bath, East Anglia and some coastal towns have some of the UK's worst pollution levels.
