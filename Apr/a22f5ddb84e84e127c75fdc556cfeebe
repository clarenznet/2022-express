Mick Schumacher has been backed to return to his best by Haas team principal Gunther Steiner after the German suffered a horrific high-speed crash in qualifying for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix last Saturday.  The star, 23, withdrew from the main race on the Sunday after his car was thrown off balance on turn 10 in Jeddah. He slammed into the wall at high-speed, and was originally knocked out from the impact. After regaining consciousness, the Swiss-born star was airlifted to hospital for further checks and scans. The crash cost Haas an estimated Â£700,000, and there were doubts over whether his mentality would still be intact. But Steiner has backed Schumacher to get back to his very best ahead of the Australian Grand Prix next week. "I don't think that he'll lose confidence," Steiner said. "I think just getting back in a car, then you gain this confidence again. We need to talk [the accident] through, but I think he needs to do that because we didn't drive the car. We need to know what he wants to see. "[We still have to] compare the data with Kevin [Magnussen], and I haven't compared the data. Did he try too hard? Was the tyre not warm enough? We need to find out." Schumacher, son of racing legend Michael, embarked on his first season for Haas last season although he failed to finish higher than 12th. He bettered that in the first race of the campaign with an 11th-placed finish on the opening day in Bahrain.  And the 23-year-old will look to pick up his first point in the Australian Grand Prix on April 10. Valtteri Bottas won the 2019 version of the race in Melbourne whilst driving for Mercedes. And the Fin could aim to grab his first win for Alfa Romeo after moving in the winter.
