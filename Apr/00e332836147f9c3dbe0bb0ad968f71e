Max Verstappen will start tomorrow's Emilia Romagna Grand Prix from pole position after overtaking Charles Leclerc at the end of a thrilling sprint event on Saturday. The Dutchman managed to pick up eight championship points and put himself in the best position to win his second Grand Prix of the new season at the expense of Leclerc, who led for the vast majority of the contest but was ultimately pipped by his Red Bull rival with only a few laps remaining. Leclerc executed a near-perfect start to nip ahead of Verstappen off the line before holding his advantage until the closing stages of the 21-lap event. The Dutchman eventually managed to force his way into the lead with just two laps remaining to secure the best possible starting berth for tomorrow's race at Imola. Meanwhile, it was another disastrous afternoon for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes, who were miles off the pace once again over the course of the session. The seven-time Drivers' Championship winner will have been left frustrated with his efforts after crossing the line in 14th place, while George Russell was only able to register a 12th-placed finish.
