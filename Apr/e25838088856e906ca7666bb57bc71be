James Douglas, 28, was killed after a pillar collapsed on top of him as he climbed onto the hanging seat, which was elevated between two brick columns. The property developer had returned to his family home in Tunstall Village Green in Sunderland after work at around tea time on Good Friday. Emergency services raced to the address at 5.30pm after the garden pillar, which had been standing for 15 years, collapsed on top of James, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Devastated mum Lynne Wright today paid tribute to her “incredible” son following the tragedy. She said: “We are all absolutely devastated, completely heartbroken – James had the world at his feet, he was incredible. "He had everything and he worked so hard, everything he touched turned to gold, he was such a lovely person and was loved by so many people.” James - who also managed a letting company, funeral business and party event firm along with brother and best friend Grant, 24 – had planned to take a quick nap before heading out to the stables later in the afternoon where he and his girlfriend of 10 years, Lauren, kept horses. Lynne, 50 added: “It was like any normal day so it has come as a huge shock to everyone. All James did was work and he was brilliant at everything he did, but his life has been tragically cut short – We are so distraught.” A report is now being prepared for the coroner so an inquest into the circumstances of James’ death can be held. Lynne added: “You don’t expect things like this to happen to your family and we don’t know how or why the pillar fell down because it’s been standing for so long. "James will be truly missed by so many people – he was exceptionally hard working and one of a kind.”
