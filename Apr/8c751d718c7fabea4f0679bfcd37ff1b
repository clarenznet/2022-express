Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge welcomed their third child, Prince Louis of Cambridge, on April 23, 2018, at St Mary's Hospital in London. Louis lives with his parents and siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte in Kensington Palace and Anmer Hall in Norfolk, and he started his education at Wilcocks Nursery School in the capital. Louis has often made royal fans giggle with his hilarious facial expressions at royal events, and he's expected to make another appearance this year on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour 2022.
