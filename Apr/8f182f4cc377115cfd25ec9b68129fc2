Dyson definitely offers some of the best vacuums on the market with its latest V15 Detect even coming packed with a laser that reveals where every speck of dirt is hiding on your floors. However, with some of these dust-busters costing over £500 owning a Dyson isn't exactly cheap. Luckily, if you were thinking of having a mega spring clean over the weekend there is a much cheaper way to own a cordless vacuum thanks to a huge sale on popular Shark cleaners. The big discounts which are available from stores including John Lewis, Currys and Amazon, mean prices now start from just £199 which is a saving of almost 50 percent off the usual cost. Vacuums on sale include the SHARK Anti Hair Wrap IZ201UK, SHARK Anti Hair Wrap & PowerFins IZ300UK and the more premium SHARK Anti Hair Wrap with PowerFins & Pet Tool IZ320UKT which even includes two power packs for extended usage. All of these cleaners feature impressive battery life, lightweight design that bends to help get under sofas and anti-tangle technology that separates and removes all long, short and pet hair from the bristle brush-roll as you clean. There's also a clever system that traps dust and allergens inside the vacuum, so they're not released back into the air you breathe.
