But his casual threats of using nuclear weapons against those who are supporting Ukraine – a country he has ordered the invasion of – is beyond parody. We have seen the awful atrocities committed by Russian soldiers at the behest of their president already. Bombed out hospitals, schools targeted, mass graves, women raped. This man has unleashed horror in Europe and one day he and his cronies will have to account for what they have done. But in the meantime, we must not be cowed by empty threats over nuclear weapons, an option which would be suicidal for Russia and is beyond even Putin. We’re well rid of EU elite Remember the doom and gloom from all the Remainers after the EU referendum in 2016? Brexit will mean we have no medicines, will lose our jobs, will have empty shelves and Britain will be a minor country. It has all turned out to be rubbish. Countries are lining up to do trade deals, the UK led the way on vaccines and Ukraine and we are at the heart of world affairs. In fact it is the EU which is constantly following our lead now as the Ukraine crisis has underlined. No wonder Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, confidently remarked that leaving the EU has been remarkably smooth. It is, though, disturbing that the EU, as he points out, is trying to use the risk of the collapse of peace in Northern Ireland as leverage. As each day passes it becomes clearer that the people of Britain made the right the decision in 2016 and we are well rid of the Brussels elite. --------------------------- World-beating ingenuity Parkinson's is a disease that causes misery and ultimately death for those unfortunate to suffer from it. So it is very good news that surgeons at Southmead Hospital in Bristol have found a way of reversing the symptoms of this awful condition. It is again a sign of the leading medical research we have in this country and the depth of expertise and ingenuity we have here. ------------------------------
