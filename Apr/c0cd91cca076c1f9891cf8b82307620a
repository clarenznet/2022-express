Demi Rose, 26, stunned fans as she took to Instagram to share short videos of her outfit for the first day of Coachella. The model shared the videos in view of her 19.3 million Instagram followers. The first video showed off the model's figure as she sported a one-piece cut out pink swimsuit. Demi's eye-popping assets were held together by a clip, while her toned midriff was exposed. Covering her legs, she wore a figure-hugging white crochet sarong. The front featured dark beading and large rips, extenuating the model's figure. In another video, Demi can be seen walking away from the camera showing off her perky rear and luscious brunette tresses. Her hair featured two small plaits at the front that fell into a beach wave. Including a picture of the festival she captioned the post: "First Coachella."
