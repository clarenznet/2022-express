Tom Parker’s wife Kelsey Parker was seen holding back tears as she joined the funeral procession for her late husband. Kelsey, 30, shares two children with the late star: a daughter named Aurelia, two, and one-year-old son Bodhi.      Tom’s loved ones gathered to say goodbye to The Wanted star today in Petts Wood, London. His wife Kelsey had welcomed fans to join on his final journey to the church, sharing the address for mourners to attend from 10am. The singer’s widow could be seen clasping the hands of her loved ones for support as she made her way through the streets. She wore a black garment with a dark brown blazer that sparkled in the sun as she made the difficult journey.        Kelsey wore shades on her eyes along with other family members as they walked in solidarity. Screens were outside so fans could also watch the emotional ceremony. As the hearse travelled along the roads, floral displays spelling out “Tom” and The Wanted’s song “Glad You Came” were also spotted. Kelsey said in an earlier statement: "Thomas Anthony Parker. There will be a private celebration of life on Wednesday 20th April.      “We know many of you would like to pay your respects as well, so would love for you to join us in Petts Wood from 10am. “It would be beautiful to have everyone line the route as we head to our private service. “You are then welcome to join us outside the church for the duration where the service will be relayed on screens."

The diagnosis came after he suffered a seizure and was put on a waiting list for an MRI scan. After being rushed to hospital following a much worse seizure, doctors told him the sad news that he was facing “the worst case scenario”.      Despite having terminal cancer, Tom was praised by fans and colleagues for his positive attitude and incredible charm. The star even made the brave decision to get up on stage with The Wanted while they were on tour, just months before his death. His bandmates Max George, Jay McGuinness, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes looked solemn as they attended the ceremony today. When Tom’s wife Kelsey announced the news of his death late last month, she wrote: “Our hearts are broken.”
