Cristiano Ronaldo has taken to Instagram and shared a heartwarming family photo alongside his partner Georgina Rodriguez, just days after announcing the tragic loss of his son. The 37-year-old revealed in October that the couple were expecting twins but announced this week that their newborn son had died during childbirth, while their daughter survived. The Manchester United striker shared a social media update shortly after their baby girl made the journey back from hospital following her birth on Monday. Taking to Instagram, the professional footballer posted a sweet photo in view of his 430 million followers. Ronaldo cradled his daughter while accompanied by Spanish partner Georgina and their four children - three of which the footballer fathered through surrogates. He shares daughter Alana, three, with his long-term girlfriend and he also has son Cristiano Jr., 11, and twins Eva and Mateo, four. He captioned the Instagram post: "Home sweet home. Gio and our baby girl are finally together with us. We want to thank everyone for all the kind words and gestures. "Your support is very important and we all felt the love and respect that you have for our family. Now it’s time to be grateful for the life that we’ve just welcomed into this world." A statement released on Monday confirmed one of the couple's twins had died, with Ronaldo describing the loss as "the greatest pain".
