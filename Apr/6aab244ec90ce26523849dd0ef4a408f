The price cap alteration allows energy companies to add a further 54 percent to most people's bills and follows a year of trouble in the sector. More than 20 companies folded under unprecedented pressure in 2021, and ministers have allowed those remaining to relieve the burden by boosting their prices by an additional £700 a year. With up to 22 million homes expected to feel the burn, people will want to curb costs. Poorer households may have to choose between food and heating this year, experts have warned, as prices become insurmountable. People don't have to just grit and bear through it all, however, as there are methods available to cut down on those prices. Heating will arise as a primary concern, as there is more than one way to heat a home.

Naturally, this can prove expensive as it uses gas over a wide area for several hours a day. The alternative is for people to heat only the rooms they need with an electric appliance that works independently. Units take their power from wall sockets rather than one central system, but this isn't necessarily cheaper upfront. Gas central heating systems require the hand of a specially trained tradesperson and cost up to £5,250 on average. Electric central heating systems cost markedly less, averaging out at £3,790. Heaters not hardwired to the mains usually require a single plug socket, with no electrician necessary. There are other factors to consider when weighing whether or not they want electric heating. The next thing to consider is efficiency, as gas won't convert to heat at a 1:1 rate. Most research shows that, at peak efficiency, gas boilers are roughly 90 percent effective. Electric heaters generate one unit of heat per hour of operation. In the long run, electricity can give people more bang for their buck.
