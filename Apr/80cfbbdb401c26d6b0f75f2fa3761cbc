Amanda Holden, 51, looked sensational as she shared photos on Instagram, where she stunned while wearing a pink check jacket, teamed with a matching skirt, featuring a raunchy thigh-high split. The Britain's Got Talent judge made temperatures rise inside Global FM towers today while striking a sultry pose for her 1.8million followers. The mum-of-two shared a Boomerang that saw her cheekily cross her legs to protect her modesty from being exposed in the daring skirt. Amanda wore her hair in loose waves paired with bronzed makeup to complete the Barbie doll themed outfit. On her feet were baby pink court-style stilettos that complemented her famously toned legs. The star simply captioned the clip: “#onwednesdayswewearpink,” in reference to Lindsay Lohan’s smash hit movie Mean Girls. Also sharing the video to her story, Amanda tagged Fashion Unique as the brand that had designed the fashionable co-ord. She then posted a still image of her wearing the outfit, while showing off her expertly painted red nail polish as she leaned down to touch her foot. In response to the photo, fans said Amanda in pink “was everything” as they raved over the spring ensemble.
