A US Air Force Bell/Boeing CV-22B Osprey, call sign XXXX and registered AE4ECE, has been noticed flying over the south of England. According to flight trackers, the Osprey has flown a handful of times over the course of the afternoon and evening. Twitter account DTY VirtualRadar, a bot which tweets the location of aircraft flying over the UK, flagged at 9:06pm the Osprey was over Alconbury. According to flight tracking website adsbexchange.com, the Osprey made four journeys throughout Wednesday. The US aircraft flew from RAF Mildenhall southwest to the Salisbury Plain Training Area, where it made a landing, at around 6:27pm. At 7:05pm, the Osprey then flew from Imber Range to RAF Brize Norton outside Carterton. At 8:16pm, the Osprey reached an altitude over 10,000ft and flew to the Stanford Training Area. The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is a tilt rotor aircraft, designed by the US in the 1980s following the failure of Operation Eagle Claw. Eagle Claw was an attempt to rescue 52 embassy staff held captive at the Iranian Embassy of the United States, Tehran on April 24, 1980. The V-22 first flew in 1989 and began flight testing and design alterations, before first being fielded in 2007. Earlier in April, it was reported production of the V-22 Osprey is beginning to cease. V-22 can cruise at over 300 miles per hour to an unrefueled range of a thousand miles. It comes after a soldier was killed after a Navy V-22 crashed off the Virginia coast in March. The V-22 Osprey aircraft crashed north of the Chincoteague Causeway just off Wildcat Point near the Maryland line shortly after 7:30pm. Lt. Cmdr. Rob Myers, a public affairs officer with Naval Air Force Atlantic, said the plane was on a routine exercise when it went down. When emergency dispatchers made contact, they found two injured crewmembers on top of the aircraft with injuries. The two had reportedly suffered broken legs.
