Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle stopped off at Windsor on their way to The Hague, in the Netherlands, for the Invictus Games. The visit is thought to be Harry’s first to Britain since last July, while the Duchess of Sussex was last reported to be in the country during March 2020. Last month, Harry’s absence was noted from a memorial service for his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, in London.  His visit comes as he’s bringing a court challenge against the Government's decision to deny police security during his visits from the US. Harry has offered to pay for the protection himself and has argued that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information that is needed to keep his family safe. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex lost their publicly funded police protection in the UK when they stepped down as senior working royals and moved to the US two years ago. So, do you think Harry really needs security when he makes return trips to Britain? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
