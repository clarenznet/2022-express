Amal Clooney, 44, set pulses racing last night in a lovely red sheer dress. The human rights attorney's petite waist was on show as the dress cuddled her trim figure. The bottom of Amal's dress featured detailed embroidery and ruched fabric across her hips. The look was complete with two bows at the back, adding more elegance to the dress. She partnered the outfit with a pair of silver stiletto heels and a rectangle boxy clutch. George Clooney's wife wore her long tresses in waves with the hair falling to one side. She matched her elegant outfit with subtle makeup and a red lip, perfectly matching her dress. Amal's mother, Baria, wore a white ensemble, adding a bright yellow jacket. She's been spending some quality time with her mother in New York City in recent days. Amal was pictured with her mother stepping out of the Whitby Hotel in Midtown Manhattan to head to dinner. The pair are relaxing after Amal's address to the United Nations the day before. During the tense session, Amal accused the UN of ignoring potential war crimes perpetrated by Russia amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine during an informal meeting of the Security Council. Missing from all of Amal's recent outings was her husband George, with the couple's most recent joint red carpet appearance occuring in October 2021.
