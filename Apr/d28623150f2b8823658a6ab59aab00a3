Lady Gaga, 36, is known for her legendary songs and impressive acting career in A Star is Born and House of Gucci in recent years. The singer turned actress has made sure not to put her hit-making career on the back burner, as she continues her Las Vegas residency. Lady Gaga stunned as she showed off her outfit on Instagram in the dressing room prior to going on stage. In view of her 52.2 million followers, the singer posted a mirror selfie as the last finishing touches were added to her outfit. She looked amazing with a full face of glistening makeup and a very low-cut black sparkly dress, showing off the star's ample assets. Lady Gaga was supposed to be embarking on her tour two years ago, however, Covid got in the way. Her Las Vegas residency is taking place at MGM's Park Theater, with previous shows including six different stage outfits. The Just Dance singer went on to show off more of the dress on her Instagram story, which featured a plunging neckline and silver jewel detailing on the side, alongside a daring thigh-high split. She completed the stunning outfit with a huge feathered headpiece, black heels and a bright red lip.
