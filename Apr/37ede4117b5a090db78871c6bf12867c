The oil tanker was about 300 kilometres east of Hong Kong when the blast occurred. Two helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft from Home Kong's Flying Service have been dispatched to the scene to help with the emergency. The first helicopter arrived at 19.00 to start the rescue operation.  However, it arrived too late to help one crew member, who died while the helicopter was on its way. Another sailor is reported to have suffered second-degree burns that covered 50 percent of the body. The "Chuang Yi" oil taker is 119 meters long, 16 metres wide and was built back in 2000. It currently sails under the flag of Panama.  Hong Kong has previously experienced oil tanker explosions. In 2019, the Vietnam-registered Aulac Fortune burst into flames as it prepared to fuel. The incident claimed the life of one crew member. Twenty one other sailors were rescued from the sea. Witnesses reported hearing a loud blast that shook windows several miles away.
