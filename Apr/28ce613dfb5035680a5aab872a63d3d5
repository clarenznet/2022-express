Parker, who sang Flying Without Wings by Irish boyband Westlife, later said the experience had left him "shattered". "I didn't sing for two years," he said. "There was a girl who was really terrible at the same audition who got through. It turned out she was one of the people they put in the show to laugh at."  He returned to education for a time, studying geography at Manchester Metropolitan University but dropped out, realising his dream was to pursue a career in music. He toured clubs across northern England as a member of the tribute band Take That II before joining The Wanted in 2009. The group flew to No 1 in the UK charts with their debut single All Time Low, followed by a No.2 hit with their second single, Heart Vacancy. Glad You Came, the first single off their second album, was another UK No.1 and climbed to No.3 in the US charts. When The Wanted announced a hiatus in 2014, he took up DJ-ing and reached the semi-finals of Celebrity MasterChef in 2015. Three years later, he stripped off for ITV's The Real Full Monty: Live to raise funds for male cancers. Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in 2020, he spoke publicly about his health to raise awareness of his condition. Parker married Kelsey Hardwick in 2018. She survives him, along with their young daughter Aurelia and son Bodhi.  Tom Parker born August 4, 1988, died March 30, 2022, aged 33
