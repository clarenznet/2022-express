Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and Nicola Peltz, 27, exchanged their vows on Saturday in front of celebrity guests including the budding chef's proud mum and dad Victoria and David Beckham. A number of high-profile names attended the lavish ceremony in Palm Beach including the fashion designer's former Spice Girl bandmates Melanie C and Mel B as well as Serena Williams and her sister Venus. They were all spotted at the wedding which was held at Nicola's £76 million family estate in Florida. Taking to Instagram yesterday, Victoria revealed that she had in fact dressed some of her closest celebrity pals and family members for her son's big day, and also created her one-off piece wedding attire which was hand made. In view of her 29.7 million followers, she penned: "Beautiful weekend celebrating @brooklynpeltzbeckham @nicolaannepeltzbeckham. So proud to have dressed some of my favourite ladies and best friends for the occasion." The first snap showed a photo of her friend and actress Eva Longoria who sported a halterneck black dress. The gown, which is priced at £990, has yet to be released, with the Desperate Housewives being one of the first to wear it. She captioned the post:  “Obsessed with my dress from last night." The next slide showed Marc Anthony’s new girlfriend Nadia Ferreira, a Paraguayan model who competed in last year’s Miss Universe pageant, was also one of the lucky ones dressed by designer Victoria and rocked a blue patterned slip dress. Romeo Beckham's girlfriend Mia Regan was another one dressed by the former Spice Girl. Victoria also styled her mother Jackie Adams, and the 71-year-old looked sensational in a custom-made navy blue tailored jumpsuit, complete with a matching cropped blazer
