The Prime Minister will meet the German Chancellor in Downing Street today to discuss sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson is expected to offer Mr Scholz assistance to reduce Germany's dependency on Moscow's energy exports which it has been struggling to do because it receives more than 40 percent of its gas from Russia. The effort comes after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused Germany of being the "main roadblock" to new EU sanctions. Politico also reported that the German Chancellor is delaying a final decision over whether to give Ukraine high-end tanks for its battle against Russia, despite pressure from several other top officials. The delay is due to Mr Scholz believing Germany should first reach a common position with Western allies on the subject before delivering such heavy military equipment, four officials told the publication.
