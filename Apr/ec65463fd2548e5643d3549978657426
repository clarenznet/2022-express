Virgin Media is back with a tasty deal that could be perfect for anyone planning a party. The broadband and TV firm is currently dishing out free wine when customers sign up for a swathe of different bundles with some packages featuring 16 bottles of booze when users sign on the dotted line. The case of plonk is worth up to £223.84 and will arrive at your front door courtesy of Virgin Wines. Anyone who doesn't drink, or would rather have some money added to their account, can also opt for bill credit instead with some bundles including a whopping £100 of cashback to help reduce the monthly bills. These offers are available across a number of plans including Virgin's entry-level Big Bundle and top-end Ultimate Volt Bundle. Along with the free wine or bill credit, there's more good news with Virgin also confirming that these deals are free to join with the usual £35 set-up fee currently scrapped.
