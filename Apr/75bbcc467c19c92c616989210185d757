The lane closures are causing traffic to move slowly from Junction 7 on the M23 to the services where the lorry broke down.  Queues were reported around six miles long of solid traffic. The lorry broke down in lane 3 meaning only lane 4 is open for moving traffic. At around 6.40am, traffic service Inrix reported: "Three lanes closed and queuing traffic due to broken down lorry on M25 anticlockwise at Clacket Lane Services. Congestion to J6 Godstone. Between J6 Godstone and J5 M26. Lanes one, two and three (of four) still closed past a broken down lorry, but the vehicle fire shortly after is clear." Recovery is on the scene but the lanes still remain closed and there is heavy queuing.

Highways England announced that the lanes were reopened and traffic was released just before 8:30am. But traffic still remains slow and queues continue while the congestion clears.
