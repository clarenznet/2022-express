The former EastEnder turned documentary maker is backing a bonus Bank Holiday to honour the Queen’s 70 years of service and the millions working for their communities. And, as we revealed on Tuesday, PM Boris Johnson is now poised to award an extra day off every year. Dad-of-four Ross, 57, said: “We’re still not good enough at recognising those who make a difference. “It would be a brilliant lasting tribute to our Queen if we did this every year with a new Bank Holiday – a Thank Holiday.” Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith, 82, also gave her backing. She said Covid had seen a “wonderful upsurge of generally pulling together”. Prue added: “An annual national day to bring us together, and allow us to think about what matters locally is a really good idea.” Support for an official extra day comes as the nation prepares for a four-day Platinum Jubilee jamboree. On June 5 communities will come together for National Thank You Day to honour the monarch, with 10 million expected to participate. Yesterday Ross joined the Royal Voluntary Service and the Together Coalition in Banbury, Oxon, to launch Cheers for Volunteers on Thank You Day. He called on everyone to raise a glass to them then, adding: “Let’s take the time to thank those who sacrifice so much for the rest of us.”
