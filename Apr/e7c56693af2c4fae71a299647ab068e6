Appearing on Russian statecontrolled TV on Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called weapons supplies to Ukraine a provocation. He argued NATO is essentially at war with Russia, using Ukraine as a proxy. And Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went even further. She suggested there might be legitimate military targets within NATO member states supplying weapons to Ukraine. Various politicians have even said the use of nuclear weapons is not off the table. But Russia's rhetoric famously does not always reflect reality. While it is true that nothing is ever completely "off the table", this sabre-rattling is meant to both impress at home and make NATO members falter. It reflects a deep frustration among Russia's ruling elite that its war isn't going to plan. First, this has not been the simple and successful "special military operation" the Kremlin banked on. Second, when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and and poisoned Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 the response was pretty weak. The level of consolidated global backlash this time round took the Kremlin by surprise: sanctions across Europe and North America, NATO discussions in Finland and Sweden and weapons supplied. Russian politicians have responded to this Western unity by representing Russia as being a "besieged fortress" now under attack from all sides. At home, the Kremlin is working overtime to manufacture support for the war. If the West is the villain, the war must be justified. Russia might be under attack, but it is strong. Co-ordinated support for Ukraine's resistance has undermined Russia's plan for a quick and easy win. But the Kremlin will push for what it can get away with - and what it can sell at home as a "win".
