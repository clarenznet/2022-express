Deborah Lee, chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals Foundation Trust, said she had now recovered but warned that urgent action was needed from the Government. Reflecting on the event, she tweeted: "I can't get one thing out of my head: What if my husband hadn't been there and my daughter called for an ambulance and I'd been put in the Cat 2 'stack'?" In the South West, where Mrs Lee works, the average response time for a category two call, which includes strokes, is one hour 53 minutes - the highest in England. The target for that category of call is 18 minutes. Mrs Lee, who has more than 30 years of experience in the NHS, said her husband had heard her "lamenting" ambulance delays, so chose to drive her to A&E when she displayed symptoms of a stroke, rather than call 999. Ambulance response times in England have risen to their worst levels on record.
