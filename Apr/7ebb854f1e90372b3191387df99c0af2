Some 42 per cent want the Duke of Cambridge to take the throne when the Queen dies and only 24 percent would like the Prince of Wales to succeed. But the findings also reveal 48 percent of people still think Charles will do a good job, against 19 percent who consider he will do a bad job. The Ipsos research, which interviewed 2,055 adults, also found the proportion of people who view Charles favourably has increased since 2018 to 43 percent - up 11 percentage points. Some 36 percent feel the same about the Duchess of Cornwall. People are much more likely to have a good opinion of the Queen, seen favourably by 69 percent, with William close behind on 64 percent and Kate earning a 60 percent rating. Only 30 percent put Prince Harry in a favourable light, down 35 points on four years ago, while just 24 percent think well of Meghan, down 16 points.  Seven in 10 now have an unfavourable opinion of the scandal-hit Duke of York. When it comes to abolishing the monarchy, 44 percent state it would be worse for Britain with only 22 percent claiming it would be better. Gideon Skinner, from Ipsos, said: "With the popularity of Prince William not far behind the Queen, Britons wonder whether Charles should step aside."
