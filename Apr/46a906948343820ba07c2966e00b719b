A man died in the blast at a property Wythenshawe, Manchester, at around 6.30pm yesterday. Emergency services evacuated an entire row of houses, residents of which today reported hearing a "huge" bang which "shook their houses like an earthquake". Speaking to Manchester Evening News, one resident continued: "It’s just a shock, you don’t expect it." Police remain on the street today as they investigate the explosion. Residents spent the night in temporary accommodation but have this morning been allowed to return to their homes - even though some remain without power. Photos show the destruction caused by the explosion, with huge debris outside the property in question.  Gas experts say it is "too early" to determine the cause of the blast. A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: "Emergency services attended Brownley Road, Manchester, at about 6:30pm tonight (31 March 2022) after reports of a gas explosion. Sadly, a man was located deceased inside a property. A number of houses were evacuated and the scene made safe at about 8pm. "Several properties are without power and emergency services remain on scene this evening with road closures in place. Investigations are ongoing and officers are supporting the deceased man's family." A spokesperson for Cadent said last night: "The thoughts of everyone at Cadent are with those affected by the incident in Brownley Road, Wythenshawe on Thursday evening. It is too early to speculate on the cause of the explosion and our engineers remain on site to assist with the investigation."
