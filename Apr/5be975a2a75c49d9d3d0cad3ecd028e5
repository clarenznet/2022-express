Eira the lamb came into the care of Woodfield Animal Sanctuary in Wales earlier this month when she could not move her legs. She has developed a strong bond with Holly the dog, who looks after her like she is one of her own puppies. Eira is undergoing physiotherapy to help her mobility issues and the charity says motherly Holly, who was rescued from a puppy farm in 2018, is helping her feel "loved and safe". Robbie Bartington, who founded the sanctuary with her husband David Wallis, said: "Holly washes Eira from head to toe every day. "Then when Eira is very tired after her physio Holly curls up with her head on Eira’s back, as if to say, 'Just rest and I will look after you'. "Holly was a mum to so many puppies and it’s so sad to think that all those puppies were taken from her. "Luckily when we rescued Holly we managed to bring her last two puppies home with her. "Holly has such a strong maternal instinct and is being a very special mum to Eira and helping her progress and feel loved and safe." Adorable photos and videos show Holly washing little Eira and snuggling up to sleep with her.
