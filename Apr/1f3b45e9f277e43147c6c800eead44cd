  Diane started her acting career on stage when she appeared in the original 1968 Broadway production of the musical Hair, receiving a Tony Award for her performance. She then went on to star in Woody Allen's comic play Play it Again, Sam, which sparked a close partnership with the director, who created some of her most memorable roles. The pair worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Diane has said that Woody remains one of her closest friends despite the controversy surrounding the 86-year-old filmmaker. Diane rose to prominence when she starred in 1972’s The Godfather and went on to reprise her role as Kay Adams in both of its sequels.  She then went on to star in Woody’s 1972 film adaptation of Play It Again, Sam, and their next two films together Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975) helped establish her as a comic actor. Romantic comedy Annie Hall (1977) became the film that Diane is still arguably the most associated with, and it led her to win the Academy Award for Best Actress. Moving away from comedy, Diane also starred in other more dramatic films, including Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and Interiors (1978). She also notably starred as Nina Banks in Father of the Bride (1991) and its sequels Part II (1995) and Part 3(ish) (2020).
