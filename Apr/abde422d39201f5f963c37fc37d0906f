Six years later after the UK voted to leave the EU, the topic of Scottish independence is still high on Nicola Sturgeon’s agenda - despite Boris Johnson refusing to allow one and branding the idea as “irresponsible”. The SNP’s Commons Leader Ian Blackford said this morning that his party were elected in Scotland to “deliver that independence referendum”. Speaking to the BBC this morning, he said: “We have been given a mandate by the people of Scotland. It is the right of the people of Scotland. And of course everything that we are facing at the moment: the cost of living crisis, the fact we have a Government in London with no moral authority, the fact we are facing the cost of living crisis but of course the root of all that is the cost that we now have with Brexit as well.” Even though the UK as a whole voted to 52 percent to leave the EU, Scotland was decisively against Brexit, with 62 percent of voters choosing to stay with the EU. The SNP has argued that the last Scottish Independence referendum, held in 2014, was at a time when the UK’s position on Brexit was unclear, given that then Prime Minister David Cameron announced a referendum would be later held in 2013. Ms Sturgeon has made it clear in the years since the vote that Scotland would attempt to rejoin the EU should it be freed from the ties of Westminster. So, do you think Scotland has the right to a second independence referendum after Brexit? Do you think Scotland should leave the UK and join ranks with the EU once again?
