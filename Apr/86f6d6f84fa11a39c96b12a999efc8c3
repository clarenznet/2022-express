Amanda Holden is not shy about her showcasing her incredible physique on social media as the Britain's Got Talent judge did exactly that for her legion of loyal followers. The Heart FM presenter decided to get in a small amount of exercise ahead of her radio broadcast in a show-stopping moment. The 51-year-old ensured she burned some calories at the start of the day but decided to keep her work attire on. The presenter sported an orange patterned mini dress from Karen Millen, with a zip neckline and long-sleeved, skater skirt design. The BGT judge looked radiant with light makeup, dark eyeliner and a soft pink lip, as her blonde tresses flowed in loose curls down her shoulders. Amanda added a silver bead bracelet to the chic ensemble, as she kept the rest of her accessories to a minimum. The age-defying beauty completed her look with pair of open-toed heels. Taking to her Instagram stories, Amanda shared a cheeky video in view of her 1.8 million followers, where she could be seen bouncing up and down on an exercise ball. She captioned the clip: "Bouncing into Tuesday." Earlier in the day, she shared gorgeous snaps of herself relaxing at Heart FM's studios in a mustard mini dress. She showed off her toned legs in the picture as she leaned back on top of the table, giving fans a glimpse of her footwear.
