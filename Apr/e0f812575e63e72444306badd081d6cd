The 96-year-old Monarch beamed with delight as she held an audience with the President of Switzerland. She has experienced mobility problems in the past few months, but stood without a walking stick when she met Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle. Her Majesty wore a blue and grey paisley-patterned silk dress with a sapphire and diamond brooch, inherited from the Queen Mother, for the audience. It was her first official engagement since returning from her break at Wood Farm. The cottage on her 20,000-acre Sandringham estate in Norfolk is where her late husband, Prince Philip, spent much of his time after he retired from public duties in 2017. On most days during her stay there, the Queen went to see her racehorses. Since spending a night in hospital for an unexplained reason in October, the Monarch has been confined to mainly light duties, such as going through paperwork and hosting occasional in-person and more regular virtual audiences with foreign heads of state, senior military officers and diplomats. She can now look forward to her Platinum Jubilee celebrations, which are just weeks away. Preparations for a four-day Bank Holiday weekend in June to mark her 70-year reign were well underway yesterday, with workmen busy placing a big decorative crown at the top of a flag pole at Buckingham Palace. The Queen hopes to be at many Jubilee events and is expected to commute from Windsor – now her permanent base – to London. But her attendance will only be confirmed on the days themselves if she is feeling well. Buckingham Palace says Her Majesty also hopes to attend the State Opening of Parliament on May 10 – one of the most important events in the royal calendar. Prince Charles will stand in for her if she is not feeling up to it. The Queen has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her long reign. The Lord Chancellor stood in for her in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and then Prince Edward.
