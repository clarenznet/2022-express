Earlier this week, the first footage of Avatar 2 was unveiled for journalists at CinemaCon in Las Vegas. Now James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water first images have found their way online, showing off what the director’s been working on for the last decade in what will be the first of four sequels. What’s undoubtedly clear is the improvement on the already lush motion-capture special effects. One still sees a Na’vi touching a large water alien, while another shows the blue creatures preparing for battle on the ocean. We also have first looks, as shared by T2BLive.COM, at what appears to be Sam Worthington’s Jake Sully in his Na’vi form and Zoe Saldana’s Neytiri. The first teaser trailer is set to be shown ahead of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in cinemas next week. The footage, which was described as “stunning” at CinemaCon, will then be put online by Disney the following week.

Avatar 2 director James Cameron 'worried' [AVATAR 2] The new blockbuster’s official plot synopsis reads: “Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way Of Water begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.” The 2009 original Avatar, the highest-grossing movie of all time, is set to return remastered to US movies theatres on September 23, so fingers crossed for UK cinemas. Avatar: The Way of Water will be released exclusively in cinemas on December 16, 2022.
