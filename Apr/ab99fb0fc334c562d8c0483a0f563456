Sandy Croly refused to pick up "much bigger" Kelly Ann Smith because she was worried about her unborn baby. A tribunal report said: "Ms Smith replied that if she would not lift her, there was 'no point' in her being there because she was 'useless'."   The 31 year old, from Nottingham, ended up lifting her employer into bed but was sacked just days later. The tribunal panel ruled that Miss Croly be awarded Â£24,432 for pregnancy discrimination and race discrimination.
