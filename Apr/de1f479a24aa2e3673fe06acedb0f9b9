Hugh Raymond Holmes had taken a Vauxhall Astra from the woman's son and was driving it "dangerously" when it fell from the A177 flyover in Durham and landed on the central reservation of the A1(M) on January 21. Judge Ray Singh told the 32-year-old he was "utterly despicable". Holmes admitted aggravated vehicle taking, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and without insurance and failing to provide a specimen of breath. Prosecutor Robin Patton told Durham Crown Court that Holmes, of Spennymoor, Co Durham, kicked his door open to get out but left the woman trapped unconscious inside. The passenger is wheelchairbound after suffering a bleed on the brain, a broken neck and multiple spine fractures.
