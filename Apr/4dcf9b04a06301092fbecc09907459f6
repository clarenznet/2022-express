NHS England said it will help medics detect excessive movement, immobility and sleep disturbance, allowing them to adjust physio and prescriptions. Hundreds of patients have been issued with the device during a pilot, and they are due to be rolled out to the 120,000 sufferers in England. John Whipps, who was diagnosed with the illness in 2007, said: "Parkinson's changes day to day, and even throughout each day. "This really gives you confidence as it gives accurate recordings and you don't rely so much on your perception." NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: "Not only is it better for these people living with Parkinson's, but it's more efficient for the NHS, freeing space and time."
