Food recalls can occur for several reasons. One of the most common causes is that the food packaging is incorrect, including misleading information, an incorrect ingredients level or undeclared allergens. Food products can also be recalled if there are any biological, physical, or chemical hazards found in the food that may harm a consumer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) explained food recalls on their website. They stated: "If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). "The FSA issues Product Withdrawal Information Notices and Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food. The FSA concluded: "In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers."
