Judd Trump delighted the crowd at the Crucible for his World Snooker Championship quarter-final clash with Stuart Bingham by distracting referee Ben Williams. With Trump hoping to make a century break, the 32-year-old found himself snookered behind the pink while needing to pot the brown. And in a cheeky attempt to keep the break going, Trump tricked Williams by pointing to the crowd and distracting him. Trump then quickly moved the pink with his hand and rushed his shot, hitting the brown but failing to pot it. And by the time Williams turned around the blue had rolled into the bottom left pocket. Commentator David Hendon said on Eurosport: "Fantastic. Ben Williams fell right for that, didn’t he. 'Look away, I’ll move the pink'. JUST IN: Mark Williams fumed at World Snooker: ‘Pathetic!’ "Things are turning round for Trump, he’s enjoying it suddenly. That was like something out of a sitcom." Trump is currently level with Bingham in their quarter-final match, with the game 8-8 heading into the final session. He won the final three frames of the morning session to draw level. The winner of their match will face either Mark Williams or Yan Bingtao in the semi-finals, with their game also level at 8-8. Ronnie O'Sullivan is currently the only player to have made the final four, having beaten Stephen Maguire 13-5.

"There is a toolbox, you try and use everything in there and play your own game. "I'd rather not be playing here because it is a hard tournament. I've always said that this and the Masters are my two worst tournaments. "I actually prefer going to Leicester to play in the Championship League, but you kind of have to show up to this one and give this one your best."
