The security cases, normally reserved for the most expensive products, have been used to protect protein bars, which are sold for around £1.50. The security devices have been used in two north Manchester stores. In light of the move, one Middleton branch customer implied the shop was "rough". Sharing a picture of shelves filled with the individually locked protein bars, Mark Baxendale wrote: "I am not saying Middleton Tesco’s is rough but the protein bars are in security boxes." The Tesco branches, in Middleton and Blackley, have also put cases on other bizarre low-priced products, such as £3 fake eyelashes and £5 anti-wrinkle creams. Other items protected by the devices included head lice treatment shampoo, lube, £2.75 Harry Potter Ooshies, £3.50 Lego Super Mario character pack and phone cases. According to the Manchester Evening News, the products are among the most shoplifted products at the store. The Blackley branch of Tesco sells fake eyelashes and toothpaste in security boxes. The devices trigger an alarm if a customer tries to leave a store without paying. In order for a customer to leave the store with the item, checkout staff must remove the case. The devices are typically used for high-value items, such as expensive bottles of alcohol and video games. A spokesperson for Tesco said: "A small number of items are kept in security boxes to deter shoplifters. "Customers can still purchase these items simply by bringing them to the checkout where our colleagues will open the box." Tesco has previously faced controversy for using the same security cases to protect £1.10 bars of chocolate from being stolen. A customer, called Thom, said: "I went into Tesco on Park Street, Bristol and all of the large chocolate bars were being housed in perspex security boxes. "It was funny because almost everything else around them was of higher value but had no security. "I actually asked the guy at the till and he didn't know why they were boxed."
