Simon Cowell, 62, attended the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, where he reunited with his America's Got Talent co-stars yesterday. The music mogul posed with Terry Crews, Sofia Vergara, Howie Mandel and Heidi Klum on the star-studded red carpet. The TV stars looked phenomenal as they smiled for the cameras, with Simon looking very different after he admittedly stopped getting dermal fillers. Taking to the red carpet, Simon sported his landmark outfit consisting of a grey long-sleeved t-shirt and black trousers. He recently spoke out on his decision to ditch the aesthetic procedures and his son Eric’s reaction to the pictures of his face before he had fillers. Simon said: “There was a stage where I might have gone a bit too far. I saw a picture of me from ‘before’ the other day, and didn’t recognise it as me first of all. “Eric was in hysterics. Enough was enough. There is no filler in my face at all now. Zero. “There was a phase where everyone was having their faces pumped full of this and the other. But actually, for me now, a lot of it comes down to healthy eating and drinking tonnes of water," he added to The Sun.
