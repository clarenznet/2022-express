In a chilling televised address, the Russian President said: “We have tools no-one else can boast of. We don't want to brag about them…we will use them.” The Kremlin leader, addressing lawmakers in St Petersburg, warned that his country’s response to anyone who 'threatens' Russia would be 'lightning-fast' and deadly.  The popular host - known as ‘Putin’s voice’ - said he made the threat because the British had been “totally boorish” in voicing the UK’s support for Ukraine - a reference to comments made by Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. And welcoming the new weapons to the Kremlin's armoury, President Putin said: “This is a big, significant event in the development of advanced weapons systems of the Russian army."  The Kremlin’s warning that it could target military sites in the UK because of British open support for Ukraine, and could also hit British diplomats returning to Kyiv, came after Mr Heappey’s 'provocative' talk of backing Ukrainian bombing of Russia. But Moscow's threat of a "proportional response" against Britain for backing Ukrainian strikes behind Russian lines was branded "unlawful" by Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab.  According to the Interfax news agency, the Russian defence ministry said: "We would like to stress that the direct provoking by London of the Kyiv regime into such activities, should there be an attempt to realise them, will immediately lead to our proportional response." While the Russian statement did not make clear its possible target, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that diplomats will return to the British embassy in Kyiv this week.
