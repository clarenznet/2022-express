NBC's Today show said its presenter Hoda Kotb had spoken to the Duke of Sussex at the Invictus Games in the Netherlands. He discussed his and Meghan's secret meeting with the Queen last week, the couple's life in California and their visit to the games for injured military veterans in The Hague. Harry, 37, will also discuss on the US TV network fatherhood and life with Archie, two, and 10-month-old Lilibet. In a separate interview, with American magazine People, he has told how his daughter has taken her first steps, saying "her current priorities are trying to keep up with her brother".The full NBC interview is due to be screened on its breakfast show today. It comes 13 months after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey when the couple accused the Firm of racism towards Archie and of neglecting Meghan. On Monday he told the BBC the Queen "had plenty of messages for Team UK". He added: "It was great to see her and I'm sure she would love to be here if she could." In the Dutch capital yesterday he met Lieutenant General Lance K Landrum, the deputy chair of Nato. He also tried his hand at golf and table tennis. His ping-pong opponent, Sandra Mikolaschek, 24, said he was "very talented".
