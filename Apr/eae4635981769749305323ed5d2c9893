Debbie Flynn woke up to find a mystery silver Vauxhall Mokka next to her garage off Outmore Road, Garrett's Green, on Wednesday morning. Ms Flynn believes the owner has parked the vehicle there to go on holiday after being sold the space by fraudsters as she is not far from Birmingham Airport. The mum-of-two said West Midlands Police confirmed the car was not stolen but could not take any action as it is a civil rather than criminal matter. Ms Flynn said: "It's like the car just dropped out of the sky. "It's a complete mystery. "We don't understand how or why this has happened but as the owner hasn't returned all week, we suspect it's due to someone selling a space on my drive close to the airport." Ms Flynn said she and her partner went to bed at around 10.30pm on Tuesday and woke up on Wednesday to the car outside their house. She told Birmingham Live: "The cheeky g*ts opened my gate and parked it and shut the gates after leaving it on the grass. "The police officer who came to see us said he had never seen anything like this in all his years. "I am fuming because there is no law to stop anyone parking on your drive.  "It's totally legal so the police can't help. "Yet if we try and move it and damage it, then we would have committed a criminal offence. "The kids can't even play outside on the drive now, in case they kick a ball or something and accidentally damage it. "Police said there are parking apps used by scammers who advertise unsuspecting people's drives as parking spaces and charge the car owners a fee." Ms Flynn has chained the tyre of the car so the owner will need to knock on her door when they return. She added: "I want answers - when, how, why and who did you pay? "We just have to sit and wait for the owners to return. "Itâ€™s an absolute joke. "I'm furious and disgusted that any Tom, Dick and Harry can park on your drive and you can't do a thing about it."
