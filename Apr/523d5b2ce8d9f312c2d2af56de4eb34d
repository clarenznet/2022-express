If you've been keeping up with your PC gaming, then you're probably familiar with Epic's weekly game giveaway. Available to download and keep, PC users can claim the weekly titles by visiting the Epic Games Store and redeeming the freebies. This week's games include rogue-lite survival game Insurmountable, as well as strategy masterpiece XCOM 2. You'll have to hurry however, because the games won't be around for long. Indeed, if you want to take advantage of this amazing free game giveaway, you only have until 4pm BST on April 21. If you're interested in downloading Insurmountable and XCOM 2, you'll need to sign up for an Epic Games account. The games will then be yours to keep. XCOM 2 is undoubtedly the highlight, featuring deep turn-based combat, as well as an interesting upgrade system. Between missions, players must spend funds researching new technology, hiring new soldiers and developing powerful weapons. "Earth has changed. 20 years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces. "XCOM, the planetâ€™s last line of defence, was left decimated and scattered. Now, in XCOM 2, the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order." Insurmountable, on the other hand, sees players attempt to survive extreme weather and overcome huge mountains. "Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. "Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range." This week's games will be replaced by two additional titles on April 21, when Amnesia Rebirth and Riverbond join the line-up.
