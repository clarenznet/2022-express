Mehraab Nazir, 49, was on holiday in the Blue Mountains, a national park west of Sydney, with his wife and three children when tragedy struck on Monday. Rocks started to fall on the group and Mr Nazir and his youngest son, who has not yet been named, were killed.  Their bodies were recovered next day. His wife Ana and eldest son, aged 14, were critically injured and flown to a hospital in Sydney. She is fighting for her life while the teenage boy is now stable.Their daughter, 15, went to get help, then led emergency crews to the scene. Mr Nazir was a partner atWatson Farley & Williams, in Singapore. He was working as a finance lawyer, having left London 10 years ago.  Yesterday the firm said: "It is with the greatest sadness we must confirm that our dear friend and colleague Mehraab Nazir, a partner in our Singapore office, tragically lost his life in a landslide in Australia earlier this week alongside his young son." New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the deaths "tragic" and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the track should have been open given recent heavy rain. He said: "The Blue Mountains is one of the wonders of the world, but when tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act."?
