Product recalls occur as a result of safety or quality concerns that pose an obvious or potential hazard to consumers. This may be due to incorrect packaging, undeclared allergens, misleading claims or incorrect labels. The FSA stated: "If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product)."
