Gareth Wyn Jones "harassed and bullyied" the vegan community, according to TikTok, by brandishing a turnip in a video and stating vegetables are often fertilised by livestock manure. Gareth, who often uses the platform to share insights into life on his farm in Llanfairfechan, north Wales, received a "powerful" backlash to the clip by campaign groups.  TikTok, a popular video sharing site, threw Gareth off the platform hours after he uploaded the clip. The dad of three has since appealed against the decision, North Wales Live reports. Speaking from the farm today, Gareth said: "This is the second time I’ve been blocked by them and I’m not that bothered. "I’m still on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. All I did was have a bit of fun. To be honest, I’ve actually been quite well-behaved recently. "We have to question the impact on freedom of speech when pressure groups can get people banned from online platforms." In the video, Gareth clutches a turnip and says: "I’ll tell you why I’m not a vegan and never will be – because I’m a farmer." But veganism is a rapidly growing dietary choice that expounds a "cruelty-free" lifestyle choice which is less harmful to the planet. The position has often irked livestock farmers, who have been less adept at addressing attacks on their profession. Gareth's large following was dismayed at the ban. One wrote online: "So TikTok agrees to harassment of working people who feed the nation?" Another posted: "That’s the trouble with today’s youngsters, so easily offended!" A third said: "He should be allowed his opinion expressed. It's a shame they banned him."
