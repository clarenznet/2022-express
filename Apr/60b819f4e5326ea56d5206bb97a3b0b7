Last week, the Duke of York accompanied the Queen, 95, to the memorial service for her husband of 73 years Prince Philip. Mother and son arrived together and used a separate entrance to the other royals, and the monarch was seen holding onto Andrew’s arm while also clutching a walking stick. The event marked Andrew's first public appearance since settling his out-of-court civil suit with his accuser Virginia Giuffre. He has vehemently denied all claims against him. Following their appearance at the event, there are now reports the Duke of York will chaperone his mother to the Epsom race meet in June. However, a source claims the Duke “doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry” that arose from his appearance at the memorial. A source said: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour. “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.” The Duke's prominence at the event was met with a mixed response from commentators and the public alike. Body language expert Judi James claimed his position as the monarch’s right-hand man saw him shadowing Prince Philip’s role as consort, while Vanity Fair's Royal Editor Katie Nicholl claims the move signifies the monarch "believes he's innocent. She made the point very, very clearly". FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
