Coastguard patrol boats, a helicopter and aircraft were scrambled after the crew of Kazu I reported it was filling with water and sinking off the northern island of Hokkaido at around 1.15pm (5.15am BST) yesterday. The crew had said the boat, which is understood to have been on a three-hour sightseeing voyage around the Shiretoko Peninsula, was tipping at a 30-degree angle. Contact was then lost with the vessel and after several hours, the coastguard asked the Air Self-Defence Force to join in the search-and rescue operation. Local fishing boats had returned to port earlier in the day reporting strong winds and high waves at sea. Kazu I can hold up to 65 people and it is believed the two crew and 24 passengers, which included two children, were all wearing life jackets.  InTokyo, the transport ministry said it would set up a task force to deal with the accident. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed his Cabinet members to "do everything in their power to save lives", a government official said. The Shiretoko Peninsula is a Unesco designated world heritage site known for wildlife, including the endangered Steller sea lion, migratory birds and brown bears. Temperatures in the area can dip as low as 0C at night.
