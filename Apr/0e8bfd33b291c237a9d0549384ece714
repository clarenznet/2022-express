A Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules and a Lockheed C-130 Hercules put out emergency 7700 squawk codes as they flew south from Yorkshire towards Oxfordshire. The 7700 code is said to represent a general emergency and could include an engineering issue onboard the aircraft.    Both of the RAF aircraft are flying at an altitude above 5,000 feet. The squawk code was issued at around 12.30am in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Hercules planes, an aircraft which was first brought into service in 1999, appear to be heading towards RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. RAF Brize Norton is the largest Royal Air Force base in the entire country.

The Lockheed C-130 Hercules touched down at around 1.03am. The first Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules arrived at RAF Brize Norton shortly after at 1.07am.

The aircraft then returned to RAF Brize Norton after flying over Tewkesbury at 1.14am. According to the RAF website, the Hercules is the "primary tactical transport aircraft" and has been the "backbone of the UK operational-tactical mobility tasks".
