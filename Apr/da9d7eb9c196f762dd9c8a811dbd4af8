The Bolton-born comedian has not performed live since he cited "unforeseen family circumstances" for cancelling pre-Christmas shows more than four years ago. The hugely popular funny man, 48, is doing a series of Dance for Life shows in Manchester, Liverpool and London. All profits will go to Cancer Research UK. The shows, billed as "the dance-a-thon party that will change lives", feature sing-a-long and dance-along performances with Peter in charge of the music interspersed with jokes.  His broad grin and irresistible antics have proved a hit with fans, helping him to fill more than 75 arenas since 2016. Most comedians have been out of the spotlight for the past couple of years, outside of virtual appearances and posts on social media, due to the impact of Covid on the entertainment industry. Peter's absences have extended beyond that, with the much-loved star having been away from the stage since 2017. The following year, he made merely the briefest of appearances in the name of charity at a screening for his Car Share series. It wasn't until August 2021 when he made anything resembling a comeback, but delighted fans gave him a standing ovation when he arrived at Manchester's O2 Apollo for a charity Q&A. "I've never in my life had a standing ovation when I came on," the star joked of the dramatic reaction after his long absence. He then shot back cheekily: "I'm going to go away for four more years." However, the latest shows - along with the launch of his new Instagram account - point to the idea that he could be making a full comeback. For his devoted fans, the news couldn't have come sooner. Peter has also confirmed that he is writing a new autobiography, despite having previously released one, titled The Sound Of Laughter, 15 years ago.
