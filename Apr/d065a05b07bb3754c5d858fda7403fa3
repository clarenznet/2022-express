Only one in three (36 percent) said MPs have done enough to combat unwanted sexual behaviour. These range from verbal comments to physical actions, children’s rights charity Plan UK found in its poll of 2,000 adults. Charity chief executive Rose Caldwell said: “Women and girls are facing public sexual harassment every day – they are being followed, shouted at, groped and exposed to unwanted sexual advances. Enough is enough. “We have laws to prevent people from spitting chewing gum on the street, but we have no single piece of legislation to protect girls from public sexual harassment.” The Daily Express has partnered with Our Streets Now and Plan UK to call for Britain’s streets to be made safer for women.
