Dermot O’Leary was left baffled on This Morning during a segment on popular discount storms on Friday. The ITV presenter was forced to ask co-host Alison Hammond what their guest was referring to when he was asked if he’d ever visited B&M or Home Bargains. However, This Morning viewers couldn’t get over Dermot’s confusion. Dermot and Alison were discussing the best discounts of the week with Coupon Queen Holly Smith. She remarked: “This is a cracking deal. Strawberry Ribena 850ml so the retail price on this is £2 but in Home Bargains this week 49p.” “Oh brilliant,” Alison remarked as Dermot interjected: “Tell us about Home Bargains.” “What?” Holly asked and Dermot clarified: “Is that a website?” “It’s a shop babes,” Alison told her co-host and Holly asked: “Do you not know what Home Bargains is?” Read more: 'Would YOU live in Rwanda?'

I’ll have to take you out,” Alison quipped. “It’s great you’ll love it you can get everything for your house as well.” “What do you get there?” Dermot asked and Alison replied: “Everything, literally everything.” “Whoever the MD of Home Bargains is he'll be very happy we’ve said it about 20 times,” Dermot joked. Alison added: “We should do a VT of taking Dermot [to Home Bargains].” “Have you ever been to B&M?” Holly asked and Alison replied: “No, he hasn’t.” A confused Dermot asked his co-host: “What’s that?” “I’m going to have to bring you back down to earth,” Alison joked.
