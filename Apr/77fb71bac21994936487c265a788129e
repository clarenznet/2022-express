YouTube viewers need to be on guard when going through the comment section of the video sharing website. Popular content creators are warning of a widespread scam where con-artists pose as the person behind the YouTube channel a user is visiting. In the comments section the scammer responds to viewers' comments telling them they've just won a glitzy prize such as a free PS5 or Nintendo Switch console. The bogus account then encourages YouTube users to contact them directly through platforms such as Telegram or WhatsApp, and give them the account details they need to send a message. However, this is all simply part of an elaborate to trick people into sending their hard-earned cash to con-artists. One of the popular YouTubers to alert their viewers to this scam is Metal Jesus Rocks.  On Twitter the retro gaming collector said: "ATTN: There is a SCAM where fake accounts pretend to be YouTubers in video comments telling you that you've won a free PS5 or Switch & then direct you to a WhatApp or Telegram account for more info. THIS IS NOT REAL! Please don't fall for it." Responding to this comment Jake Randall, a YouTuber known for helping people secure PS5 and Xbox Series X stock, tweeted: "Ah my life for the last 2 years. I’m sorry they have moved to other creators as well, it’s a huge problem." Elsewhere tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee also created a video outlining the scam.  The YouTube star said he receives a dozen emails every day from viewers that have fallen victim to the scam, sending over money that is allegedly meant to be used for the prizes they've won. Money is usually sent via PayPal and can cost between £75 to £150. Advising people on how to stay safe from the scams, Brownlee said: "Myself, and other creators, will never ask you for money or for a shipping address, or to DM [direct message] us on Telegram. And if we do have a giveaway going on, we have verified accounts and we'll never message you from any other account. So, if you click on an account and it doesn't go to our [YouTube] channel, that's a pretty good sign."
