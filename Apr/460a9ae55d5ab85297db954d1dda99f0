Joe Franks, who runs the busy Open Jar eateries in Hartlepool, County Durham, said employers do not appreciate requests from parents about work for offspring. He has received a "crazy amount" of messages "on behalf of their child" recently but rarely hires any of the young people. The business owner said: "If they need their parent to apply for a job, how can they do a shift and speak to 100-plus people?" "I honestly can't stress enough how much that this is the wrong way around, approaching someone for a position in their business. "All the hiring in The Open Jar is done by the management on site. So making a right first impression with them is definitely the way to go, rather than thinking my dad has the owner on Facebook so therefore that's the easiest route. "If they're going to hide behind their parents, what happens if they have a really busy night or something doesn't go to plan? And it's not me that they're working with, it's the manager or supervisor they have to click with, so they're barking up the wrong tree anyway." Some messages, Joe said, are riddled with spelling and grammar errors. Joe told Teesside Live children instead should "ensure they are well-presented" and go door-to-door seeing managers in person, armed with "100 CVs". Joe added: "When people come in with the right bubbly personality, well presented, they're the people that always end up with a job. Even if we don't have anything at the time and we ring them back a few months later. "Also, they should be coming down in person to see if the venue is for them, just as much as the other way round - it's a two-way street. "Hope this approach helps people find work whether it be with The Open Jar or elsewhere."
