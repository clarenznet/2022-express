The former Jim McDonald actor agreed with GB News' Dan Wootton that soaps don't "reflect reality" and argued people "start to switch off" over boxes being ticked "with heavy black ink". It came as Wootton chatted to Charlie and fellow soap stars Sherrie Hewson and Tina Malone in the wake of June Brown's death. Dan had argued: "I don't think that is what viewers want, they want a soap to reflect real life, not this idealised world." "Yeah you're absolutely right," Charlie agreed with the GB News host. He added: "We're great at being a silent majority in this b***** country over a great deal of things and I try not to be, to my detriment." The 62-year-old went on to add: "[There's] always new things that you can't do and you can do and I despair and that goes across society in my humble opinion." More to follow...
