While Her Majesty struggles with sad memories a year after Prince Philip’s death, the loss of several old friends, and her own increasing frailty, the short meeting with her grandson and his wife will have lifted her spirits. The Queen will never pull up the drawbridge on Harry, no matter how saddened she might feel over his and Meghan’s allegations in last year’s Oprah Winfrey interview. The Queen is a model of fortitude and forgiveness.  However, her outlook does not reflect the attitudes of some other royals who were hurt by the Sussexes’ accusations. Until their visit to Windsor Castle, Harry and Meghan’s only known link with the wider family was through his cousin Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, who visited them in Los Angeles in February. Thursday’s visit marks a moment when a more hopeful alliance might be possible with the prince and his wife who left as senior royals for life in America. Charles had a brief meeting with Harry and Meghan. That would have been difficult considering Harry’s claim that Charles cut him off financially. Sadly, neither Charles nor the Queen have met the Sussexes’ daughter Lilibet or seen son Archie since he was a baby. One notable absentee from Thursday’s meeting was Prince William, on holiday with his family skiing in Courchevel. The brothers’ feud shows no sign of thawing, despite their brief encounters last year at Prince Philip’s funeral and the unveiling of the statue of their mother Princess Diana. The Queen may hope Charles and Harry build on their meeting, although a reunification is realistically a long way off. But the Queen’s exemplar of tolerance and conciliation may show a better way for them all.
