The vandals toppled five bins, a three-tier flower planter and wrecked children's play equipment at Pescod Square Shopping Centre in Boston, Lincolnshire, late last night. Photographs show the trail of destruction bosses at the centre found to their horror this morning. Lisa Dawson, shopping centre manager, said: "We are devastated. "There's absolutely no reason for this to have happened. It's just mindless. The children's activity centre has only been in for two to three days." CCTV captured the vandalism, Lincolnshire Live reports, and the shopping centre has contacted the police. It posted on its Facebook page: "We are absolutely devastated after waking to discover mindless vandalism here at Pescod Square. "So many of our little people were enjoying our new additions. Luckily CCTV captured everything." The playground equipment was only recently installed at Pescod Square, which is in the centre of the market town near the North Sea coast. Regular shoppers there expressed their ire online today. "This is awful. Glad you've got CCTV. This is happening too often," one woman posted on Facebook. Another shopper said: "This is absolutely disgusting, I brought my little girl into town the other day and I saw this and thought it was such a lovely thing to do for the little ones and then some idiots think it’s ok to damage this, they clearly don’t have any respect. "What is this town coming to?" A third stated: "Oh for goodness sake... why? What on earth is the purpose of this? It’s absolutely disgusting! What a terrible shame. If you need any help putting any of it back together, please say." A Boston Borough Council spokesman said: "Mindless vandalism of this nature is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. "It sounds like on this occasion Pescod's excellent CCTV cameras have captured the offenders. Once identification has occurred, then the process of seeing what criminal and/or ASB sanctions can be sought will begin."
