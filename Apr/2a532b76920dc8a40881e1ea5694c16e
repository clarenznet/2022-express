Anwar Hosseni, 24, vandalised the structure just weeks after it opened to the public. Bereaved families were furious after a series of stratch marks were found in the white marble in Manchester city centre on February 9. But Hosseni has now pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage and will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on May 4. Tameside Magistrates' Court heard it was "no secret" now the damage had been caused. Hosseni, wearing jeans and a jacket with a small daffodil in his lapel, spoke only to confirm his date of birth and address in Salford, Greater Manchester, during the brief hearing. It was heard today in court that Hosseni had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing, reports Manchester Evening News.  District Judge Mark Hadfield told Hosseni: "You have pleaded guilty to this offence and will receive full credit for doing so. The amount of damage means this is to serious to be dealt with at the magistrates' court. At this stage it will be remitted to Manchester Crown Court for sentence." Hosseni was released on bail on condition he lives at his address in Salford and does not enter a specified area around the memorial. Bereaved families have made personalised memory capsules containing mementos and messages which are embedded inside the halo. The tribute was conceived as a living memorial - a peaceful garden space for remembrance and reflection, featuring plants which grow naturally in the UK countryside and which have been selected to provide year-round colour and echo the changing seasons.
