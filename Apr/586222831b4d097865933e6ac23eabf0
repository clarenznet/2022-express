Madonna, 63, did not hold back last night as she posted a racy bum picture featuring a very explicit message. The Material Girl singer took to Instagram, where she enjoys a following of 17.9 million, to share a photo of what appeared to be her perky derriere. The shot was posted twice with the cryptic captions “I mean it ……..” and “I Really. Do”. It featured a close-up look at her lace thong, which was visible under see-through Gucci tights. A pair of tattooed hands could be seen holding a silver chain over the pop star’s bum that read “F**k you”. The risqué post comes after reports emerged that the singer had broken up with her boyfriend Ahlamalik Williams, 28. The pair are said to have parted ways after a three-year romance, with a source claiming to The Sun that “it was hard to keep their romance alight.” Express.co.uk has contacted a representative for Madonna for comment.
