With just weeks to go until the birth, the Umbrella singer, 34, wore an Alaïa one-piece with matching heels. She then showcased her bump, in amazing images by iconic photographer Annie Leibovitz.  In an accompanying interview, Rihanna wants the shoot to inspire for pregnant women, saying: "I'm hoping that we were able to redefine what's considered 'decent' for pregnant women. My body is doing incredible things right now, and I'm not going to be ashamed of that." The star admits the pregnancy with US rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky was unplanned, saying: "I always thought it would be marriage first, then a baby."  Vogue's May issue is available on April 26.
