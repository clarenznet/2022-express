The supermarket giant, which gives away thousands of deals through its Clubcard scheme, has come under fire for charging so much more for items without a Clubcard. One customer spotted an item on sale for £16 for those with the Clubcard and £40 for those without one. They tweeted: said: "This is dreadful… if you can sell it at £16 then sell it at £16. The Clubcards are literally free of charge so what is the point? "You don’t gain anything from Clubcards. £40 is absolutely ridiculous. Seeing these crazy prices more and more in Tesco, it really is shocking!" A photograph, shared on Twitter and seen by Bristol Live, appears to show Tesco charging £2.90 for Nescafe Azera coffee with a Clubcard, and £6 without it. One social media user reacted: "Tesco Clubcards are probably skewing the real (much higher) inflation stats." Another posted: "Tesco has basically turned into a tech company; they are enforcing Clubcards now to get your shopping data. Crate of Bud Light £16 or £9 with a Clubcard. Sneaky sneaky." Data released this week showed how food bills have seen an increase of nearly six percent since this time last year despite households purchasing less. It's the biggest increase since December 2011.  A Tesco spokesperson said: "Through Clubcard Prices, we’re giving more than 20 million customers access to thousands of exclusive deals on everything from everyday staples like fruit and veg to treats like prosecco and ice-cream. "It’s easy and free to sign up, and customers can register on the Tesco Grocery & Clubcard app, website or in store to start saving straight away."
