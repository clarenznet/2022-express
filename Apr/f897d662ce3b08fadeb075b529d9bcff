His current and former wives and all five of their daughters are together as a "full supporting cast" to help the star, following his aphasia diagnosis and decision to quit acting. The potentially devastating condition causes a loss of basic communication skills such as the ability to speak, read or write, as well as being unable to comprehend everyday words. More than a third of victims also suffer depression but the actor's loved ones have vowed to stay by his side. Ex-wife Demi Moore, 59, posted on Instagram that she is "thankful for our blended family". She said: "We are moving through this as a strong family unit." The couple's three daughters - Rumer, 33, Scout, 30, and Tallulah, 28 - posed with their parents alongside Bruce's current wife, British model and actress Emma Heming, 43. Bruce, who turned 67 last month and has stepped back from making movies, has two daughters with Emma - Mabel Ray, 10, and Evelyn, seven. Emma declared in an interview: "He is absolutely adored by this great big family that surrounds him. He is the greatest love of my life." The Hollywood star - whose huge hits include the Die Hard series, The Sixth Sense and Armageddon - is being tipped for a lifetime achievement Oscar next year.
