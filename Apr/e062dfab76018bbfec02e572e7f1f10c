Causes behind the sudden rise in cases of hepatitis - inflamation of the liver - are being investigated by the UK Health Security Agency. However, officials stressed there is no link to the Covid-19 vaccine as none of the children affected were known to have had a jab. Health chiefs added that the investigation pointed towards a group of viruses called adenoviruses, that usually cause a range of mild illnesses such as colds, vomiting and diarrhoea. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said: "We are working with the NHS and public health colleagues to swiftly investigate a wide range of possible factors which may be causing children to be admitted to hospital with liver inflammation. "Information gathered through our investigations increasingly suggests that this is linked to adenovirus infection. However, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes."
