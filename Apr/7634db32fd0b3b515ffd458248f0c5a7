Footage taken by an upset resident in Atherton, Greater Manchester, shows the staff chopping branches off the tree. The pink petals are seen falling to the ground in the clip, which has been shared online. Locals asked the workers if they were sure they really had the correct tree, but the operation continued until the stunning plant was brought down entirely today. One resident, who didn't want to be named, said: "I'm heartbroken. "I hope they're going to replace it as it gave some privacy as well as being beautiful. I'm so upset and angry. That tree swayed my decision about which flat I moved into." The local authority, which is a Labour stronghold, told Manchester Evening News workers made a mistake. Jamie Hodgkinson, councillor for the area, spoke to the authority after residents complained. "It's a shame," Cllr Hodgkinson said. "We try to get trees cut that do need cutting down, which takes forever, and then they go and chop the wrong one down. I've asked for them to get it replaced as soon as possible, like for like." The tree, believed to have been a cherry blossom, will now be replaced. A council spokesperson added: "We apologise unreservedly to local residents affected by this, it is clear that an error has been made on this occasion. "We have launched an urgent investigation to establish the circumstances as to how this has happened. The importance of trees and tree-planting feature prominently in all of our environmental campaigns and projects - including our target of planting one million trees across the borough by 2030."
