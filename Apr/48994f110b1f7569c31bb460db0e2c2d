The Prime Minister's video message, published on social media, insisted the Russian president's massive arsenal "will never break the spirit of Ukraine's people or conquer their home". He pledged that the UK "will not waver" in its support. In the two-and-a-half minute clip, Mr Johnson says: "From the moment the Russian invasion began, Ukrainians have defended their homeland with invincible courage. "We, in Britain, are lost in admiration for their valour and patriotism. Our job is to do everything we can to support them. Strengthen "Back in 2015, we sent a military mission called Operation Orbital to strengthen Ukraine's armed forces. "And by the time Vladimir Putin launched his latest onslaught, Britain had trained over 22,000 Ukrainian soldiers. "In January, we sent 2,000 anti-tank missiles. And we've kept up the supply, dispatching thousands of weapons." Mr Johnson added: "Just as important is humanitarian and economic aid. Britain is providing Â£400million of support including 500 mobile generators designed to allow hospitals and other essential facilities to keep going." "I've not the slightest doubt that when this time of agony is over, Ukraine will rise again and take her place once more among free and sovereign nations."
