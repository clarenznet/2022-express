Lucy Davis, 49, is known for starring in the BBC comedy The Office as Dawn Tinsley. However, the actress looked worlds away from her most iconic character when she took to Instagram to show off her trim physique and the intense workout routine her brother Jake has put her through in Los Angeles, USA. Lucy shared her transformation in view of her 794,000 followers, where she can be seen lifting a very large weight. She captioned the post: "55lb single arm deadlifts. I can’t get up from my chair. Send help #weightlifting #strengthtraining #womenlifting @jakebodyupgrade." Many social media users took to the post's comments to compliment the actress on her dramatic weight loss. Gdsouza0301 said: "You really did it. You're really inspiring a lot of people, myself included." Deannagillespie added: "Wow! Well done! I’m just getting into weightlifting. I'm good but not that good!" Sartorialactor commented: "You look utterly amazing... send some of that this way!!! Well done!!" The actress made a name for herself as Dawn Tinsley in Ricky Gervais' The Office, and she has since gone on to appear in The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina as one of the lead's aunts Hilda Spellman. She also played Etta Candy in the 2017 Wonder Woman movie, and has recently been filming US comedy series Amy from Amarillo.
