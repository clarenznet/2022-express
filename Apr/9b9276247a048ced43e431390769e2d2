Prince Harry has opened up about the difference between the UK and USA when it comes to mental health stigma and going to therapy. Speaking to BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux on Reid Hoffman's Masters of Scale podcast, Mr Hoffman said: "As a born and raised Californian myself, we would tell jokes. 'Hey, my therapist will talk to your therapist,' as a way of building a connection." The Duke of Sussex agreed with him, adding the same sort of jibe would never land back home in the UK. He said: "You're absolutely right, Reid, about the cultural differences, they're immense. You talk about it here in California, 'I'll get my therapist to call your therapist.' "Whereas in the UK it's like, 'Therapist? What therapist? Whose therapist? I don't have a therapist. No, I definitely don't, I've never spoken to a therapist.'” The Duke has placed himself at the forefront of mental health activism since stepping down from the Royal Family in 2020 but the cause is something he has long been involved in publicising. Fans of the duke and his wife Meghan Markle have said Prince Harry seems happier and more relaxed since his move to the USA, where he is clearly finding common ground with the American people - whereas some of the critics have claimed the Duke is merely pandering to his wife’s wishes to live anywhere but the UK. So, do you think that despite his newfound love for the USA Prince Harry will still come back home to live in the UK? Would you welcome him if he decided the USA wasn’t for him?
