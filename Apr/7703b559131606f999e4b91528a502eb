She said she was “deeply touched” and hoped the saplings will “flourish and grow for many years to come”. The Queen’s Green Canopy initiative is now at its halfway point, with the planting season coming to a close.  Planting will start again in October until the end of the Jubilee year. The Countess of Wessex, 57, planted an elm tree with help from children from Grange Park Primary School in Telford, Shropshire, yesterday. The Queen and Prince Charles started the project by planting a copper beech tree at Balmoral last autumn. Bafta’s chief executive Amanda Berry will lead the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Royal Foundation. The Duke is the president of arts charity Bafta and has known Ms Berry for many years. Miss Berry, the 60-year-old chief executive since 2000, said: “I am very excited.” William and Kate said: “We are very much looking forward to working with Amanda and are thrilled she has chosen to join us at The Royal Foundation.” Initiatives include the Earthshot Prize and Kate’s Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood.
