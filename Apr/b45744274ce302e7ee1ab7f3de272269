Brexiteer and former Brexit Party MEP, Ben Habib, has said the Northern Ireland Protocol is due to "political weakness and ineptitude", in a brutal blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Mr Habib was responding to a tweet from The Bruges Group that said: "The Northern Ireland Protocol - negotiated while the Government had one hand tied behind its back by an anti-Brexit Parliament - is transitional, not sacrosanct." To which the Chairman of Brexit Watch replied: "It was indeed negotiated when government had one hand tied behind its back but signed after the tie was removed. There is no excuse for the Protocol other than political weakness and ineptitude. Huge constitutional self-harm." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
