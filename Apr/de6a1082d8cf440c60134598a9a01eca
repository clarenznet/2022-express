The Queen's diary has been greatly reduced recently, so the nation was delighted to see the Queen appear in person at Prince Philip's memorial service at Westminster Abbey last month. But it seems the Queen will not be returning to full public duties any time soon, as Prince Charles will be representing her today at the Royal Maundy Service, a key fixture in the monarch's calendar every year. The Queen hasn't missed a Royal Maundy Service since 1970, but it is understood she is experiencing mobility issues and is subsequently keeping her engagements virtual or closer to home at Windsor for the time being.  The Queen's eldest son has represented her at swathes of engagements in recent months, including the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and the Remembrance Sunday event at the Cenotaph last year. But abdication certainly doesn't seem to be on the cards for the Queen, as she reiterated the pledge she made on her 21st birthday on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee this year by expressing that her life "will always be devoted" to service. So do you think it's time for the Queen to enjoy a well-earned retirement and pass on the crown to Prince Charles and his wife Queen Camilla?
