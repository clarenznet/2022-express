On a Mrs Hinch fans Facebook group, cleaning enthusiast Vicky Clayton said while sharing a picture of Mr Muscle drain gel: "Can anyone help please! I’ve used this to unblock my sink and bath drains. It is now worse and when having a shower we have a bathtub full by the end." Another cleaning enthusiast, Rachel Kerry Nelson, recommended using "soap powder down the drains". She added: "After using sink drainers and a plunger I ended up in hospital with burns to my hands, please be careful if you are gonna use a plunger now with the sink drainer." Wendy Clough commented: "Honestly hate this stuff. Never did anything to unblock my sink in the kitchen. Waste of money. "I use soda crystals, white vinegar and boiling water. Works every time."
