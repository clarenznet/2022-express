The Daily Express was given a first look at the accommodation block that is expected to start taking people within months. Hope House will hold up to 100 migrants across 50 rooms, which each have two beds, a desk and a wardrobe. They will share bathrooms and be given three meals a day in a communal dining room. Overlooking the Kigali hills, the five story block has a luscious garden and many rooms have balconies. Migrants will be free to come and go as they please from the block on the outskirts of capital Kigali.  The accommodation is only intended to be temporary while migrants are processed, with successful asylum applicants given homes by the Rwandan government. Tourists using the hostel appeared to be unimpressed by the hostel when it was open for bookings in the past, scoring it an average 2.5 on Tripadvisor. One reviewer said it was on a nice street with a good view of the Kigali hills but the rooms are “so basic”.  The block is privately owned and the Rwandan government is still negotiating a deal to rent it out. It is expected to be the first of a number of blocks that will be used to house migrants while their applications are assessed.
