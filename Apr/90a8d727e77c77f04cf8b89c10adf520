The Duchess of Sussex, 40, joined Prince Harry, 37, at the opening of the Invictus Games in The Hague on Friday. Meghan’s appearance was her first outside the US since stepping back from Royal duties in 2020. Pictures from the event show Harry donning a smart navy blue suit with an open-collared white shirt. Meanwhile, Meghan wore a white outfit, with matching handbag and gold accessories. Royal expert Richard Eden noted the similarities between Meghan’s outfit and the Duchess of Cambridge’s on her recent tour of the Caribbean. He said: “Was the Duchess of Sussex inspired by the Duchess of Cambridge's white trouser suit worn on her recent visit to Jamaica?” When Kate and Prince William visited Andrew Holness, the Prime Minister of Jamaica in March, the Duchess wore a white blazer designed by Alexander McQueen. It was paired with matching trousers and a £249 orange blouse from Ridley London. Kate also carried an orange vintage clutch from Willow Hilson Vintage, a Cheltenham-based boutique.
