The Extinction Rebellion group said more than 60 activists went to Lloyd's at around 7am with the aim of closing business for the day. But the market remained open through remote trading, a Lloyd's official said. XR said it wants an end to insuring projects involving fossil fuels, such as "coal, oil and gas". Protesters scaled the outside and dropped a banner that read: "End fossil fuels now." Activists are also said to have glued themselves to a fire exit. Others dressed as cleaners for the day. A Lloyd's spokesman said: "In the interests of safety, we advised corporation employees and market participants not to come to the building. "The market remains open and trading is continuing online using our remote capabilities." City of London Police said the protesters "moved on" around lunchtime yesterday.There were no arrests.
