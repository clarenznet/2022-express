He received a raucous reception at Augusta after almost losing a leg in a February 2021 car crash. Spectators had arrived in the early hours to get a front-row seat and the 15-times golf major champion did not disappoint as he parred the first hole. It was the first time he had competed in 508 days.  The 46-year-old sent his opening tee just shy of the fairway bunker. His approach shot trickled off the front of the green. The golf legend then chipped to 10 feet before saving par. If the star wins, he would become the oldest Masters champion, beating by three weeks 18-times major winner Jack Nicklaus. Briton Rory McIlroy needs to win this week to get a career grand slam. The defending champ is Japan's Hideki Matsuyama.
