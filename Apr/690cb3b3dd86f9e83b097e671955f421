Dotty was taken into care of the RSPCA’s Ashley Heath Animal Centre in Dorset in July 2021. The eight-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross, who was underweight and suffering from a skin condition, had been kept in a locked bedroom. Staff spent months treating her health problems before she was put up for adoption. But six months later, poor Dotty has not received a single application. Animal care assistant Hollie Jones said: “We’ve had zero interest in Dotty and it’s devastating. “She’s such a sweet girl but because she’s led such a restricted and withdrawn life she needs really patient owners who can help her get used to the big wide world.” Dotty, who adores people, is looking for a home where she will be the only pet. She has been trained to wear a muzzle when she is out and about as she can be reactive. She enjoys going for walks in quiet places and would love a garden. Ms Jones said: “Other dogs are particularly difficult for her but we’ve had her on a strict training plan and her behaviour has improved hugely in that time.
