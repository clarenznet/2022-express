The Prime Minister is set to use the Queen's Speech to pick a Brexit fight with the European Union over the hated deal after renegotiations stagnated. Mr Johnson and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have in principle signed off plans to bring forward a Northern Ireland Bill early in the next parliamentary session, which begins next month. That bill would give ministers the power to deactivate parts of the protocol in British law, including border checks across the Irish Sea. Speaking on LBC, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns refused to be drawn on the specifics of the Queen's speech but said: "What I would say is we have been clear as far back as last July, the prime minister said, that we believe that threshold for trial for triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol had been reached. There is significant societal disruption in Northern Ireland due to the way the protocol is being implemented. There is a sense that people in Northern Ireland are a people set apart."
