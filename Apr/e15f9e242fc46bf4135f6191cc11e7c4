The single-vehicle collision left the woman, who was travelling with a baby, with minor injuries, Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed. She was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro as a precaution. The accident happened just outside Bodmin, near the Glynn Valley Crematorium, shortly before 11am on Wednesday, April 6. Firefighters, ambulance crews and police attended the scene following reports a car had left the road and collided with bushes and trees. A photo from the scene of the incident appears to show seven emergency responders attempting to free the driver, who is believed to be from the local area, from the car. The road was cleared around 12pm. A fire service spokesman said: "One fire appliance and rescue tender from Bodmin Community Fire Station attended the incident and along with police and paramedics at the scene helped cut the driver free."
