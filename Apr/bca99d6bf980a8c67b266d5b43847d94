The Prime Minister said relations with Warsaw were intensifying during talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda. He said the meeting in Downing Street was an important opportunity to launch a "proper thoroughgoing security, defence partnership". He added: "We already do a lot together on this but there is much, much more that we can do and we have to discuss that in the days and weeks ahead." "But for the immediate future, the UK and Poland will work together to try to alleviate the suffering in Ukraine in any way that we can. I think we're now sending another Â£30million to support Poland." "There are NHS ambulances being driven by Polish drivers to help give vital medical relief and support." He added: "I think our partnership is intensifying anyway, but it is the intensification of the horror of what Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine that makes it all the more vital that we deepen and strengthen our ties today." Poland has called for more financial support from the UK for the 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees it has taken in. President Duda thanked the UK for its support of Polish people and said it left his country better able to help Ukrainians fleeing war.
