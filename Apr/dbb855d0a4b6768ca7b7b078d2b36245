Gary McGann, 54, "lost it" during an altercation with another man and, armed with a spanner, threw the man to the floor of the tower block's lobby. A court heard Kieron Ankers, 24, and Mickie Wilson, 22, arrived with knives and a shocking mass brawl involving the four men ensued. McGann punched his neighbour several times during the 20-minute fracas, which only ended after police arrived as CCTV security operators had spotted the behaviour on camera. But McGann, Ankers and Wilson were all spared jail yesterday at Minshull Street Crown Court despite admitting affray. McGann and Ankers were both sentenced to five months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and Wilson's 14-month jail sentence was suspended for 18 months. He also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving in relation to a separate incident, reports Manchester Evening News. Speaking about McGann, Judge Bernadette Baxter said: "He is old enough to know better isn't he?" The neighbour and other men present weren't charged, Minshull Street Crown Court was told.  The brawl happened on January 14 last year at the tower block in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, following ongoing, unexplained animosity between McGann and the neighbour. There was no evidence the knives were used in the fight, prosecutors said. But it became violent after Wilson, of Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, and Ankers, from Salford, Greater Manchester, arrived. McGann had claimed in court that the man had attacked him first. Mark Fireman, defending, said the other man initially had the spanner and McGann had wrestled it from him. Barristers for Ankers and Wilson said they acted "impulsively" and "inadvisably". The judge said: "While it may be the case that no members of the public were around because it was the early hours of the morning, people living there are entitled to come and go from that block of flats in peace, whatever time they choose." The three defendants were also ordered to complete rehabilitation activity requirement days.
