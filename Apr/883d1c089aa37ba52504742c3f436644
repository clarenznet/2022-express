Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and her husband Prince Harry returned to the UK, for the first time since 2020 and stunned fans with their outings. The Sussexes, in the words of their spokesperson, "stopped by the UK" to see "the Duke's grandmother." They followed this with a trip to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games. Royal columnist Daniela Elser has said that "the couple's full-throttle return to the limelight" is "the shape of things to come" which is "a disaster" for the house of Windsor. She explains that the Cambridge's attendance at the Easter Sunday service was overshadowed by the Sussex's "return to the limelight". She continued: "What seems increasingly clear is that the Cambridges' programme of good works cannot compete." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
