No matter what has happened in the past, a mother will, and should, stand by her child ('Discretion, we know, is better part of valour', March 31). It’s time to put this Epstein issue away for good. There has been much discussion recently on the relevance of the Commonwealth, such as Ann Widdecombe’s comments on the Cambridges’ visit to Jamaica (“Don’t just hand it over, William”, March 30), says Roger Smithies from Redditch, Worcs. If the Commonwealth was so bad, why do so many former colonies remain in it? I’m sure there must be millions like me who are astonished, and even sickened, at the amount of airtime and column inches that have been devoted to an Oscar spat between two showbiz luvvies (“Smith set to learn if he loses Oscar”, March 30), says Robert Readman from Bournemouth, Dorset. I think those in the audience who described it as a traumatic experience really do need to get a life. Trauma is what the population of Ukraine and the millions fleeing the war there have been going through for the last month. With reference to Her Majesty’s mobility difficulties now she is getting so frail, I think a mobility scooter would be ideal, says Sue Bailey from St Albans. I can just see her driving a gold one with a huge Union Jack across the front. I can understand her reticence to use a wheelchair but the memorial service for her husband would have been so much more comfortable for her if she had used a scooter. Something similar to the buggy she is using at Windsor would enable her to walk the dogs and attend meetings without discomfort. With everything going on in the world, all Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer can come up with to try and attack the Prime Minister is Covid parties dating back up to two years. Pathetic (“PM scorns call to quit”, March 31), says Glen Birkwood from Staines, Middlesex.
