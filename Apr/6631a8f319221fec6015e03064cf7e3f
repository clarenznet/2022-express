Vehicles such as the Mastiff, a protected patrol vehicle and the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, will likely be provided by the British government to help Ukrainian forces push closer to Russian lines. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles will also be announced within days. The move follows in the footsteps of The Czech Republic which sent tanks to Ukraine on Wednesday — the first NATO member to do so. All of the aid to Ukraine could "break" Putin's army. A senior government source told The Times: “The next three weeks will be critical.

Possibly. Depends on what help we can all give.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
