Victoria Beckham, 48, was the epitome of glamour as she embraced her slender curves in a black dress. The gown, from her eponymous brand, featured an asymmetrical design and figure-hugging materials. The singer-turner designer posed effortlessly in front of a mirror with one hand resting over her thigh, while the other held up her phone as she took the picture. In one of the snaps, Victoria could be seen looking away from the camera, while in the other picture the top half of her head was visible over the phone as she looked in the mirror. She opted for a natural-look makeup that complemented her shoulder-length loose caramel tresses. The Instagram post, which was shared with Victoria’s 29.9 million followers, soon gathered an array of comments from fans praising the former Spice Girls star. In the caption, Victoria boasted that her dress’ design “cinches you in in all the right places". Nabeela82 commented: “But do you even need to?
