The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in 46 per cent of cases it reviewed, people received "unsuitable" advice to transfer out of the British Steel Pension Fund. The scheme will cover people who transferred out of the fund between May 26, 2016 and March 29, 2018. The FCA expects it to be in place by early 2023, with people starting to receive compensation later in the year. Sheldon Mills, executive director for consumers and competition at the FCA, said victims should make a complaint now. He added: "The circumstances around British Steel Pension Scheme transfers were exceptional, with former members receiving significantly higher levels of unsuitable advice compared with other cases." The FCA will publish compensation scheme rules setting out how financial advisers must determine whether the advice they gave British Steel scheme members was unsuitable and pay redress as a result. Checks and monitoring will be carried out to ensure compliance. It added that it will take "strong action" against financial advisers that try to duck paying compensation to people. Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the scandal had "damaged the retirement prospects of so many people" and that the FCA's proposals would help more people get justice. She added: "This will cover many people who either don't know they have a claim or have yet to file one." The FCA is investigating 30 individuals or businesses related to the British Steel Pension Scheme and has an asset freeze in place on one financial advisory group. Matthew Connell, the Personal Finance Society's director of policy and public affairs, said: "That this is only the second time the FCA has used its powers to launch a compensation scheme reflects the fact it concluded too many British Steel workers were wrongly advised to give up a guaranteed income for life."
