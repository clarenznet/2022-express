Kate, 40, and Prince William, 39, attended the memorial service to Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey this week. The couple brought their two eldest children, Prince George, eight, and Princess Charlotte, six along. Their other child, Prince Louis, three, did not attend the service to remember his great-grandfather, who passed away last April aged 99. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s decision to bring their children to the service is a sign of their preparation for the royal duties that lie ahead of them, especially George, as the future King. “Well, it sounds awfully clinical, but that was never going to happen for William and Kate. “Because the year following their wedding was the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. “Nothing could detract from the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. “Talk about impeccable timing. In December 2012, they suddenly announced Kate's pregnant.” The Cambridges tied the knot in a huge ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 2011 watched by millions of people around the world. The Duchess once spoke about the tradition of posing for the cameras on the steps of the Lindo Wing. Kate has greeted photographers and well-wishers after giving birth to all three of her children. However, she revealed she found the prospect “terrifying” as she spoke to Giovanna Fletcher, the host of the ‘Happy Mum, Happy Baby’ podcast in 2020. Asked what it was like knowing there was a crowd outside the hospital, she said: “Yeah, slightly terrifying, slightly terrifying, I’m not going to lie.” She added: “Everyone had been so supportive and both William and I were really conscious that this was something that everyone was excited about and, you know, we’re hugely grateful for the support that the public had shown us.” ‘William & Kate: Too Good To Be True’ is available on My5.
