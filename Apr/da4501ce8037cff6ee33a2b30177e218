The plane, flight number LS718 from Palma de Mallorca to Edinburgh, is due to land at 1.30pm. It issued the Squawk code after departing from Mallorca at 11.15am. The 7700 code indicates a "general emergency". It typically means an engineering issue with the aircraft. It is not yet known why the 7700 signal was transmitted. Earlier this month, another Jet 2 flight was forced to make an urgent landing after delcaring an emergency situation on one of its flights from Alicante to Edinburgh.   A Jet2 spokesman said that a customer onboard requires "medical assistance." Last week, a Scandinavian Airlines flight from Stockholm to Dublin was forced to land in Edinburgh after emitting an emergency "squawk". The plane emitted the emergency signal at 10.06am, according to Squawk Tracker via Twitter. The flight, which was due to arrive in Dublin at 11.10am, was forced to perform an abrupt diversion as a result of the emergency.  The same day, an RAF Hawk T.2 plane also emitted the emergency signal while flying over Wales. It is unclear what caused the emergency but according to Flightradar24 the jet was forced to land at 1.19pm after a total flight time of 24 minutes. Explaining the use of the 7700 signal, RAF Lossiemouth had previously said that the practice is "not uncommon". It explained that its use helps "ensure the safe recovery" of an aircraft. RAF Lossiemouth's official account posted to Twitter: "Setting a squawk of 7700 isn't uncommon in these situations and is simply a precaution. "The word 'emergency' can sometimes worry those who are unfamiliar with aviation, but these procedures ensure the safe recovery of any aircraft with problems in the air."
