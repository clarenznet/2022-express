Demi Rose, 27, is no stranger to catching the attention of her 19.3million Instagram followers, as she often puts her eye-popping assets on full display. The model treated her legion of fans in her latest ensemble as she almost spilled out of a sheer lace corset. Her choice of outfit struggled to contain her ample assets in the eye-popping see-through bodice. The beauty has been enjoying herself as she soaked up the California sunshine at Coachella Festival 2022. Demi ensured her cleavage took centre-stage as she posed for a stunning photo uploaded to her Instagram stories. She sported a lace bustier giving a glimpse of her flesh in the sheer number. Demi paired the look with a long white floaty skirt which gave her look a more casual appearance. She showed off her beauty in the close-up shot with her facial features highlighted with blusher and bronze gloss. Her luscious blonde locks cascaded down past her shoulders as she held her arm away from her to take the shot.
