Britney Spears, 40, sparked a social media frenzy as the singer put her assets on display as the singer stripped off in her recent holiday photos. The Toxic singer snuggled up to her assistant Vicky T in the candid pictures.  The duo pouted in the sun-soaked photos as Britney decided to forego her swimsuit. The Womaniser hitmaker sported sunglasses with her blonde tresses swept up in a messy bun. While her colleague opted for a two-piece bikini, Britney admittedly chose to not wear anything as she posed with her legs wrapped around Vicky T. In another snap, the singer could be seen planting a kiss on her assistants cheek. In view of her 40 million followers, she captioned the post: "Yep... me naked in the pool and my assistant @vickyt holding me like a baby!!!! BAHAHAHAHA," followed by a series of emojis. The candid snaps received over 200,000 likes in a matter of minutes. Just hours earlier, Britney took to the picture-sharing site andÂ referenced Chris Isaaks hit Did a Bad, Bad Thing as she writhed around on the beach in a bikini. In the 60 second clip, the singer flashed her bottom as she kicked her legs on the beach. In another shot, she could be seen topless as she rested her head on the sand and used her hands to cover her cleavage area. The sultry clip racked up over two million likes and she was inundated with messages. Brina commented: "What living carefree looks like." Laisra advised: "Looking beautiful babe but where's your sunscreen?" Priscilla added: "Oops she did it again."
