To celebrate ten years of the prize draw, the high street bank will crown more winners in June, giving customers many more chances to win prizes between £100 and £100,000. While the draw is free to enter, there is a catch. It’s great news for savers as Halifax has announced some big changes to its Savers Prize Draw to celebrate its tenth anniversary this June. Rather than the usual three winners of the top £100,000 prize, Halifax will be awarding ten eligible customers £100,000. In addition, ten customers will also win £10,000. The usual draws of £1,000 (100 winners) and £100 (1,500 winners) will also take place.

Customers will also need to hold £5,000 or more for a whole calendar month - so, to be in with a chance to win in June - £5,000 must be in the account for the full calendar month of May. Participants will also need to be 18 or over and live in England, Wales or Scotland. All Halifax and Bank of Scotland savings accounts qualify, with the exception of children’s savings accounts.

Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: “Halifax has launched a new switching incentive of £125 for consumers who switch to either the Reward Current Account or Ultimate Reward Current Account." She continued: “The Reward Current Account may appeal to consumers looking for incentives as this account allows them to choose either a £5 net reward payment or a lifestyle benefit each month. “The account charges a £3 monthly fee, but this is waived for those who can credit the account with at least £1,500 per month. “Those keen to take advantage of the switcher cash will need to do so via the Current Account Switch Service before 9 May 2022. On balance, the account earns an Excellent Moneyfacts product rating.” What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea What does the Halifax account offer?
