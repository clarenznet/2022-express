Cristiano Ronaldo stole a share of the points for Manchester United against Chelsea at Old Trafford on a night that could have been much worse for the hosts. Chelsea dominated possession and could have been three up when Marcos Alonso volleyed home the opening goal on the hour mark. Ronaldo was picked out by Nemanja Matic two minutes later and he was clinical from close range. However, eight of Ronaldo's team-mates failed to show up on a big night under the lights. MAN UTD (4-2-3-1) David De Gea 7 A number of smart saves, the pick of them to keep out a Kai Havertz header from close range in the first half. Diego Dalot 5 Struggled to get near Chelsea's wide men and was nowhere to be seen when Marcos Alonso volleyed home at the back post. Victor Lindelof 5 Was caught deeper than the rest of his line on a number of occasions Raphael Varane 5 Failed to stamp his mark on the defence, which was constantly pulled apart by Chelsea's attacking movement.  Alex Telles 4 Reece James had more touches than any other player on the pitch and most of them came down Telles' side. James almost scored the winner but his effort crashed off the post. Scott McTominay 5 Struggled to break down Chelsea's attack as the visitors dominated possession. Nemanja Matic 6 Was found wanting in the first half but supplied Ronaldo with a clever pass for the equaliser. Anthony Elanga 5 Did not see much of the ball so was unable to create any attacking opportunities.  Bruno Fernandes 5 Far from his dazzling best and was frequently caught on the ball by N'Golo Kante. Marcus Rashford 5 Another tough evening for Rashford who was whisked off for birthday boy Juan Mata after 79 minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo 7 A brilliant first touch and finish to score the equaliser. Also produced a good save from Edouard Mendy late on. SUBS Phil Jones 6 (79, for Matic) Juan Mata 6 (79, for Rashford) Alejandro Ferreyra N/A (90+1, for Elanga)
