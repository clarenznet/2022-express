Alex Bone and Millie Barnham braved hazards including hay bale obstacles and water lobbed by spectators for 1,264ft to cross the line first. Male or female carriers were allowed and the "wife" could be any willing male or female adult. All "wives" had to weigh at least 50kg - just under 8st - with anyone lighter wearing a rucksack with tins of baked beans or other ballast to meet the rules. Alex and Millie also took home a barrel of local ale from the annual race in Dorking, Surrey. And they received Â£250 to help them get to July's World Wife Carrying Championships in Finland. A Pot Noodle and some dog food were awarded to the last-placed couple. Event organisers Trionium say wife-carrying has its roots in Viking marauders 12 centuries ago and went on for 300 years. The latest version, which began in 2008, brought the pastime back after nearly 900 years. It was held annually until Covid struck, with the last race in February 2020.
