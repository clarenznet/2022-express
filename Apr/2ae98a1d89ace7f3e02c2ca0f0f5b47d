  Pamela showed off her ageless beauty as she made her way down the streets of New York’s trendy theatre district. The star wore a shiny black gown that fanned out as she walked along the pavement. The dress featured a low neckline and a tie at the waist to show off the actress’ figure. The sleeves of the dress were made of a dark semi-sheer material, while her skirt parted a little at the front to show off her toned legs.  The star sported a pair of dark shades over her eyes. She had painted her lips and nails bright red for the occasion. She wore her blonde hair in elegant curls that stood out against the black fabric. Pamela finished off the look with a pair of pointed, black stiletto heels with black ties around each ankle. The star was snapped en route to the Ambassador Theatre, where she had made her debut in the lead role of Roxie Hart two days earlier.
