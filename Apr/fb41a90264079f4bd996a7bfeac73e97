We followed and respected all the Covid rules and were not allowed to see him, although I did a 40-plus mile round trip every other day to collect his washing. He died alone, probably terrified aged 65. There are no words. But the man who set the rules while we went through this was partying. Incredible. Indefensible. The Daily Express could not have said it any better, says Graham Loney, from York. Narrow-minded keyboard warriors or sections of the media will not determine who leads the country and MPs seem disinclined to move on a vote of no confidence. While Boris Johnson focuses on Ukraine, the economy, trade deals and immigration, Labour repeatedly bangs on about Partygate because it has nothing to offer on the big issues of the day. How can making shopping dearer, for those who increasingly want to buy goods online, benefit retailers, says Angela Couling, from Ashford, Kent. Online gives you a wealth of choice at acceptable prices, no problems with parking or getting public transport, no crowds and shopping at any time of the day. Why not insist greedy councils reduce their business rates? Retailers also need to re-evaluate their goods and services. People defending the actions of the eco-activists say top scientists are warning of runaway global warming but so-called experts have been making fools of themselves for years, says Dr Peter Outen, from Brentwood, Essex. With warm temperatures they predict that the icecaps will melt and the earth will be engulfed in floodwaters. Then when it cools they say we're heading for a new Ice Age.
