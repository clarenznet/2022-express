Michelle Dockery, 40, dazzled at the Downton Abbey premiere in a sparkling silver gown. The gown glistened as she strutted the red carpet along with a matching cape. Michelle's dress featured a hemmed waistline as the dazzling design changed, drawing in the actress' petite waist. The on-screen star styled her signature brunette tresses in a light wave, as well as showing off her striking features with a red lip. She went for a simple makeup look with black eyeliner, in order not to take attention away from her dress. Michelle opted for a red manicure, matching her bright red lip and accessorised her outfit with a pair of red earrings and several layered gold rings. Others stunning at the premiere included newcomer, Laura Haddock, who looked amazing in a sheer silver gown featuring feathered detailing and a cape. Meanwhile, Laura Carmichael cut a glamorous figure in an elegant one-shoulder gown with bow detailing and a large train. The new film will see the Crawley family head to the South of France to uncover a mystery at a villa bestowed to Dowager Countess of Grantham, Violet Crawley. This happens while an ambitious director plans to make a film at Downton.
