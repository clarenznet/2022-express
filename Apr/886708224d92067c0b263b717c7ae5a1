Angelina Jolie surprised locals in the city of Lviv, Ukraine, as she made an unannounced appearance at a cafe. The 46-year-old actress was spotted by a shocked onlooker, who shared a video of her on Facebook. Maya Pidhorodetska wrote of the unexpected encounter: “Nothing special. Just Lviv. “I just went to have coffee. Just Angelina Jolie.” The local woman concluded: “Ukraine is simply supported by the whole world.” In the clip, Angelina could be seen smiling and waving at the camera as she entered the eatery in a grey jumper and matching wide leg trousers. The Hollywood star and humanitarian carried a backpack with her, while keeping her look casual with a low bun and makeup-free face. It comes as Russian forces started a renewed assault in the east of the country.
