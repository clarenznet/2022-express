You might have learned French, Spanish or German at school, but few of us in the UK will have learned much of the Ukrainian language. If you have signed up to host a family, this could prove to be a major barrier to communication if the person living with you doesn't speak much English. While they are eligible for free English language classes, you might want to make an effort to try and communicate with your new housemate in their native tongue. From learning how to say hello and goodbye, or please and thank you, to making sure they are okay, this can be a huge help. We have compiled some phrases you might need to know below, or you can find this very handy guide from Duolingo here.
