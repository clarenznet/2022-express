The gang's mastermind David Austin killed himself in 2019 after being invited for a police interview under caution, the court was told. Alan Barratt, 62, and Susan Dalton, 66, helped Austin entice savers by promising unrealistic returns and cash bonuses. They got them to transfer pensions out of legitimate funds. Judge Gregory Perrins said the pair caused "such misery to so many", with victims suffering mental problems and attempting suicide. Barratt, of Althorne, Essex, and Dalton, of Rochdale, Lancashire, admitted one count each of fraud at Southwark Crown Court. Yesterday Barratt got five years and seven months while Dalton was jailed for four years and eight months.
