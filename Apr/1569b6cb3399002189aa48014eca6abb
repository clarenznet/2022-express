DUP MP Sammy Wilson claims that some aspects of the UK’s deal to leave the EU - particularly the Northern Ireland Protocol - means we’re still not free from the bloc’s grips. He told Express.co.uk that the Tories had “committed themselves to taking VAT off energy bills once we left the EU", as the Prime Minister had previously made it clear they couldn’t cut VAT because “we’re part of the EU and EU laws on VAT don’t allow us to do it.” But Mr Wilson said the protocol has now stopped Chancellor Rishi Sunak from being able to effectively tackle the soaring cost of living crisis. The Northern Irish MP said: “When they considered that for the whole United Kingdom, they found they couldn't apply it to Northern Ireland because we are still under the VAT regime. So it was dropped for the whole United Kingdom.” He added a review was needed to maximise the UK’s “Brexit freedoms”. But what do you think, is EU red tape still holding Britain back?
