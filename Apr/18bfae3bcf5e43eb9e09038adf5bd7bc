But after becoming the secretary of German industrialist Oskar Schindler during the Second World War, Reinhard typed up a list of 1,200 Jews to be spared during the Holocaust that included her name. Mimi survived death in the Plasz贸w concentration camp in Krak贸w, Germanoccupied Poland, on account of her shorthand and her fluency in German. And her role in helping Oskar, who bribed Nazi officials to keep the people as factory workers, was told in the 1993 Academy-Award-winning film Schindler's List. She was born Carmen Koppel in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, the daughter of grain merchant Emil and his wife Freda. She disliked her first name, picked by operaloving parents, but chose the nickname "Mimi" her father called her. Mimi studied at the University of Vienna, where she met her future husband Jozef "Yozsi" Weitman.  When war broke out in 1939, they were running a fabric factory in Krak贸w and had a son, Sacha, who they smuggled out of Poland into Hungary. Weitman was shot dead in the city's Jewish ghetto and Reinhard was moved to Plasz贸w after the Nazis shut it down. After the war, she reunited with her son and moved to Morocco where she met her second husband, Albert Reinhard. They moved to New York and had a daughter, Lucienne, who died when she was 49. Mimi emigrated to Israel in 2007 to be near to her son and passed away in a retirement home.  Mimi Reinhardt born January 15, 1915, died April 8, 2022, aged 107
