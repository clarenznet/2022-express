The huge Airbus A400M Atlas transport aircraft could be heard by residents in Glasgow, Scotland, as it performed what appeared to be various take-off and landing manoeuvres. The plane popped up on flight-tracking service Flightradar24 as it flew repeated loops above the north and south of the River Clyde before descending to an altitude of around 600 feet (or less) at Glasgow Airport and then taking off again. The turboprop military plane was tracked as it flew up to Glasgow from its base at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, before entering the airspace above the Glasgow area around 10.35pm. It then returned south of the border around 35 minutes later at 11.10pm, Glasgow Live reports. Plenty of residents took to Twitter to share news of the plane's presence, with one tweeting: "Big A400 doing low level flying about Glasgow tonight. Flight from Brize Norton." Others told of their panic and seemed to have had their sleep disrupted by the flight, as one posted: "Fuel crisis? Then why have the RAF got planes doing laps round Glasgow at this time", along with a sleep emoji. A third quizzed: "Anyone got an idea why this RAF flight from Brize Norton is circling Glasgow Airport, dropping down to a few hundred feet, but not landing?", with a fellow Twitter user responding with "Training apparently." A fellow bemused resident wrote: "RAF plane circling Glasgow, keeps dropping to just above the airport then climbs and does another loop. Weird!" The RAF Airbus A400M Atlas, which costs in the region of €150 million per unit, operates as a tactical airlifter to deliver supplies or personnel. It has the ability to carry a 37-tonne payload more than 2,000 nautical miles to established and remote civilian and military airfields, including Brize Norton.
