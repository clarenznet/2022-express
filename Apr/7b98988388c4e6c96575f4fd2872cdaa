Rod Stewart and his model wife Penny Lancaster put on a loved-up display last night following an evening out in Mayfair. The Maggie May hitmaker, 77, and his wife, 51 looked closer than ever as they headed home after their night out at the exclusive, members-only club Oswald's in the centre of the capital. Making their way out of the exclusive club, Penny stunned in a fitted black suit. She put her own twist on the outfit by pairing it with a leopard print shirt and sky-scraper black heels. Despite her late night out, the mother-of-two looked fresh-faced with glowing make-up and a nude lip. The Loose Women star guest panellist wore her blonde locks in its usual sleek style as she headed home after the evening's events.

The Do Ya Think I'm Sexy star added a white shirt with a spotted navy tie which had come undone by the end of the night. Sitting in their ride home, Penny playfully grabbed her beau's face before planting a kiss on his lips. The pair were all smiles as they laughed in the back of the car before being driven home.
