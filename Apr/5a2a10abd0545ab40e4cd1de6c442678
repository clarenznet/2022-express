Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s marriage might be in trouble after the actor’s controversial actions at the Oscars, according to reports. It has been alleged that if the couple were to split, they could be facing “one of the ugliest divorces in showbiz history”. Jada recently shared a rare insight into how the family have been dealing with the fallout from The Oscars. This comes as tensions have reportedly grown between Men In Black actor Will and his wife Jada following the chaotic events of the Oscars last month. Will shocked the world when he walked across the stage to slap Chris Rock live on television after the comedian made a joke about his wife. Cameras caught Will seemingly laughing at the joke about his wife’s shaved head, due to her alopecia diagnosis, before quickly changing his behaviour after seeing Jada’s expression. While Will has since apologised to both the Academy and Chris for his extremely public outburst, reports claim the incident has put a strain on their marriage.      An insider claimed: “Ever since the Oscars scandal, tensions between them have been palpable. “There have been problems for years, but they're barely speaking right now. “If they were to split, Will has a fortune of $350million that Jada would be entitled to half of under California law. “It could be one of the ugliest divorces in showbiz history and drag on longer than Angelina's and Brad's did.”     Actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been separated for years but their divorce has yet to be finalised, despite Angelina filing all the way back in September 2016. Will and Jada, who are also actors with huge salaries and multiple children, could reportedly face the same sort of lengthy legal affair if they did choose to split. “Will obviously doesn't want that, but there is only so much he can take,” the source told Heat Magazine. Express.co.uk have contacted Will and Jada’s reps for comment. READ MORE...

He told CBS Sunday Morning in March this year: “There's never been infidelity in our marriage. Jada and I talk about everything, and we have never surprised one another with anything ever.” The couple’s relationship has hit headlines in recent years after Jada opened up about it on her Red Table Talk Facebook Watch series, telling viewers: “Four and a half years ago... I started a friendship with August. We actually became really, really good friends. It all started with him just needing some help, me wanting to help his health, his mental state. “From there as time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement with August,' she explained, later clarifying, "It was a relationship, absolutely". Will and Jada also clarified on Red Table Talk, in a joint conversation, that they were separated when the relationship took place.      It wasn’t until the next day, however, that he apologised to Chris. He issued a written statement, which read: “Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behaviour at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. “Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. “I would like to publicly apologise to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. “I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness. “I would also like to apologise to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees and everyone watching around the world,” he added.
