The embarrassing gaffe comes as Russian FSB intelligence officers appear to have staged an arrest of a group of suspected Nazis plotting to kill journalists loyal to the Kremlin.Experts analysing the video point out that a note left by the apparent assailants appear to show the words “signature unclear” in a literal application of likely instructions given to the writer. Putin announced an FSB operation had exposed a plan by the group, who were allegedly backed by the West to assassinate one of Russia’s most famous TV hosts because he put it: “The West faced an information fiasco in Russia.”In footage released by the FSB, and broadcast on state TV, the operation appears to show how six members of a suspected fascist group, recruited by Ukraine’s own intelligence agency were due to kill Vladimir Soloyov as well as other Russian TV stars.However, the seven-minute video appears to be strewn with errors making the who piece appear to be a not so elaborate hoax.Images start by showing officers kicking in a door of the alleged suspects before violently detaining them in the process. Inside the venue, a range of neo-Nazi memorabilia can also be seen, ranging from Swastikas to a picture of Adolf Hitler on a desk.An automatic rifle can also be seen in the corner of the room.A note, written by hand, on a book of far-Right literature caught on camera said in Russian: “To Timokha, thank you for your support! Kill to live! Live to kill!”The hoax was made all the more apparent when the signature was spotted to say: “Signature Unclear” in what appears to have been an instruction by the producers of the video to be taken literally by the props team.

Elliot Higgins, the head of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, tweeted: “I genuinely believe this is a dumb FSB officer being told to get three Sims.”Ukraine’s security agency SBU said it had no plans to target the TV host.
