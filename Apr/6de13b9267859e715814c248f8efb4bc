If you have diabetes, having too much glucose (sugar) in your blood for a long time can cause some serious complications, including foot problems which may lead to amputation if caution is not adhered. Some of the most acute warning signs of blood sugar damage can be obscured in relation to the nerves. Nerve damage caused by high blood sugar levels is medically referred to as diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy most often damages nerves in your legs and feet; another telltale sign of which can be observed on your toes. According to WebMD, Tips to reduce diabetes foot problems include: Your foot check is part of your annual review, which means you should have it as part of your diabetes care and it's free on the NHS. "This is because you’re more likely to have serious foot problems and these can lead to amputations," explains Diabetes UK. According to the health body, if you develop a problem with your feet, it's really important to speak to your care team right away - don't delay. In most cases, serious foot problems can be prevented. As Diabetes UK noted, you can do this by checking your feet yourself every day, and having a foot check at least once a year that’s arranged by your GP practice. "Everyone with diabetes should have an annual foot check, so make sure you get yours – even if you’ve been referred to a foot specialist or clinic," explains the health body. "They will check your feet but also tell you your level of risk of foot problems."
