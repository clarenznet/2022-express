And so it is with Boris Johnson's proposal to build up to seven nuclear power stations. Where to start? Three facts: Nuclear is the most expensive way to make energy that we have ever devised. It's the most polluting by far, producing waste that remains deadly for thousands of years. The bill for cleaning up the nukes we have is more than Â£100billion and just keeps going up. Nuclear is also the slowest way we know to make energy, taking typically 10 years to plan and 10 more years to build. Nuclear projects always come in late and above budget. Hinkley Point is a decade late now and billions over budget. Most expensive, most polluting and by far the slowest - that's nuclear. In stark contrast new wind and sun energy projects take between one and two years to build. They are by far the cheapest way to make energy and getting cheaper. And, of course, there's no toxic waste. The fastest, cheapest, cleanest and safest way to beat this energy crisis, to nail down energy bills forever - and beat the climate crisis for good measure - is to invest in more wind and sun energy. With the budget for just one big nuclear power station, we could be at 100 per cent green on the grid - powered by our own wind and sun - in 10 years from now, just as the first diggers might be turning up to start work on the first of these foolish new nuclear projects.
