Glamorous Rihanna Fenty is often said to have invented the showbiz trend for wearing lingerie outdoors, but she upped her game even more than usual in her satin outfit, intentionally left open to reveal a glimpse of her baby bump. The sensational star, who has just weeks to go before the arrival of her first baby, paired the outfit with a pair of pink gingham shorts. The chart-topper accessorised the look with silver sparkly trainers and an equally sparkly miniature handbag by Balenciaga to match. The heavily pregnant star has taken to wearing navel-flashing outfits a lot recently as she proudly displays her swollen belly in the lead-up to the birth. However this one was deliberately kept loose for added comfort. The outing, to a LA restaurant with partner A$AP Rocky, comes after announcements that she made the latest Forbes billionaire list. Her wealth is now estimated at $1.7 billion, making the Barbados-born beauty the first ever billionaire to hail from the island.
