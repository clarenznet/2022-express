Slivnik, a labrador cross who is around six years old, was rescued in North Macedonia when she was a puppy. But she became "despondent and withdrawn" after spending years stuck in a shelter in the country. Marija Stojanovski, who works at the shelter, asked non-profit organisation Viktor's PawPrints, which rehomes unwanted dogs from North Macedonia to the UK, to step in to try to find adopters for Slivnik and her best friend Angel, a five-year-old retriever cross who was also rescued as a stray. A spokesperson for Viktor’s PawPrints said: "This pair of sweet bonded girls have been in this shelter for most of their lives. "Sweet and gentle and desperate to get out. "All they have ever known is this pen. "They were rescued at an early age and then forgotten about in this shelter until Marija took notice. "As more time passed, Slivnik started to become despondent and withdrawn. "Marija reported that she was no longer listening to her or even interacting with her. "She told us she feared time was running out for her, she was giving up."
