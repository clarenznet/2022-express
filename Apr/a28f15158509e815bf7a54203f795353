Boris Johnson has already received one fine over the party gate scandal and, while Downing Street insist no further fines have been issued to the Prime Minister, more could follow as police are looking into a further five incidents. The scandal has sparked fury across the UK, with many voters angry with the PM for taking part in the gatherings at a time when people could not leave their homes - or be outside the place they lived - without a reasonable excuse. And it seems the furore could hit the Conservatives where it will hurt most: the ballot box. Prominent backbencher Steve Baker warned the scandal could derail the Toriesâ€™ chances of local election victory, saying voters were repeatedly mentioning Partygate on the campaign trail. The Wycombe MP called for Mr Johnson to resign earlier this week, joining a handful of colleagues who have publicly condemned the Prime Minister - including Mark Harper who issued a no-confidence letter. According to the bookies, there are two key candidates who could replace the Prime Minister - Keir Starmer at 9/2, and Jeremy Hunt - who could be preparing to launch a leadership bid if the no-confidence vote reaches the threshold - at 13/2. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: "Keir Starmer may be leading the way in the betting to replace Boris as PM, but we've seen plenty of interest in Jeremy Hunt over the last few days, and his odds have been cut significantly as a result." So as Mr Johnson continues to be distracted by partygate, should he stand down and let a new leader take over? Who do you think would be best to deliver a better Brexit?
