They have come to buy a postage stamp, that depicts a Ukrainian soldier standing on a beach giving the finger to a Russian warship. It recalls an incident at the beginning of the war when a small garrison on Snake Island in the Black Sea refused to surrender to the guided-missile cruiser Moskva. "They've been standing there for hours," says an older man approvingly. The queue begins at the post office's main entrance, runs the length of the front of the building and into the distance along the side. "Everyone wants one," says a woman laughing." Alexander, a thirty-something man from Kyiv, appears near the entrance and is immediately surrounded by two or three men, eager to see his purchase. He bought a sheet of six for around 60 pence each and showed me them on his phone. "I wanted them for the memory. Maybe I will put one on an envelope and send it abroad," he said. "The new stamp picks up on a wave of public enthusiasm from the incident, when a Ukrainian serviceman was recorded telling the Russian warship, which sank last week, to "**** off". The crowd begins to disperse as the post office closes, but a small group remains, undaunted by the temporary setback. The stamps are being offered for sale on eBay for as much as Â£80 each.
