Residents were advised to stay indoors and not approach the area for safety, while the 'bomb squad' operated on the scene. The police had cordoned off the Eastbourne Road area of Brighton shortly after 8pm for about an hour on Monday evening until the suspected shell was removed. The incident was soon over and roads were reopened. The incident occurred very close to Coombe Road Primary School. Representatives of the Ministry of Defence were expected to arrive at the scene, The Argus reported. Roads in the area were closed both ways from Baden Road to Canfield Close for about an hour. A police spokesman said that the suspected mortar shell is thought to have been "innocently bought" by a member of the public. The Sussex Police warned citizens to expect disruptions in traffic.
