A video posted on social media appears to show the First Minister, who usually wears a tartan face covering, without a mask on a visit to a barber's in East Kilbride on Saturday. There was a legal requirement to wear one in most indoor public places in Scotland - including shops, public transport and hair salons - until it became guidance today. An SNP spokesman said: "The First Minister was invited into the barber's. Within a few seconds, she realised she hadn't put her mask back on and put it on."
