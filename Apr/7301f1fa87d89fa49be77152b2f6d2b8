Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 51, turned heads in a dazzling azure blue outfit today.  However, the low-cut neckline of the fashion-forward co-ord revealed a little too much, as Amanda flashed a glimpse of her underwear.  As she flaunted her toned legs while strolling down the street, the star’s nude bra could be seen due to her ab-baring jacket’s daringly plunging look.  Amanda didn’t let the wardrobe mishap get her down though, as she smiled for the cameras while showing off her sensational figure in the cropped blue blazer, which she paired with a matching thigh-split skirt.  The singer was on her way home from hosting her Heart FM Breakfast Show in London when she debuted her Spring-inspired ensemble.  Amanda accessorised with patent black leather heels and oversized sunglasses, alongside a studded clutch bag.  The BGT favourite completed her look with a gold necklace, while letting her blonde locks frame her face in loose waves.
