Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has been hailed as a "proper leader" after protecting Fabinho as the Brazilian midfielder waited to take his crucial penalty during the Reds' 2-0 win over Watford on Saturday afternoon. Fabinho netted his late spot-kick to seal the points after Diogo Jota's first-half header had put Jurgen Klopp's side in the ascendancy in the crunch Anfield clash. Liverpool locked horns with Watford knowing that they needed a positive result against the Hornets if they were to stand any chance of maintaining their bid to wrestle the Premier League crown away from Manchester City. And after a nervy start on Merseyside, Jota bagged another big goal to settle down an anxious Anfield crowd. But the game wasn't truly done until Fabinho coldly dispatched his spot-kick in the 89th minute, with the visitors looking a constant menace in and back-and-forth match. But with so much riding on one moment, Liverpool's skipper, Henderson, was taking no chances prior to Fabinho's big moment. With Watford still in the match, Ben Foster came out in a bid to try and get into the midfielder's head - only to find Henderson standing in the way.

This is why he's one of our key players.". Protecting penalty-takers has become a fascinating trend in recent weeks. Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta stepped up in a similar fashion for Kai Havertz before the German's match-winning penalty in the Club World Cup final against Palmeiras. Azpilicueta took the ball and soaked up all the pressure and mind-games before stepping aside for Havertz to etch his name into Blues' folklore once again.
