Supporters of Just Stop Oil thwarted M25 drivers from filling up at Cobham and Clacket Lane in Surrey by smashing pumps. Police said 35 people were arrested. Nathan McGovern, a 22-year-old student from Coventry, said: "I refuse to stand by as families in the UK are forced to choose between eating and heating." Justice Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted: "We will not allow militants to sabotage people's lives." Insulate Britain said 61 people would be in court today for earlier roadblocks.
