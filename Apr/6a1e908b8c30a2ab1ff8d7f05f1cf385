Hundreds of lorries were stuck in 18-mile tailbacks yesterday with the port in Kent gridlocked as people tried to head to the Continent for Easter breaks. The port has been under strain since P&O Ferries, which has three vessels in Dover, sacked 800 staff to bring in cheaper workers. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the firm is still not operating following "failed safety checks" on its new crews. She added: "The traffic disruption caused by P&O is very serious. Coupled with adverse weather and the Easter getaway traffic, the situation is severe. This can be expected to continue for the next few days." A Port of Dover spokesman said: "The main approach roads are very busy. We are working with operators to get people on their way as swiftly as possible but are asking passengers to allow extra time for their journey. "Local traffic is advised to use alternative routes where possible." In a bid to tackle the problem, Kent Police implemented a traffic management system aimed at easing congestion. However, it was said to have caused further delays and also clogged up alternative routes. National Highways last night stated: "There are delays of 60 minutes above normal travel time. Please allow extra time."
