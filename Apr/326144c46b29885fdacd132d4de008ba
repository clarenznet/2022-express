Temperatures in parts of England are expected to reach up to 23C (73F) today - making it hotter than Majorca, Ibiza and Malta. The warmest day so far in 2022 was March 23, when 20.8C (69F) was recorded in St James's Park, London. The sunshine means there are expected to be at least 4.6million leisure trips today with some 27.6 million car journeys over the whole of the Bank Holiday weekend. Chaos has already gripped airports and train stations with travellers left waiting in queues for hours yesterday. Passengers at Manchester and Birmingham airports posted pictures of long lines at check-in desks with Manchester customers reporting a 90-minute wait for their luggage. Dozens of British Airways and Easyjet flights to and from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled yesterday. Rail passengers have also been warned of delays as Network Rail carries out 530 engineering projects costing Â£83million. While many will be enjoying the sunny weather, those with hay fever will be feeling a little less than their best as the pollen count rises. According to the Met Office, all regions of England will have very high pollen counts today and tomorrow - making it a difficult few days for allergy sufferers. Pollen levels in Wales will also be very high for the rest of the week. And in Scotland, there will be medium counts in the South-west and South-east but low counts in the North and Highlands. Met Office meteorologist Richard Miles assured sufferers that the high-pressure conditions will keep winds fairly light, meaning pollen is less quickly dispersed. He added: "Most places will see above-average temperatures this weekend. "Places in the South-east might see 22C or even 23C today. "Tomorrow and Sunday will be a degree or two cooler everywhere, with the warmest temperatures most likely in western and central parts of England."
