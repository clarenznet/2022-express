Lady Gaga, 36, gave a stunning performance as part of the GRAMMY Awards ceremony on Sunday evening. The 64th Annual Grammy Awards took place in Las Vegas for the first time, although it is usually hosted in Los Angeles. Lady Gaga wore a mint green strapless dress with her blonde hair worn in a retro updo as she sang Love For Sale and Do I Love You. Lady Gaga and Tony Bennet won the GRAMMY Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. The Love for Sale album was released in September 2021. Tony, who introduced Lady Gaga in a pre-recorded message, retired from performing at the age of 95.
