Announcing his green plans, Boris Johnson said: “Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future.” The UK transport sector is currently the most polluting, being responsible for 27 percent of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. Second-hand cars will be unaffected by the ban, with petrol and diesel cars still being able to change hands on the used market after the cut off date in 2030. There are some 31.8 million cars on Britain’s roads, with roughly 18.8 million running on petrol, and around 12.3 million on diesel. Even as the planet suffers due to man made pollution and global warming, there are still plenty who don’t want to make the switch to electric vehicles for a variety of reasons. The Government has promised that by the time the ban rolls around, there will be £1.6 billion invested in green infrastructure to power EV vehicles from homes across the UK. But are you ready to give up your fuel powered car? Do you think the Government should have a say in what vehicles you can and can’t drive?
