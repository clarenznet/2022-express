Haas chief Guenther Steiner has fired back at Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff for branding his sides' links with Ferrari as 'job-hopping'.  The Silver Arrows chief has previously aired his frustrations at the American outfit for running the same engine, gearbox and suspension as the current Constructors' Championship leaders. Everything that Haas and Ferrari are doing is perfectly legal, despite their framework similarities. They also use Ferrari's wind tunnel and have an office in Maranello, just like the Prancing Horse. Wolff has not taken a liking to this, citing unfairness in the integrity of the sport. But Steiner has hit out at him, saying that nobody complained when Mercedes dominated the sport for the previous nine years. “There are sometimes things in the rules that if they don’t work for you, you cannot go and change it,” Steiner said to The Metro. “Mercedes was winning the World Championship eight years in a row, they had a very strong engine, and good for them, they did a good job. But nobody said: “Oh, we now need to change the engine rule, because Mercedes is winning everything. “There is governance in place. And if certain people think they can change everything by just speaking, I don’t think that is going to happen.” Steiner's comments come after Wolff complained about the current system, with Mercedes currently 39 points behind Ferrari in the current season after just three races. “I think it needs reform,” Wolff previously said. We want to avoid these kinds of discussions that we have now, the polemic around the last few days or last few weeks.  “Everybody deserves to perform well, and people should get credit when they’ve done a good job. But some of the job-hopping or entity-hopping on the same premises is just creating arguments that are not necessary for the sport.” The pair will face off in the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix on Sunday, with practice set to start on Friday afternoon.
