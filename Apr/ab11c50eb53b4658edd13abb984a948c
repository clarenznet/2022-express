The war has impacted supplies, with the rising price of fuel making it expensive not just to catch fish but also to freeze and process it. Fishing fleets are finding it increasingly hard to break even or justify trading at all. Industry analysts Mintec found that since last December, Scottish salmon has jumped by 23 percent to Â£7.90 per kilo, said trade magazine The Grocer. Norwegian wholesale frozen cod went up 11 percent in the same period - or up by 56 percent on March last year. The Grocer blamed the "general inflationary environment and impact of sanctions on Russia" for this." Prior to sanctions, Russia directly supplied a fifth of all white fish eaten in the UK and indirectly it supplied more. It sends a large share of its catch to China and Germany who process it and sell it to Britain and other countries.
