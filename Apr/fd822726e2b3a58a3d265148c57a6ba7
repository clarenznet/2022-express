Amanda Holden, 51, reunited with her younger sister, Deborah, 50, on Friday after being separated for two years. The blonde siblings looked the spitting image of each other as they enjoyed the sunny weather with glasses of wine. In a series of snaps to her 1.8 million Instagram followers, the Britain’s Got Talent judge also joked that the sisters were like “Thelma and Louise” as they posed in a vintage Morris Minor car. As a tribute to the 1991 film, Amanda and Deborah wrapped scarfs around their heads and shielded their eyes with statement black sunglasses. Deborah lives in Thailand and the pair have been kept apart for two years due to Covid restrictions. She finally arrived back in the UK last week after a gruelling 30-hour journey. She confirmed her return on Instagram with a snap of her rucksack balancing on a train seat. Deborah captioned the post: “29 hours later I’m on the train from Gatwick…not far now!” It seems that Deborah has been staying at Amanda’s during her visit as she shared an early morning snap of Amanda’s dog, Rudie, snuggled up in her duvet. Alongside the adorable photo, she penned: “I have my favourite boy in my bed. Sshhh, don’t tell my sister @noholdenback #nephewdog." Amanda then cheekily joked in the comments: “Mmmm. I see you.”
