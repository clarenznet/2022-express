Emmanuel Macron goes head-to-head with Marine Le Pen tonight in a French presidential election TV debate. The centrist incumbent emerged ahead of his far-right challenger in the first round of voting ahead of the two-way runoff for the presidency on April 24. Mr Macron accompanied his wife Brigitte as she cast her ballot in the first round at a polling station in Le Touquet last week. “We wrote together on Friday nights – and by Saturday, I couldn’t wait for Friday to come around. “I didn’t understand why. It seemed insane.” The pair worked on the script until late at night, with both not having far to travel to get home. Mr Macron lived in Amiens with his parents, both doctors, while Brigitte shared a nearby home with her husband and children. In footage of the play being performed, a fresh-faced Mr Macron and Brigitte can be seen kissing one another on the cheek as the curtain came down. She said: “I was the one who insisted that Emmanuel go to Paris to finish his schooling. “There was nothing between us at that time, but the spiteful gossip was already making the rounds. “My only concern was my children, Sébastien, Laurence, and Tiphaine. Not the rest of the world.” The couple eventually tied the knot in 2007, a decade before Mr Macron became President of France. In tonight’s TV debate, Mr Macron will set out his arguments in a bid to secure a second term as leader. His two-and-a-half-hour duel with Le Pen may make or break which of them is elected President. Mr Macron will hope for a repeat of the 2017 runoff debate when he outclassed his rival to win the presidency.
