The irony in Alexis Zegerman's play is that Professor Richard Myers (Robert Lindsay) is being recognised for his pioneering work in IVF, enabling thousands of childless couples to start families of their own. Myers is suffering from Parkinson's, which has exacerbated his abrasiveness. His second wife Megan (Alexandra Gilbreath) is exhausted from caring for him, and his children are concerned about their financial legacy. On a giant doll's house set revealing various rooms, individual scenes overlap as the son argues with his boyfriend, the ambitious daughter argues with her weak husband, and the glamorous investment banker son reveals a secret that will affect them all. It's intermittently amusing and sometimes puzzling (a ghost girl keeps flitting in and out) but the baggy structure and banal resolution leave us feeling trapped in an overly familiar scenario.
