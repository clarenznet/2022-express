Karen Hauer, 40, and Luba Mushtuk, 32, have caused a stir amongst Instagram users, as the Strictly Come Dancing stars flaunted their enviably toned figures in the shower together.  The professional dancers posed in matching black bikinis, which showed off their abs to perfection.  Both Karen and Luba shared pictures of their spa day on Instagram, with the latter telling her 69,000 followers: “perfect spa day off with my wifey @karenhauer.”  Karen echoed Luba’s sentiment, as she added in view of her 281,000 followers: “Spa day with my Bestie #dayoffwellspent.”  The best pals could be seen larking about under a rainfall shower while smiling for the camera.  In another pic, BBC stars Karen and Luba held hands as they had a giggle in the jacuzzi.  The dancers put their peachy posteriors on display in the selection of spa day snaps, as they both rocked revealing bikini bottoms.  Many Strictly stars took to the comments section of the Instagram posts to gush over the duo, including judge Motsi Mabuse, who simply wrote: “Hotnesses.”
