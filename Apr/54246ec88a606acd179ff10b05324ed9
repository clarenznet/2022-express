However, the tour has already has its ups and downs. Richard will be speaking live from the Daily Express Facebook page tomorrow at 2pm alongside our host Pandora Forsyth. Their visit to Grenada was cancelled because the country felt it wouldn't meet the joint objective of celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and showcasing the country. Buckingham Palace's statement, just one day before the tour began, read: "In consultation with the government of Grenada and on the advice of the Governor-General, The Earl and Countess of Wessex’s visit to Grenada has been postponed. The Earl and Countess hope to visit at a later date.” Elsewhere the Royal Family took the time to celebrate Prince Louis' fourth birthday. To mark the occasion heartwarming new photos taken by the Duchess of Cambridge were released. The photos show the youngest Cambridge prince smiling joyfully with the eastern coastline in the distance. This comes as the Royal Family respond further to the Ukraine war with the Cambridges visiting aid workers. Richard and Pandora will be discussing exactly what the royals have done so far, and if there is there more to be done.
