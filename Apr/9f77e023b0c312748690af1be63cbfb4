Bream is part of a group of volunteers, Vans without borders, organised by Jack Ross who have gone to Ukraine to help deliver food aid for people trapped by the war. The parachute jump off a bombed-out apartment block in Bucha was about 130 foot. Mr Bream, 36, had hit the headlines before in 2020 when he broke the world record for a jump without a parachute of 140 feet from a helicopter into water. The jump took place today on the holiest day of the year in Ukraine where the people there mark the Orthodox Easter day. Mr Bream chose the location because it is where the massacre of Ukrainians happened almost two weeks ago. Mr Ross said: "John is a great guy and he wanted to highlight the plight of the Ukrainians. "We (three British lads) have been bringing aid to vulnerable individuals across Ukraine, and have pioneered new aid routes, direct from Krakow (Poland) to previously unreached (by direct international aid) Ukrainian cities. "We have delivered a variety of items from tinned meat, clothes and water to candles and battery packs - depending on local need - to orphans, the elderly, the disabled and trapped families.   "Additionally, we have established contacts locally which allows us to pass through the region to areas not accessible by others to ensure communities that have just been liberated also have access to vital supplies. "We also plan to evacuate civilians who are stranded from areas under imminent attack."
