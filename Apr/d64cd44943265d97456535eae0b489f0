Bosses at Venari Group have devoted its 120,000 sq ft of shopfloor space in Brighouse, West Yorks, and Goole to make the military-grade vehicles.  The ambulances are constructed from former Army vehicles. These are stripped and converted into specialist transport by the company's highly skilled staff. The Venari workforce has been cranking out the emergency vehicles for 24 hours a day. The first high-protection ambulances are expected to be ready for delivery to Ukraine by the end of the week. Venari Group's chief executive Oliver North, a former Royal Engineer, said he felt compelled to take on the work after the Ukrainian Embassy asked for his help via Goole's Conservative MP Andrew Percy.
