Vehicle Excise Duty, also known as vehicle tax, car tax or road tax, is set to rise in line with inflation from today, April 1, 2022. VED is calculated using the vehicle’s age and CO2 emissions, with bigger, older engines usually producing more CO2, resulting in higher costs. Car tax is made up of two payments which drivers are required to pay: standard rate and first year rate. The first year rate is also known as a “showroom tax” and is based on the CO2 figures when the vehicle was built. The standard rate is the annual renewal a driver will pay annually from there onwards. The 2018 Budget outlined that new diesel vehicles registered after April 1, 2018, that do not meet the real driving emission step 2 (RDE2) standard will be charged a supplement on their first year rate to the effect of moving up by one VED band.

Alternative fuelled vehicles, including hybrids, bioethanol and liquid petroleum gas, pay £155 per annum, while zero emission vehicles, such as electric cars, will continue to pay £0 in VED for the first year. Vehicles producing between 76g and 90g of CO2 emissions per km will see a first-year rate rise from £115 to £120. Vehicles which produce over 255g of CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled will see their first-year rate rise from £2,245 to £2,365.
