  Amanda has repeatedly defied those who have tried to reign in her sense of style, even after one of her dresses racked up a record-breaking 663 official complaints back in 2017. In 2020, some viewers said they could see her nipples falling out of the low-cut, deep blue dress she wore during judging, which sparked yet more complaints. This year, the star made her return to Britain’s Got Talent after two years away from our screens due to the pandemic. The star sent fans wild in her latest outfit - a hot pink rubber dress that was positively skin-tight.  While Amanda received plenty of compliments for the brightly-coloured garment, some people were less impressed, referring to it as a “condom dress”. Nonetheless, Amanda refused to let chatter on social media bother her, as she said: “Of course, I have fun on Britain’s Got Talent - it’s the perfect opportunity to take risks. “Times have changed and I don’t feel anyone should feel pressure to dress for your age. “It’s all about body positivity and feeling good,” she told MailOnline.
