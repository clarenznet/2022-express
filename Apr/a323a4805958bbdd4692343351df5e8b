How they must hope that the war in Ukraine will end soon so that they can get back to the "serious" business of Partygate and call for the Prime Minister to resign. And how they must cringe at witnessing the response of their beloved EU compared to that of the UK regarding military aid and taking the lead role in support of Ukraine. Could this have been the case if we had still been a member of that club? What we are witnessing in Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine is that the true warriors of the former USSR were in fact the Ukrainians. An oversight and fact forgotten by Vladimir Putin, says Sam Turner, from Sandown, Isle of Wight. ----- I don't believe Rishi Sunak has morals or principles. His recent poorly thought out publicity stunt of filling up a modest family car backfired spectacularly and following the debacle of his wife's tax status I sincerely hope his ambitions to become the next PM are now completely dashed, says Kathryn Hill, from Queniborough, Leics. He abandoned the elderly in his Spring Statement - there is nothing moral or principled about that. ----- While it annoys me that Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife has avoided so much tax, what annoys me a lot more is jealous, no-hoper Lefties jumping on the bandwagon to give her a kicking, says Steve Collard, from Torquay, Devon. Don't they realise how this makes them look? ------
