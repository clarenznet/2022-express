Amal Clooney, 44, turned heads in New York City on Friday as she donned a daring pair of Christian Louboutin leather boots paired with a leopard print coat and grey knitted dress. The human rights barrister looked as elegant as ever with her silky brunette hair styled in loose waves and minimal makeup to show off her natural beauty. She accessorised the look with a black cross-body bag and a pair of statement sunglasses to shield her eyes. The mother-of-two arrived in New York earlier this week and attended a United Nations Security Council meeting. In a speech on Wednesday, Amal told the UN that Ukraine is a “slaughterhouse right in the heart of Europe” and urged countries not to ignore Russia’s invasion. During her time in the city, Amal also spent time with her mother, Baria Alamuddin. The duo was pictured heading out for dinner on Thursday and Amal looked stunning in a sleeveless red dress.
