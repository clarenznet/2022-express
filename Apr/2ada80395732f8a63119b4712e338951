Chris Rock’s brother, Tony Rock, has addressed the Oscars 2022 incident that saw actor Will Smith slap his brother. Tony reportedly referenced the incident on two occasions during his latest comedy show. He told the audience: "If you think you gonna walk up on this stage, this ain't the motherf***ing Oscars. "And if you walk your a** you here, you ain't nominated for s**t but these mothef***ing hands! “Oh, we are going to pop the rest of the year. Every time you see me do a show, pop!" Tony later added: "I didn't want to start the show like that! "You gonna hit my motherf***ing brother because your b***h gave you a side-eye?" The moment in question took place last Sunday after Chris made a joke about Will’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sporting a buzzcut. The actress has a condition called alopecia which causes hair loss. Moments after the jibe, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air actor was seen storming the stage and hitting Chris across the face. Will has since offered Chris a public apology as he stressed that he “deeply regrets” his behaviour. In a statement shared with his 63 million Instagram followers, Will explained why the joke was “too much for [him] to bear”. He wrote: “Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. “My behaviour at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.

I was out of line and I was wrong." Will added: ”I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. “There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness. “I would also like to apologise to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees and everyone watching around the world. “I would like to apologise to the Williams Family and my King Richard Family.” Will has since resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as he explained via his representatives that he accepts full responsibility for his actions.
