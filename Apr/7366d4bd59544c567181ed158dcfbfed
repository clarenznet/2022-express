The Cambridges – who currently divide their time between Kensington Palace, London and Anmer Hall, Norfolk – have reportedly been looking at a number of royal residences close to the Queen in Windsor. They are said to have looked at several properties including Prince Andrew’s Royal Lodge – yet he has no intention of moving. They have ruled out Fort Belvedere located on the edge of Windsor Great Park, former home to King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. The Sun reported on Sunday that the Cambridges have also eyed up Frogmore House and the currently-occupied Adelaide Cottage. Royal sources dismissed claims they will move into apartments in Windsor Castle. William and Kate are also said to be considering private homes in the area. They are also looking at schools for Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince  Louis, three, in Windsor, Buckinghamshire and Surrey. The move also comes following fears Andrew is getting too close to the Queen. A source told The Sun: “The need to move to Windsor is growing more and more. Andrew spends a lot of time with the Queen. “He lives next door and is always there for her. During the Covid lockdown, the family were glad Andrew was always on hand. “There are real fears that despite being banished from The Firm in January, he is using his closeness to the Queen as a springboard back into public life.” William is also preparing to reinvent the role of the Prince of Wales and secure the future of the monarchy.
