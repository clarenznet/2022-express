All hospitals in Lincolnshire, a county that serves more than one million people, are under immense pressure at the moment. United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT) says it is still also struggling after a fire at one its facilities - Lincoln County Hospital - experienced a fire last month.  It, along with County Hospital Louth, Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Skegness and District Hospital and Grantham and District Hospital, are now subject of the critical incident. Andrew Morgan, the Chief Executive of the trust, said: "Our hospitals are continuing to see exceptionally high levels of demand for our services, along with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, and our emergency diagnostic capacity being reduced as a result of the recent fire. "We are continuing to work with our system partners to prioritise those in most urgent need of hospital treatment and urge people to get medical help when they need it for non life-threatening issues by using NHS 111 online." Members of the Armed Forces assisted at the trust's facilities, primarily at Lincoln and Boston, earlier this year, Lincolnshire Live reports. Mr Morgan added: "Despite the current demand, essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them so if you require emergency medical help, please continue to come forward." Patients and staff at Lincoln County Hospital were evacuated due to the blaze in March. No one was hurt. The hospital, which opened in 1776, is the largest in Lincolnshire with more than 600 beds. It was rated as "Requires Improvement" after its last inspection by healthcare watchdog Care Quality Commission last year.
