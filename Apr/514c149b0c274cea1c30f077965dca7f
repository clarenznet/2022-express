Microwaves are a kitchen essential for many people, helping whip up fast meals or speed up the defrosting process of frozen goods. However, since the energy price cap rose at the beginning of April, some households in the UK have seen bills rise by as much as 54 percent. Though the reasons behind the price cap rise are beyond our control, keeping track of how often you use certain household appliances can help to keep bills somewhat lower. However, each household appliance uses a different amount of energy and thus adds a different sum to your monthly bill. To determine exactly how much energy your microwave is using, and thus how much it costs to run, you need to understand its wattage. Microwaves are rated in either Watts (W) or Kilowatts (kW) for commercial ovens. You can find this usually on the back of the machine or in the manual. A standard microwave found in the home usually runs between 600w and 1000W, though this can vary. Based on the April price cap rise in the UK, Sust-it.net has created an energy calculator that determines how much your microwave will use for certain periods of time.

He explained: "Gas is a cheaper alternative to electricity and therefore cooking your soup on a gas hob is the cheapest option.” Microwaves are efficient as they only heat the food itself rather than waste energy heating the air around them. If you are looking to save energy being wasted from your microwave, a key tip is to turn them off at the plug after every use.
