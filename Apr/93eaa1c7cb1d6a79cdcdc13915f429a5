Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, but 10 percent of sufferers are slimmer, with a lower Body Mass Index (BMI).  A trial led by Prof Roy Taylor of Newcastle University found that 70 percent of participants with a low BMI went into type 2 remission thanks to diet-controlled weight loss. The key was losing harmful fat from the liver and pancreas. Chris Askew, of Diabetes UK, called the study "game changing".
