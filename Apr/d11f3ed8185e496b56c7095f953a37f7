On April 9, 2021, the Queen's beloved husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, died at the age of 99 at Windsor. The Queen and Prince Philip had been married for 73 years and together they shared four children, eight grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. His sendoff took place at Windsor Castle a few days later, and last week members of the Royal Family gathered at Westminster Abbey for a poignant service of thanksgiving to say their final farewells.
