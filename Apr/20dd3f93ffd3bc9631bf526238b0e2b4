Looking for the best AirPods Pro deals? Here it is – Amazon UK has slashed these £239 wireless earbuds down to just £189 – with free next-day delivery for Prime members. That's a great deal for these Apple-designed wireless 'buds, which boast a sweat-resistant design, interchangeable tips for a better fit in your ears, active noise-cancellation to strip out background noise when listening to music and podcasts, support wireless charging, and include beam-forming microphones for crystal-clear phone calls and FaceTime videos. In fact, it's only £20 more than Apple charges for its third-generation AirPods, which do not ship with active noise-cancellation or interchangeable tips for a better seal. That's a no-brainer as you'll be getting the best AirPods that Apple sells for a fraction more than the mid-tier model. AirPods Pro currently cost £239 from your local Apple Store, but unless you want to take advantage of Apple's free engraving to personalise your charging case, there are much better deals to be had. Express.co.uk has been scouring the best Apple AirPods Pro deals around right now. Apple unveiled its first-generation AirPods back in September 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These 'buds were designed to solve many of the headaches of Bluetooth headphones, including the hassle of scouring the Bluetooth settings on your iPhone to connect to the device each time you wanted to listen to a song or podcast. And if you wanted to switch to another device, you'd have to start from scratch and pair to the new gadget. AirPods ended all of that palaver, thanks to the custom-designed silicon inside the 'buds. Instead of launching the Settings menu and pairing a new device, AirPods owners only need to flip open the charging case beside their iPhone for the first time, which will trigger a pop-up on-screen to pair with the handset. And that's it. Better still, any other Apple-branded devices linked with the same iCloud account will be paired with the AirPods at the same time. With a single tap, owners will see their new AirPods linked with iPads, MacBooks, and even Apple TVs (perfect for watching without the speakers built into your telly or sound system late at night). Apple uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to pair AirPods seamlessly between devices too. If the technology company thinks you're trying to play songs on your iPhone – the AirPods will switch from your Mac, or if you answer a FaceTime call on your iPad – the earbuds in your ears will switch in the background. If you get a phone call, AirPods will always default back to your iPhone, even if you're watching a movie on your Mac or iPad, so you won't have to worry about jumping into the Settings menu before picking up. AirPods Pro launched in October 2019 and introduced a more compact form factor. These 'buds were also the first to introduce interchangeable silicone tips, which create a better seal within the ear canal than the one-size-fits-all approach employed by the original AirPods. Apple also added an Ear Tip Fit Test inside the Bluetooth menu that uses software to analyse whether you've fitted the best tips for your ear shape. But the biggest selling point of the AirPods Pro was the introduction of active noise-cancellation. This technology leverages the four microphones included in the AirPods Pro to track low-frequency noise – like the rumble of inside a train carriage, the hum of an aeroplane's engine or the hubbub of colleagues talking – and neutralise it before it reaches the ear. To do this, AirPods Pro generates a sound that's phase-inverted by 180-degrees to the unwanted low-frequency noise, which cancels out the original sound. Without the clatter of the world around you, you'll be able to lower the volume and still hear your favourite podcast, album, TV episode or movie. AirPods Pro is powered by the custom-designed H1 chip, which enables some of the earbuds' unique features, like Spatial Audio. This small but powerful chipset is the reason you won't find Spatial Audio on other third-party earbuds for the iPhone. It also enables the trademark one-tap pairing between Apple devices and AirPods, which saves you from digging through the Settings menu. Instead, the wireless 'buds will pair the first time that you flip open the case beside an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. The AirPods will be synchronised with your Apple ID account. As such, if you own other Apple-branded devices, your new AirPods Pro will automatically switch as you move between them – and pair with your iPhone again as soon as you have an incoming call. Your new AirPods Pro arrive with a carry case that charges the battery of the earbuds when you're on the move. With noise-cancellation switched on, AirPods Pro offer around 4.5 hours of listening time. With the case, you'll be able to charge up the pair of AirPods Pro with enough battery life for 24-hours of music or podcasts, and a slightly shorter 18-hour total time when using the microphones for hands-free calls. With the latest model of AirPods Pro, the carry case can be recharged using a MagSafe charger, which snaps to the back of the case with magnets and charges at a faster speed. The iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models all support this new technology too, so you'll be able to use the same MagSafe charger puck for both devices. If you're looking for the single best deal on the AirPods Pro in the UK right now, look no further than Amazon UK. For months, the online retailer had price-matched John Lewis and Argos. However, with its latest discount, Amazon has finally pulled ahead of the crowd. At £189, this is one of the lowest prices we've ever seen for the popular wireless earbuds. And if you're a Prime member, you'll be able to get your new AirPods Pro delivered tomorrow at no extra cost.
