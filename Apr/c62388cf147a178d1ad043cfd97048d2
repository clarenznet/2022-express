Meghan and Prince Harry met during the summer of 2016 and, as confessed by the Duke himself during his interview with James Corden in February last year. Speaking to the British comedian during a special episode of his Late Late Show, Harry said he and Meghan immediately "hit it off" and their relationship went from 0 to 60 within just weeks. The pair eventually announced their engagement in November 2017 and tied the knot in May 2018. But, even before becoming a Duchess, Meghan started performing a few royal duties, taking part in visits and engagements with Prince Harry as a clear sign she wanted to hit the ground running with her work. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex carried out several royal duties both solo and jointly and a few important foreign trips during their time as working royals. However, in January 2020 they announced they wanted to create a new role for themselves within the Firm, which would have seen them continue to represent the Crown while also becoming financially independent from the Sovereign Grant and pursuing financially profitable endeavours. After this solution was deemed not possible, Meghan and Harry officially stepped down as senior royals at the end of March 2020. Over the past two years, they have created a new life for themselves and their two children in California. In late 2020, they launched their organisation Archewell, which includes production powerhouses for audio and video content and their non-profit foundation which recently made donations in support of organisations working on the ground in Ukraine. The Sussexes have also struck deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce exclusive content for these streaming platforms. As announced last month, Meghan will release this summer Archewell's first podcast series, called Archetypes. The Sussexes are also working on two series for Netflix - Heart of Invictus and Pearl. Moreover, Prince Harry is to release an "intimate" memoir later this year. While Meghan and the children have yet to travel to the UK since the Sussexes stopped being working royals, the Duke returned on two occasions in 2021 - first to attend the funeral of Prince Philip last April and later in July to unveil the statue of Princess Diana at Kensington Palace.
