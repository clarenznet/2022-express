Anna Bonner, 40, told Susan Hughes that a bouncer at a New Brighton club they went to - and who Susan had a crush on - needed treatment in the US.  Over the next five years Susan handed over various sums to Bonner, who used the money to fund her lavish lifestyle. She admitted fraud and was jailed for 28 months. Liverpool Crown Court heard that the women met in 1999 and Susan had been Bonner's bridesmaid. Susan is now in "crippling debt", the prosecution said.
