  Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two presenter Rylan Clark has admitted he is keen to see Big Brother come back, as it “changed his life”. Rylan spoke to Express.co.uk about how the show had given him both a “career and a husband” at the Boots No7 Pro Derm Scan launch party on Tuesday.     Rylan, 33, has been a part of some of the UK’s biggest reality shows over the years. Starting his career ten years ago on the ninth series of The X Factor, Rylan has recently revealed that he will be releasing a book entitled 10 to celebrate a decade of working in the showbiz industry. The star won the 11th series of Celebrity Big Brother the following year in 2013, which launched his career as a presenter in shows like Big Brother's Bit on the Side, This Morning and The Xtra Factor. Celebrity Big Brother was also where the Radio 2 DJ met husband Dan Neal, with whom he split from last June after six years of marriage.

Big Brother changed my life.” Rylan was then asked whether he would like to host the show if it did make a return to our screens.     “That wouldn't be up to me, but Big Brother needs to come back,” he replied. Rylan doesn’t seem to be alone in this regard, as one of his recent Twitter posts proved fans of the show were still eager to see its return. Last month, Rylan teased the announcement of his new book, telling his 1.7 million Twitter followers: “Little announcement 6pm (I’m not pregnant).” (sic) At this, Marcus Bentley asked: “Is Big Brother coming back?"

The world needs it.” “Big brother coming back omg yes I knew it!!!!” Dave wrote excitedly. After plenty of similar guesses, Rylan was forced to dispel the notion, confirming: “Not big bro related soz. Trust me I wish it was x.” Elsewhere in the interview, Rylan suggested that his honesty under the public eye has helped him keep his career, although being under the spotlight has sometimes been tough on his mental health.      When he split from husband Dan, the star admitted that he had become very ill and lost weight, retreating from the spotlight for months due to his mental health struggles. Speaking about his knack for being open with the public, Rylan said: “I think that's part of why I'm still here 10 years on. “I've always been honest. I've been honest with the public, I've been honest with my family, I’ve been honest with my relationship. “I have had a lot of support from the public,” he added. “It was also one of the things that contributed to me not feeling great, being who I was, and then being put in a position to say something that wasn't necessarily true, being so ill.” Since then, Rylan has been on the mend and said he is now feeling positive about the future, confirming: “I’m ready.”
