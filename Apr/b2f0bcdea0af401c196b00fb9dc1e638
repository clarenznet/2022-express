Demi Rose, 27, risked baring it all in a new video uploaded to her Instagram, where she boasts 19.3 million followers. The model stunned as she posed in just a white robe and flaunted her new hairstyle. In the video, Demi could be seen sitting on a chair backstage as she got ready with her hairstylist and make-up artist. She put her ample cleavage on display as she wore her robe off her shoulders, placing her hands on her lap while giving the camera a seductive look. The camera panned closer to the Birmingham-born social media star, as she showed off her make-up and long, blond hair. She opted for a bold eye make-up look with long winged eyeliner and earthy eyeshadow tones, which she combined with a nude lip.
