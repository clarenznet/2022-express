The feline family became trapped in the water spouts of a home in Birmingham - leading to a response by the animal welfare charity. Residents in the area heard a noise outside a bedroom window, and discovered a stray cat trying to give birth to her babies.  With heavy rain due, the RSPCA said: “We knew we had to get to them fast.” The mother cat, named Storm, gave birth to five kittens. Pictures show a rescuer, joined by firefighters, lifting Storm to safety. Another image shows how tiny one of the newborn kitten is - as it is smaller than the rescuer's hand.  In line with the weather-themed names, Rain, Thunder, Misty, Foggy and Hail are now safely at a local animal centre. Attempts were made to find the owners of the mother cat - but an outdated microchip did not lead to the owners being located.

RSPCA Inspector Adam Bailey said: “The mum cat had decided to give birth to her five kittens in the conservatory guttering of the property and with heavy rain due to set in we knew we had to get to them fast. "Alongside fire and rescue, I managed to get up onto the roof of the conservatory and slowly but surely contain the mother using a reach and rescue pole and then pick up each kitten and bring them to safety." Three-year-old Storm and her new family are receiving some "much-needed care and attention" at Newbrook Farm Animal Centre, the charity said.
