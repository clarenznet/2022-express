The process targets the liver better by "bathing" it in drugs. Pioneered at University Hospital Southampton, the new approach involves two small balloons which divert blood past the organ while delivering drugs directly into it.  After an hour, chemical-treated blood in the liver is filtered and returned clean to the body through a vein. Writing in Melanoma Research, scientists said 88.9 per cent of liver cancers were controlled following the treatment, known as percutaneous hepatic perfusion. And 62 per cent survived for a year - 30 per cent for more than two years. Researchers said the process, not offered on the NHS, limits damage to normal tissue, unlike surgery or conventional chemotherapy.
