David Haines, 44, was captured by IS forces in Syria in 2013 and killed the following year. A Virginia court has now found El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, guilty of eight charges relating to four US hostages killed by the "Beatles" - four terrorists so nicknamed because of their London accents. David's brother Mike said: "An eight-year chapter of pain for my family has finally come to an end. "While nothing can truly compensate for the hole David's murder left in our hearts, the verdict provides us with some closure and ensures that all three surviving members of the gang involved in my brother's murder have now faced justice." David's daughter Bethany Haines said the conclusion of the trial was "a lot more emotional" than she expected. She added: "I expected to be happy, but it's the realisation that he's guilty - what he's done to all the families, all the hostages. I've not slept a full night's sleep probably since my dad was killed." Elsheikh was born in Sudan but raised in west London.As a young man, he mixed with fellow "Beatles" Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, and Alexanda Kotey. They later went to Syria and teamed up with Londoner Aine Davis, the fourth gang member. Emwazi was killed in a drone strike in Syria in 2015. Davis is in custody in Turkey, while Kotey is behind bars in the US after he admitted hostagetaking and murder. Elsheikh was found guilty of eight counts, but the murders of Mr Haines and fellow Briton Alan Henning were not on the indictment. Elsheikh is set to be jailed for life and sent to a maximum security prison later this month.
