Victoria Beckham, 48, posed alongside her new daughter-in-law Nicola Peltz, 27, in a photo shared to Nicola’s Instagram yesterday. Also in the photo was Nicola’s stunning mother Claudia, and the family resemblance is evident. Nicola stood with her arms around her mum and Victoria, who both looked chic in black and gave the camera a modest, cool smile. “Happy birthday @victoriabeckham,” wrote Nicola, alongside some love heart emojis. Claudia, who used to be a model, married billionaire businessman Nelson in 1985 and ten years later welcomed daughter Nicola, who married Brooklyn Beckham, 23, last week. Their stunning £3.5million ceremony took place at Nicola’s billionaire parents’ £71million estate in Palm Beach, with the couple getting married by a Rabbi, beneath a flower-garlanded chuppah to honour Nicola’s Jewish heritage. Brooklyn’s family played a key role at the wedding – with his 10-year-old sister Harper stepping up as a bridesmaid, and 19-year-old Romeo and 17-year-old Cruz as joint best men. Meanwhile, Victoria posted a photo of the very cheeky card her husband David had got her yesterday - featuring a photo of the fashion designer passed out by the toilet, and another snap of her behind in gym leggings.
