Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid has led a hoard of celebrities in gushing over Amanda Holden's latest set of racy snaps on Instagram. Earlier today, the Britain's Got Talent host, 51, put on a racy display in a pair of leather hot pants and sheer black top, leaving little to the imagination. The star had previously worn the revealing get up worn for her birthday in February. But this evening, in view of her 1.8 million followers, the mother-of-two posed in front of the stunning backdrop of London at sunset while posing in the racy get up. Amanda captioned the snap: "Golden sunset in London @BGT @christianvermaak." The star posed in a sheer long-sleeved top, accessorising with gold chains dangling down over her black shorts. A trendy black PVC bra stood out underneath her sophisticated ensemble, and she paired the look with strappy gold heels.
