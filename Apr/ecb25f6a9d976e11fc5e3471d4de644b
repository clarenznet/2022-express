The TV presenter revealed she has been doing "physio" and going for "uphill walks" following the operation she had last summer after a tumble in her garden. The 87-year-old joked that, though she may not be doing a bungee jump anytime soon, she had no plans to retire as there would be "plenty of time to rest in heaven".  Dame Mary told Woman's Weekly magazine: "My daughter Annabel and all the family were wonderful - helping out while I got better. "Also, I have a very sweet neighbour, Victoria, who cooked all these lovely dishes like lasagne, which was so thoughtful. I'm fine [now]...I've been doing lots of physio and going for walks uphill close to home to get my mobility back. "I had no idea it was going to take quite so long, but I have been patient with it. I'm happy with what's happening right now. I don't have a list of unfulfilled ambitions - you won't be seeing me doing a bungee jump any time soon."  "But there's plenty of time to rest in heaven, so I won't be retiring." The mother of three and grandmother of five also said she was "very excited" to be a judge for the Queen's Platinum Pudding Competition in the summer. "I'm looking forward to some of the things going on this year," she said. Dame Mary has published more than 75 cookery books. She was a judge on the original Great British Bake Off, from its launch in 2010 to 2016.
