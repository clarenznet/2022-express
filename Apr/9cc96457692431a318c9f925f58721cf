Police have started an investigation into the deaths of the 54-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman, who were discovered at Goth Ink in Canterbury, Kent, yesterday afternoon. Forensic officers in white uniforms have today been pictured in the shop in the heart of the cathedral city. At least eight police vehicles and four ambulances were seen in the area last night. The man and woman were known to each other, reports Kent Live, but police are yet to confirm their exact relationship. A statement today from Kent Constabulary said: "Detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate are investigating the deaths of two people in Canterbury. "At 5.19pm on Monday 11 April 2022, officers attended an address in Lower Bridge Street, where a 54-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman, who were known to each other, were pronounced deceased at the scene. "Enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident are ongoing. However, officers are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation." The man and woman were pronounced dead at the tattoo parlour, which is on a major road through the city. Part of the road was closed yesterday but has since reopened. Photos taken this morning show tarpaulin sheets covering the front of the parlour. A patrol car is seen parked outside the small building, which is beside other businesses. Two tattoo artists from Goth Ink shared a message on Instagram warning customers not to arrive for appointments. It read: "All clients with appointments over the next few days. Please do not come to the shop. All appointments are postponed." The investigation continues.
