Bookmakers are branding the 174th running "the £150million race" - with more punters able to have a flutter now betting shops have reopened. All 70,000 tickets are sold for Saturday's main event and 10,000 of today's fans are frontline workers on "Liverpool NHS Day" in recognition of their efforts during the pandemic.  Coral's David Stevens said: "We're braced for the busiest day of the year that will see £150million bet on the biggest race of them all." And Dickon White, the Jockey Club's North West regional director remarked: "There's been such a buzz." Last year's first woman winner Rachael Blackmore, 32, aims for back-to-back victories on Minella Times after racing behind closed doors last year. The favourite is Snow Leopardess ridden by Irishman Aidan Coleman.
