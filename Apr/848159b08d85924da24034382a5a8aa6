The Baggs family began to discuss how butter was made when youngest son George made the hilarious admission, leaving his family members and viewers baffled. Channel 4 viewers were quick to comment as the Gogglebox family went on to debate how tomatoes were grown before Joe commented "We are thick as s***!" While the family were talking, the subject of how butter is formed came up. "I thought butter was butter," 19-year-old George stated, confused by his family's response. "Where do you think butter comes from?" his mother Lisa asked, bewildered. "I thought butter was butter," he repeated as Joe added: "But obviously it's dairy right? So what part of the cow do you think it comes from?"

Lisa gasped as Joe questioned: "What like the sludgy after bit, like a plug?" He added: "That's disgusting!" while Geroge commented: "Well, you learn something new every day, I guess." "Honestly... what school did you go to?" Joe asked before Lisa elaborated on where other foods come from. "You do know, you get the microwavable jacket potatoes - which are filth - they don't actually just make them in the supermarket." She went on: "They come out of the ground." George replied: "I know that mum!" He went on to argue: "It's the same with tomatoes." "What do you mean tomatoes?" Lisa quizzed her son, still seeming baffled. DON'T MISS...
