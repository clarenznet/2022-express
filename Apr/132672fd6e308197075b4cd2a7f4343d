Demi Rose, 27, set pulses racing as she gave fans a glimpse into her ski trip to France. The model took to Instagram yesterday, where she enjoys a following of 19.3 million, to upload a series of jaw-dropping photos. In the first image, Demi could be seen posing inside a cable car in a white ski suit that put her cleavage on display. The suit, which features red and black geometric patterns, cinched her tiny waist and matched her ski goggles. In one of the pictures, Demi could be seen smiling and posing alongside a friend next to the ski slopes. The social media star captioned the post: “Just doing bestie things.” Fans soon rushed to the post’s comments section to heap praise on the stunning model. Rfprado4567 said: “Wow, I love seeing all these incredible photos.” Fbtl.dt added: “You’re really beautiful.” Prior to last night’s post, over the weekend Demi shared a photo of herself in a helicopter as her caption teased: “Where we going?” (sic)
