Tensions on the estate in Wrexham, north Wales, "quickly escalated" at around 11.40pm to the point riot police and a force helicopter had to intervene. The huge crowd even threw several objects at police but, luckily, no one was injured in the fracas. Photographs show officers wearing protective clothing, and holding large shields amid the violence. North Wales Constabulary say it is currently unknown what sparked the scenes, which happened on a suburban estate where many young families live. Speaking last night, a force spokesman told North Wales Live said: "Officers were tonight called to deal with a large number of people causing a disturbance in Wynnstay Avenue, Wrexham. "Additional officers in protective clothing were called after a number of missiles were thrown." Superintendent Owain Llewellyn, of the force, said: "Our priority was ensuring the safety of people in the area and there was at one point a large number of officers there whilst we worked to calm the situation which had escalated quickly. Missiles were thrown at officers, although thankfully none were injured, but damage was caused to cars and property. "I appreciate that our presence on this scale and in protective clothing will have caused local concern and thank people for their patience whilst we worked to resolve the situation. "Officers will remain in the area overnight whilst our investigations continue and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us on 101." It follows similar senseless scenes on a housing estate in Middlesbrough, Teesside, where young thugs taunted vulnerable pensioners and vandalised property. Andy Preston, Mayor of Middlesbrough, said courts are "way too soft" following the spate of antisocial behaviour in his town.
