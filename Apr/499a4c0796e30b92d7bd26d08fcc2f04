Speaking out on the latest research finding from University College London (UCL), Dr Xand highlighted the warning signs people shouldn't ignore. "There's lots of things to look for," Dr Xand began. "Some of them are kind of obvious; things I hope we all know about." One such sign, for example, is a lump in the breast that could be a sign of cancer. However, he urges everybody who is concerned about a niggling health issue to tell a doctor if they suspect it could be cancer. "They will be able to reassure you or start to investigate what's going on," Dr Xand added. With more than one in two people expected to receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, early diagnosis is critical. Each year, there are 375,OOO cancer cases in the UK, with nearly all being treatable in the earliest stages. Dr Xand, on BBC's Morning Live, listed possible symptoms of cancer that could be "easy to ignore". Possible signs of cancer: "If you feel like your body is not the way it should be for a protracted period of time, do say to your GP, 'I am worried about cancer, can you look into this for me?'" Dr Xand instructed. In light of UCL's findings, Dr Xand warned this is a "significant problem". By waiting until issues get so bad that you are ending up in A&E before seeking help, a late cancer diagnosis could be on the horizon. This is incredibly dangerous for two main reasons. Firstly, over time, the cancer could grow and spread elsewhere in the body. As such, cancer that has spread around the body becomes harder to treat. And, secondly, cancer can make it difficult to live life in the way you would like to as symptoms can weaken you. Moreover, it can make you more vulnerable to the effects of treatment.
