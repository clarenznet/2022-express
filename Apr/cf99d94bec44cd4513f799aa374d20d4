Women, those who are obese and anyone put on mechanical ventilation in hospital are more likely to suffer from long Covid, according to the research. The most common symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain and breathlessness. Professor Louise Wain, the British Lung Foundation Chair in Respiratory Research, said: “No specific therapeutics exist for long Covid and our data highlights that interventions are urgently required. “The findings also suggest the need for complex interventions that target both physical and mental health impairments to alleviate symptoms.” Professor Christopher Brightling, from the National Institute for Health Research, said: “Our study highlights an urgent need for health care services to ­support this rapidly increasing patient population. “Without effective treatments, long Covid could become a highly prevalent, new long-term condition.” Dr Rachael Evans, from the University of Leicester, said: “The limited recovery from five months to a year after ­hospitalisation is striking.” In the study, more than 2,000 patients were monitored after admittance, with five-month and one-year follow-up assessments. Researchers found women were 32 percent less likely to fully recover after one year. Those who were obese were half as likely, and those who had mechanical ventilation in hospital were 58 percent less likely. The report is published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The findings are due to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Lisbon, Portugal, this week.
