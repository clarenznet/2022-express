Just Stop Oil protesters were locked on to pipework at a terminal in Grays, Essex, on Monday as they demanded the Government halts new fossil fuel projects.

"Above the Midlands in the North, in Scotlandâ€¦there's no problems whatsoever." Downing Street this week promised to crack down on eco-activists using "guerrilla tactics".
