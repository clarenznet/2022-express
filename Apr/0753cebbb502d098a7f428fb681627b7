Deilwen Breese from Pennal, near Machnynlleth, said powerful winds on Wednesday, April 6, pulled up trees near her property. She also claimed her lambs were sensationally lifted and she was left in tears as her lambs flew through the air. No injuries were reported, however but Ms Breese estimates "there is over £100,000 of work to do just on the roofs". Ms Breese, who rents out holiday cottages on her farm, was not at home when the damage took place. She said visitors staying in one of her cottages described seeing "the wind turning as it came up the meadow and whipped everything in front of it. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Breese added: “When I came back, the road to the house was closed and every tree had fallen like matches. "The wind had even lifted up lambs in the sheds." She added that was "grateful" to friends and locals who rallied together to cover the roofs within three hours. READ MORE: Brexit LIVE: 'Are we supposed to be grateful?'
