Heat pumps draw energy from the air or ground using electricity. But they cost about £10,000 to fit. Sir John Armitt, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, said: "Why would you move to a heat pump at between £5,000 to £15,000 when you can buy or exchange for a new gas boiler for £1,500." "The only way you can make such a significant shift is by saying from a particular date, you won't be able to buy a new gas boiler." The Government wants 600,000 pumps installed annually by 2028. But one alternative is green gas from grass, produced on farms. It provides 100 percent clean power without the need to get rid of existing boilers. Ecotricity founder Dale Vince said: "We don't need to change any gas mains infrastructure. More importantly, consumers won't need to change appliances." The Daily Express and green energy giant Ecotricity have launched a campaign to save Britain's gas boilers.
