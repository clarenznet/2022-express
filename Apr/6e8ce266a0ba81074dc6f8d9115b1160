Sam in his last race won on 50/1 outsider Noble Yeats, who dad Robert bought just two months ago. After his win the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tweeted: “Huge congratulations to @swaleycohen. What a way to retire!” The 39-year-old is credited with reuniting pal Kate Middleton with Prince William after they split in 2007 while dating. He invited them to a party at his 17th-century Oxfordshire mansion. In weeks they were back together and holidaying in the Seychelles. Bookies say Sam’s odds of winning the Sports Personality vote in December have halved to 50/1. Coral said: “Now having ended his career with victory in the famous Aintree race, Sam Waley-Cohen surely has to be in the running for this year’s BBC award.” Sam went to boarding school with Kate and she helped raise funds for a ward in his brother’s Thomas’s memory at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. Thomas died aged 20 of bone cancer in 2004. After Saturday’s race, Sam said: “These days are big family days, and obviously Thomas isn’t with us, so you always think about him on these days. I always ride with his initials on my saddle. I do think he is sitting on my back. “It’s a fairytale, a fantasy. There’s a lot of love and gratefulness.” Yesterday, Sam, his dad, the winning horse and trainer Emmet Mullins had a homecoming parade in County Carlow, Ireland. Sam has been riding for 23 years and won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and had four other top-10 National finishes. After his win he said he would celebrate with a cup of tea. Waley-Cohen – a father-of-three – also owns 250 dental practices. Aintree’s 70,000 sellout on Saturday follows Covid lock-outs.
