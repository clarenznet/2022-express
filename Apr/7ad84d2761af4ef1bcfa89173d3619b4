She was just 15 months old when PC Brian Bateson, answering a 999 call, gave her the kiss of life in April 1970. PC Bateson came to her rescue after she almost drowned in the bath. Gina, 53, had always wanted to find her saviour but only knew his first name. Then, after her mother Sandra, 70, died earlier this year, Gina found an old photo of herself as a baby with PC Bateson among her possessions. And she found someone on Facebook who recognised Brian and put her in touch with his son, Mark, 64.  He told her his father had sadly died, aged 72, in 2003. Gina was "heartbroken" she could not meet him again but said she was grateful to have the chance to thank his family. Gina, of Peterborough, has five children of her own and eight grandchildren. She said: "I was at my mum's after she died going through pictures and found it and thought I would have another go at finding the police officer.Â  I didn't realise how bad it was until I read about it in the newspaper article. "I'm so lucky to be here. I would just give him the biggest hug and thank him. "If it hadn't had been for him I wouldn't be here, my kids wouldn't be here and my grandchildren wouldn't be here.  "I would have really liked to have met him and had a chat with him about how it all came about. "I have messaged Brian's family and they are happy that he has not been forgotten. Brian's family seem really nice and seem happy that I have put it out on social media. Both me and his family have some closure about it." Mark sent Gina the original newspaper article about the rescue in Bradford, West Yorks, and said his father won a Royal Humane Society award in June 1970. Mark said his mum Maureen, 90, was "over the moon" to hear from Gina, adding: "My mum would always say 'I always wondered what happened to that woman'."
