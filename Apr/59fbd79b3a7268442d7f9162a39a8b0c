Sandra Watson was devastated after planners at Glasgow City Council deemed the fence too tall based on measurement guidance. When Ms Watson, who lives in the Ruchill area of the city, appealed against the decision, the fence was remeasured and found to be 1.8 metres. The allowed height is two metres. And, in her argument, Ms Watson said reducing its height would "afford her no privacy whatsoever". She said: "The fence I have erected within my back garden is fully compliant with the two metre height restriction. "Every other property in the neighbourhood has a two-metre fence surrounding their garden for privacy and my fence is identical in height and width to all other properties in the area." The council initially calculated the fence was "nine feet in height" as they measured it from the lowest point immediately adjacent to it according to guidance, Glasgow Live reports.  But the Scottish Government reporter disagrees with the authority's findings. They said: "In this case, as observed at my site inspection, the fence is entirely within the boundary of the property and the ground is level on either side. My measurement of its height at 1.8 metres is clear and unambiguous. "The council’s appeal response considers the fence to be nine-feet high, with the measurement taken from the lowest point of the adjoining garden. Whilst this may appear to be the case it is not accurate because it does not take into account the level ground between the base of the new fence and the property boundary." A council statement in response to the appeal said: "The appellant alleges that the fence is 2 metres in height. As per the Scottish Government guidance, when taken from the lowest point, the fence is over 2 metres and this can be clearly seen in the provided photograph." "The council’s case for taking enforcement action is straightforward. The fence exceeds permitted development rights and also exceeds the height allowed for by the City Development Plan policy."
