Officers are attending the scene where two properties on Diamond Road in Thornaby have been cordoned off. Another house on Northallerton Road has also been taped off by police. Teesside Live reports that blood could be seen on the road from Blencathra Close at the junction of Northallerton Road onto Diamond Road. Neighbours said there was a house party and a "commotion" in the early hours of Saturday. One said the incident kicked off on Northallerton Road and spilled onto Diamond Road. A group of young men were seen running in the street, she said. The neighbour said police arrived followed by an ambulance shortly afterwards. She told Teesside Live: "I just seen a load of lads coming out of that house at about 2 o'clock. "The police smashed the door in last night because there was nobody in. "They didn't cordon the house off at first. "They didn't tell me what had happened." Two sections of Northallerton Road were closed off as well as part of Blencathra Close but the cordons were later removed.
