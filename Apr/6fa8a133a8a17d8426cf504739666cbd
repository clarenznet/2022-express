Ronnie O'Sullivan will be eyeing a seventh World Snooker Championship title, with the 2022 instalment of the famous tournament taking place over the next few weeks. The tournament is at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield and will be held from April 16 to May 2. O'Sullivan, who will equal Steve Davis' record of 30 appearances at the Crucible, can also draw level with Stephen Hendry's seven World Championship triumphs if he can win it this year. The Rocket will be full of confidence heading into the tournament, having regained the world No 1 spot after a brilliant season to date. However, O'Sullivan has picked out Neil Robertson as the player to watch. Mark Selby, meanwhile, will be looking to defend his title in his first tournament since March.
