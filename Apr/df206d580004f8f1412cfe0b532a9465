Ukrainian forces have been trying to retake the Black Sea port city in recent weeks, after it fell to Russian troops early in the war. Aleksey Arestovich, an adviser to Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, claimed the artillery strike inflicted a major blow on Vladimir Putin's army. He wrote: "We hit the advanced command post of the Russian army in the Kherson region. "It is bigger than Chernobaevka. There were 50 senior Russian officers there. "Their fate is unknown, but I think it is sad news. The command post exploded for a long time." In March, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, the commander of the Russian 49th Army, was killed at the airport in Chernobaevka, Kherson region. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
