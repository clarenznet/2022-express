Brooks Koepka's fiancée Jena Sims, 33, wowed as she took over as caddy yesterday before the Masters kick off. The stunning actress and model was photographed sporting the classic white jumpsuit at Augusta National Golf Club. She had attended the Par Three Contest prior to the Masters to support her future husband. The beauty pageant titleholder wore a green cap that kept her long, wavy locks away from her face. She appeared in great spirits as she carried Brooks' equipment and even posed alongside him on occasion. Jens’ first starring film role was the lead of Cassie in Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader and has also appeared in Last Vegas, Kill the Messenger, 3-Headed Shark Attack and American Beach House. Her TV appearances include Entourage, Dexter and One Tree Hill.
