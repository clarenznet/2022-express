Eloise May woke up in the middle of the night because of severe pain in her arm and chest. Initially, she thought that the pain was coming from a horse riding injury she’d sustained, or from the effects of alcohol as she had returned home drunk. But it turned out she was suffering from an aggressive form of cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and she received the devastating diagnosis in February. She said that she had "absolutely no idea" about her cancer, until she saw the "little white worms", as the samples of the tumour taken for biopsy resembled. The huge tumour was compressing almost a third of the vein returning blood from her brain to her heart. Now, she is halfway through an intensive course of chemotherapy at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. If this treatment is successful, the doctors believe she won't have to undergo radiotherapy. Unfortunately, Eloise was forced to defer her studies at university and move back home to Shropshire. The third-year sport and exercise student of Liverpool John Moores University told the Liverpool Echo how her life has changed since then. She said: "The social life that I did have is basically non-existent. “It's quite difficult because obviously I'm seeing everyone finishing their dissertations and graduating and I'm like, 'That should be me', but there's always next year." Eloise explained: "My life as I knew it, being a student, living in a student house, has been completely ripped from under my feet.” She appears positive although she has lost her hair, which was, she said, "the worst thing in the world". And she said: "There is always so much good in the world that you need to look for, and you need to appreciate the little things in life, like waking up in the morning having hair. “If times do get cr**, you definitely have to step up yourself, but equally, there are going to be a lot of people and support that you don't even know are there, that's going to rally around you, so it's never quite as bad as it seems."
