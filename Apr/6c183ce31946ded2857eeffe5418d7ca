The hike in National Insurance rates and increasing the minimum threshold means Britons will see a range of different outcomes that many did not prepare for. Struggling households should be well aware of how the changes will affect their pockets in the coming months in order to properly budget.   The National Insurance rate will increase this month by 1.25 percentage points, thrusting the majority of Britons into a 13.25 percent tax bill. However, a vital thing to note is that this rise is meant to be temporary. In April 2023, the National insurance rate is due to drop back down to its current rate with the 1.25 percent switching to a new Health and Social Care levy. This levy is a first in the eye of taxes as it will be implemented on working Britons over the state pension age, unlike National Insurance.

The economic impact of the crisis in Ukraine is also continuing to unfold. Many hoped because of the cost of living crunch that the Chancellor would suspend or even scrap the rise in the statement. Instead, he implemented a different form of relief and announced the threshold would rise in line with income tax.  He said: “From July, people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying any income tax or National Insurance." It is estimated that 30 million people will benefit from this change at roughly £330 per year. However, a gap in the changes is the fact Britons earning less than £12,570 will still have to pay the increased rate of National Insurance until June. What to expect in April: National Insurance rates will increase by 1.25 percentage points.  Employees earning between £184 to £967 per week, or £797 to £4,189 per month will have 13.25 percent liability. Those with a yearly salary over £50,000 will find an additional £505 on their tax bill as the rate rises to 3.25 percent. This is known as class one National Insurance and must be paid by all workers over the age of 16 but under the state pension age. Workers over the state pension age will only pay 1.25 percent on their earnings.  What to expect in June: The National Insurance threshold will match the income tax threshold of £12,570 meaning workers earning less than this per year will not have to pay either tax. This £3,000 rise will reportedly result in a £6billion tax cut for millions, worth roughly £330 per year. The threshold rise and rate rise combined will see lower earners better off, with someone earning £25,000 seeing a £1,656 annual National Insurance bill instead of the previous £1,825. However, higher earners will not greatly benefit from the threshold rise and will likely suffer the brunt of the rate rise, with annual contributions on a £50,000 salary jumping from £4,852 to £4,968.
