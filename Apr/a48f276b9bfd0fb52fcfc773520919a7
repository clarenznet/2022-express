The ITV talent contest All Star Musicals pits celebrities against each other as they perform some of the biggest and most well-known show tunes from the West End and Broadway. Helming the competition was the musical star and actor John Barrowman. However, the all-singing host didn't win over every viewer of the show, with many taking to social media to share their disdain. With John Barrowman as the host, the judging panel was made up of musical veterans Elaine Paige, Samantha Barks and Trevor Dion Nicholas. As well as appearing in many musicals, John starred as Captain Jack Harkness in Doctor Who and Malcolm Merlyn in the Arrowverse show Arrow and its many spin-offs. The star made headlines last year due to his off-screen antics, where he said that he participated in “tomfoolery” on the sets of BBC shows Doctor Who and Torchwood. Having been accused of exposing himself to his Doctor Who and Torchwood former colleagues, he stepped back from judging on ITV's Dancing on Ice last year.

Musical lover Sarah Kutschera enjoyed everything about the show apart from one thing. She commented: "If they're going to do more episodes/series of this show, could they please get someone other than John effing Barrowman to present it? "He's currently the only fly in the ointment #AllStarMusicals." (sic) Wayne Tavit echoed those who switched the channel and said: "Puts the tele on. Sees #AllStarMusicals. Turns tele back off."
