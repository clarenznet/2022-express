A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has confirmed the royal couple visited the Queen and Prince Charles in Windsor on Thursday, but William and Kate were noticeably absent. Royal expert Robert Jobson says that it is "significant" his brother and sister-in-law were not involved in the meeting. He told the Mirror: "Significantly, Prince William and Catherine were not involved in these ‘clear the air’ chats. "Hopefully, in time the royal brothers too can break bread and end this new war of the Wales’s, which is in danger of turning into one of the fictional soap style dramas Meghan used to star in. "For William to do that, however, Harry will have to show that he (and his team of PR image gurus and advisers) can keep their counsel at this early and delicate stage. "If not, this promising development would all have been for nothing." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
