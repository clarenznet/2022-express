The classic novel, in three hard cover volumes, is in remarkably good condition for its age. It was one of 1,500 printed during the novel's first run in 1813.  It sold for £70,000, with fees boosting the final figure paid by the British collector - who bid over double the £40,000 estimate. Max Hasler, at London-based Forum Auctions, said: "We expected it to do well, but it went higher than we thought."
