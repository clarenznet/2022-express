Sqn Ldr Arthur Scarf took off from a base in Malaya in December 1941 on a raid, just as Japanese attackers blew up all his comrades' planes. He carried on with his task but the Bristol Blenheim was shot by enemy pilots. Badly injured, he landed in a field at Alor Setar. His pregnant nurse wife Sally gave blood in hospital as Sqn Ldr Scarf, 28, told her: "Don't worry, chin up." But he died soon after, and was awarded a VC after the Second World War ended. Spink of London will sell the VC and his other medals for his descendants on April 27.
