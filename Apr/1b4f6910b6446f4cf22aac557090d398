Conor Gallagher should leave Chelsea again this summer - either on loan or on a permanent deal - according to former Blues striker Carlton Cole. Gallagher has excelled while on loan at Crystal Palace this season and Cole believes he should move again for the benefit of his career. The 22-year-old has eight goals and three assists to his name in his first campaign in the Premier League. His performances have led to call-ups to the last two England squads and he has already played three times under Gareth Southgate. Gallagher has been at Chelsea since the age of eight but is yet to make a first-team appearance for the Blues. Chelsea are in the middle of a hugely uncertain time as the club attempt to push through a sale following the sanctions placed on their current owner Roman Abramovich. Cole reckons Gallagher must just focus on being at a club where he will play regularly. And he thinks Palace is the right place for him again next season.

So it's going to be a reset button for Chelsea. "But for him personally, I'd just want to carry on playing, just carry on playing. I would stay [at Palace] yeah, I would stay.

Whether they go left or right, or they stay or do they twist. For him, I feel he's going to have to twist." Palace brushed aside Arsenal 3-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday. And Cole was impressed with how Patrick Vieira has got his team playing, especially Gallagher.  He added: "Vieira's got them singing from the same hymn sheet. When you look at what he's got assembled there and the way he's got the team spirit. "He's got people like Conor Gallagher. You see him running past the striker, going to close down the goalkeeper. "You can't buy that sort of effort, especially when you've got someone as talented as him. When you've got someone as talented as that working his socks off, that just bodes confidence for the rest of the team."  Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport?
