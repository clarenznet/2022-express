And after a fiercely fought election, the 44-year-old centrist told a victory rally under the Eiffel Tower that he knew France was "full of anger and division", pledging: "Nobody will be left by the wayside."  He said: "I know a lot of people voted for me tonight, not because of my ideals, but to block the far-Right." When his supporters jeered at the mention of opponent Marine Le Pen, he asked them to stop. He said he "thought of Ms Le Pen and her supporters", adding: "I am no longer the candidate for a party. I'm everyone's President." "I understand the anger that prompted people to vote far-Right. That will be my responsibility." He won with a 58.8 percent share of the vote, according to exit polls, although the turnout was just 72 percent - the lowest since 1969. He is the first French president in 20 years to win a second term. Ms Le Pen, 53, and her National Rally party's 41.2 percent increased her share of the vote since 2017, when Mr Macron got a landslide 66 percent. Mr Macron arrived at the Tower as Beethoven's Ode to Joy - the EU anthem - blasted out of speakers. He held hands with his wife, 69-year-old Brigitte, as supporters chanted: "Five more years!" Conceding defeat, Ms Le Pen told supporters: "We could have seen a great wind of freedom sweeping across this country, but the French people have said otherwise." Last night Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: "Congratulations on your reelection as President of France. France is one of our closest and most important allies. I look forward to continuing to work together on the issues which matter most to our two countries and to the world." Mr Macron now hopes to go on to become de-facto leader of the European Union, following the retirement of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He will also be braced for more rows with the British over the migrant boat crisis and English Channel fishing rights.
