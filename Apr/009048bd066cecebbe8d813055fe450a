The Lifetime Allowance (LTA) is something Britons must be aware of as they save for retirement. Breaching the allowance could lead to a financial penalty. The LTA caps the tax-free amount Britons can save towards retirement in their lifetime. It is set at a level of £1,073,100. People who save more than their allowance may face a tax charge of up to 55 percent on the excess amounts.
