Hankey, 54, was charged in relation to an incident in Cheshire in September last year, police said. The two-time World Professional Darts champion, from Stokeon-Trent, has been released on bail and is set to appear at Warrington magistrates court on Wednesday. Hankey, whose nickname is The Count, won the world title in 2000 and 2009. In December, Hankey had withdrawn from the World Seniors Darts Championship, held in February.
