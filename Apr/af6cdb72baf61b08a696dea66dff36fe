Officials said that Allwyn, owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komarek, was the preferred applicant to take on the venture in 2024 after three firms challenged Camelot's 30-year reign. Camelot has filed a High Court claim and chief executive Nigel Railton declared it "firmly believes that the Gambling Commission has got this decision badly wrong". He said that despite lengthy correspondence, the Commission had "failed to provide a satisfactory" reply. "Irrespective of Camelot's dual roles as current operator and applicant for the next National Lottery licence, the competition is one of the largest UK Government-sponsored procurements and the process deserves independent scrutiny." Mr Railton added: "More than 1,000 Camelot employees work tirelessly to successfully operate the National Lottery under the current licence. At the very least, they are owed a proper explanation."  The Gambling Commission said the selection of Allwyn followed "a fair, open and robust competition". Owner Mr Komarek, 53, made much of his Â£5.9billion fortune in oil and gas. The father of four lives in Switzerland with his second wife Stepanka, 45. Camelot is expected to claim that a "risk factor" discount applied by the regulator to rival bidders' projections of how much each would raise for good causes was later dropped - and Allwyn allegedly predicted billions of pounds more than Camelot. Such a court battle would prevent Allwyn from signing the contract to run the National Lottery.
