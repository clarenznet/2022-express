Laura, 45, will be taking over the BBC’s Sunday morning politics show, which was famously presented by Andrew Marr before he announced he would be leaving for a job with LBC last year. The journalist will take over from interim host Sophie Raworth, who has been presenting in Andrew’s absence, in September.    Meanwhile, Chris has described taking over Laura’s soon-to-be-former role as a “tremendous privilege”. He told the BBC: “What a tremendous privilege to take on what, for me, is the most extraordinary job in British broadcasting and journalism. “I clamber upon the shoulders of giants like Laura, Nick and Andrew with a smattering of trepidation and a shedload of excitement and enthusiasm. “To lead the best team of journalists in the business on the best news patch of the lot is something I’d never even dared dream of. I can’t wait to get started.” READ MORE...
