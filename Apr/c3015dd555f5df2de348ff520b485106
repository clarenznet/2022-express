Ralf Rangnick has been torn to shreds in the press over the last 24 hours after his Manchester United team lost 4-0 away at Liverpool. The loss further put a dent in any form of hope they had in finishing in the top four - and former Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor has hit out at the German by asking if he got his coaching badges "at Argos."  Goals from Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane put the Red Devils to the sword without any form of reply.

"[Diogo] Dalot is playing left-wing-back, you've got Phil Jones in the team who has not played all season, I mean honestly. Did Rangnick get his coaching badges from Argos? "I feel that myself and new players that have got their coaching badges deserve more of a chance than some of these guys that are getting jobs. That formation and team that he put out there last night, I don't know what he is thinking." DON'T MISS  United sit just sixth in the table, a huge 22 points behind Jurgen Klopp's relentless Reds. And with Chelsea and Arsenal providing their next two challenges, Champions League qualification could be all but over if they prevail without a point.
