On Saturday, Russiaâ€™s RIA Novosti news agency quoted a Russian security source as saying around 20 SAS members had been sent to the Lviv region. The Special Air Service unit's specialities include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and covert reconnaissance. In a statement, the Investigative Committee said it would follow up on the claim that they had been sent in "to assist the Ukrainian special services in organizing sabotage on the territory of Ukraine". However, it is unclear what steps the investigative body planned to take in response to any SAS involvement in Ukraine but Moscow has previously issued warnings to the West not to get in the way of its "special military operation" in the region.
