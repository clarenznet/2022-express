Liz Hurley, 56, has set pulses racing with a completely nude photograph of herself lounging by a pool. The actress shared the sultry snap as part of a tribute to Patrick Demarchelier who died on Thursday. The Royals star posed while lying on the edge of the pool and only just concealed her modesty with strategic arm placements. Liz also included a selection of stunning magazine covers that were shot by Patrick including another naked snap from Harper’s Bazaar in 1999 and another in 2002 which saw Liz cradling her then-baby son, Damian. Patrick also photographed Liz and her ex-partner Hugh Grant for the magazine as well as Liz's campaigns for Estee Lauder, Esquire magazine and the poster for her film, Serving Sara, with Friends star Matthew Perry. The model captioned the tribute in view of her 2.3million followers: “RIP Patrick Demarchelier. I shot so many covers, advertising campaigns and movie posters with you. You were a dream to work with and you will be so missed.” Patrick’s death was confirmed on Friday in a statement released on his Instagram page. It read: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Patrick Demarchelier on March 31st 2022, at the age of 78. He is survived by his wife Mia, his three sons Gustaf, Arthur, Victor and three grandchildren.” Patrick famously photographed Princess Diana and other stars including Madonna, Kate Moss and Beyonce.
