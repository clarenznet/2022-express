Council officials found insects inside and on top of the chest freezer, inside takeaway containers and on chairs at Baban Restaurant and Takeaway in Swindon, Wiltshire. Live cockroaches were even discovered in a large open bag of dried red lentils. Jamal Majed, who owns the business, was ordered to pay council costs of £2,053 and was told the eatery must shut. Swindon Borough Council (SBC) have shared shocking pictures of the bugs. A spokesperson for the authority told Wiltshire Live: "The team, who closed the restaurant after making the obscene discovery, described it as one of the worst cockroach infestations they had ever seen. Oriental cockroaches were found inside and on top of the chest freezer, while they were even discovered inside takeaway containers, which were ready to be used for customers."  They continued: "Cockroaches were also visible on chairs and under the tables of the customer seating area as well as in the drainage tray in the front counter chiller where uncovered ready-to-eat foods such as cut lettuce, onion, red cabbage, lemons and jalapenos were ready to be served to customers. "Live cockroaches were found in a large open bag of dried red lentils, which were on a trolley next to the hot water boiler. Underneath, more than 100 dead and alive insects were found. There were so many cockroaches, officers had to request additional evidence bags." After hearing the evidence on Thursday, a Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Order was issued by magistrates allowing SBC to keep the restaurant shut until officers are satisfied that the safety of customers can be met. The business will have to apply in writing to reopen.
