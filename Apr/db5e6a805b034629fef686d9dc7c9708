Fortnite could be getting some Attack on Titan content soon. Hot on the heels of Attack on Titan season 4 part 2 ending, it looks like some Attack on Titan skins could be heading to the Fortnite Shop soon. This news comes after well-known Fortnite leaker @ShiinaBR revealed some datamined info. The Fortnite leaker revealed an upcoming background for the Fortnite Shop that will be used alongside new skins codenamed 'Rumble'. This is significant as a major plot point of Attack on Titan's final season is 'The Rumbling'. Earlier this month the Fortnite leaker posted: "New shop background for encrypted skins with the codename 'Rumble'". Fortnite fans who love AoT were quick to put two and two together and thought this could be a sign Epic Games are gearing up to launch some Eren and Mikasa skins.  Replying to @ShiinaBR, one Fortnite fan posted: "RUMBLING RUMBLING". Another tweeted: "Maybe some #Fortnite Survey Skins??" One added: "SHINZOU SASAGEYO". And another wrote: "RUMBLING RUMBLING ITS COMING RUMBLING RUMBLING". If Fortnite launches an Attack on Titan crossover it won't be the first time AoT has come to a popular free-to-play Battle Royale game.  Earlier this year Warzone released Attack on Titan content, with a skin released for the iconic Armored Titan. The inbound AoT content should give fans of Hajime Isayama's iconic anime and manga something to keep them busy until the last few episodes launch. The story of Eren, Mikasa, Armin et al will all come to a conclusion in the Attack on Titan Final Season Final Arc. Part 3 of the fourth season of Attack on Titan (which originally began in late 2020) will be launching in 2023.
