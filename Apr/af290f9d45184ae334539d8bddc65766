The M11 has had all its lanes closed between Junction 4 and 6 near Woodford. National Highways East report the closure is due to a "police led incident", and add that it is expected to remain closed for some time. One person caught up in the resultant traffic tweeted there were "loads of police cars" driving towards the closure. They added that they had been stuck in unmoving traffic since 8.30pm. Just before 9pm, National Highways East tweeted: "All lanes are closed on the M11 northbound between J4 and J6 near Woodford due to a police led incident. "Please allow extra time if travelling in area." Drivers are being advised to follow the solid diamond diversion symbol to reach their destination. Traffic is beginning to be turned around and released from the back of the queue. The major standstill comes after a man in his 20s died after a collision on the M11 last Friday, April 8. Emergency services attended but the pedestrian died at the scene. The driver of the car, a 21-year-old man from Wisbech, failed a roadside drugs test and was arrested on suspicion of causing death through careless driving. He has since been released under investigation. Sergeant Ian Manley said: “This is a terribly sad incident and our thoughts go out to this man’s family and friends. “We are keen to hear from anyone who was driving in the area around the time of the incident and who may have dashcam footage of the moments leading up to it.”  Just last week the M11 northbound was closed following a collision. The motorway was closed for 90 minutes from J4 A406 North Circular to J5 A1168 Chigwell Lane (Loughton) after a three car collision. A key commuter motorway, the M11 runs from the North Circular Road (A406) in South Woodford to the A14, northwest of Cambridge. It also provides access to Stansted airport for holidaymakers.
