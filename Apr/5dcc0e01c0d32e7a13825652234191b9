Everton are currently in the middle of a relegation battle after a horrific season, and Tony Cascarino has doubts that their manager will be good enough to drag them out of it. Frank Lampard has endured a torrid start to life at Goodison Park. Everton have been a top-flight team for the last 68 years, but that streak is in serious danger of ending this season. The Toffees are lingering just above the drop, thanks to a chaotic campaign on Merseyside. Lampard's side are currently just three points above the relegation zone, but have two games in hand over 18th-placed Watford. Form has been terrible, and they've won just three games since Lampard took over from Rafael Benitez. This is the former England midfielder's third role in management, after mixed spells at Derby County and Chelsea. But Cascarino believes he's still a "rookie manager", and that his Everton side has been "chaotic". Cascarino wrote for The Times: "Tactically Everton have been quite chaotic. Lampard started his reign with three at the back in his first two games but since then he has repeatedly switched between three and four in defence. When he picked a back four against West Ham last weekend it was the seventh such change in his starting line-up from one game to the next." Lampard is under contract at Goodison until 2024, and it isn't expected that he would lose his job if Everton go down. And Cascarino believes many of the problems at the club can't be blamed on the head coach. "Some things at Everton are out of Lampard’s control, of course," he continued. "Their decisions in recent years have probably been the most negligent of any club in the Premier League. Their recruitment is all over the place, they have taken on various managers with different philosophies and they have ended up with a huge debt. "This is not a short-term problem for the club. Even if they avoid relegation things will be very tough. There is too much wrong at Goodison Park – and they still have a rookie manager."
