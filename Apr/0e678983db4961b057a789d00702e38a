Nina Doran, 52, was desperate to be reinstated at City of Liverpool College after her dimissal on grounds of gross misconduct and a breach of confidence. Her sacking led to mass protests by the college, which is in the heart of the city. Unionised colleagues accused the college of "trade [union] victimisation" last month and Nina, who is a mum, appealed against her sacking. But last Tuesday she was informed that she had not been successful in these efforts, Liverpool Echo reports. Speaking today, Nina said: "I'm devastated. I think I'd been hopeful because obviously it's last chance saloon for the internal processes available and because our arguments were so vast I thought that at least one would convince the employer to reconsider their disciplinary ruling. "I was just devastated. I still haven't read the whole ruling through thoroughly because I can't bear it. I can only read parts in the morning so that I can then still sleep at night. But I just haven't got round to doing it, I've just read the beginning and the end. "The appeal is the last chance internally, then you're on the outside and you only have the external route really."  Nina joined the college in September 1991. Alongside her teaching positions, she was also a representative for the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU) branch at the city college, and would liaise with the UCU’s national office to organise union workers during industrial disputes. The professional says she is now considering her next action with the consultation of union officials. She claims the UCU members at the college will be continuing in their efforts to have her reinstated. A spokesperson for the City of Liverpool College said: "The College does not take lightly the suspension or dismissal of any employee. We take our responsibilities as an employer and particularly as an educational institution very seriously. "Any decision taken to dismiss a member of staff is always a last resort."
