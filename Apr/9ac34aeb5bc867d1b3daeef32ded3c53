Known for her smiling, jovial demeanour, Knight proved more divisive in her politics. She is credited as one of the architects of the controversial Section 28 amendment to the 1988 Local Government Act, which prohibited schools and councils from promoting homosexuality. In 2018 she apologised for its introduction in a BBC interview, saying her intention had been the well-being of children. To some extent, her achievements were outshone by her controversies. She helped secure the passage of Bills on child-proof packaging and the right for British mothers to pass their nationalities onto their children who were born abroad. But Knight also campaigned against same-sex marriage legislation in 2013 and was accused of being anti-gay because of outspoken remarks about homosexuality. She campaigned against abortion for decades, opposing the 1967 Abortion Act introduced by David Steele's Private Member's Bill. An ally of white South Africa, she criticised Prime Minister Edward Heath's decision to sack MP Enoch Powell after his infamous "rivers of blood" speech in 1968. She was born Joan Christabel Christie but was nicknamed "Jill" on account of being a twin and a neighbour calling her and her brother "Jack and Jill". Her father was an accountant and her mother a teacher. She married optician James Montague Knight in 1947 and later opposed the introduction of costs for eye tests. She died peacefully at home and is survived by one of her two children.
