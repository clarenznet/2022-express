We want to hear what you want to know from the ex-firefighter who was unfairly dismissed from his job after delivering a pro-Brexit rally speech. The pro-Brexit campaigner will answer a range of questions on the UK’s departure from the bloc, nearly six years after the nation voted in a momentous referendum in 2016.  Mr Embery last year won an employment tribunal against the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) after being dismissed from his job as a union rep after attending a pro-Brexit rally, a victory which he admitted left him feeling both vindicated and sad at what he terms a “witch-hunt”. Ask Paul Embery your question in the comments section below Mr Embery was dismissed as an official from the FBU after he spoke at a Leave Means Leave rally at the height of the Brexit crisis. In March 2019 the left-leaning activist gave a speech in Westminster in which he urged for the 2016 referendum result to be honoured, even if it meant leaving the EU without a deal.   The FBU argued that the Brexiteer had committed gross misconduct by getting involved with the rally. Since then the trade union activist and Labour Party member has become a prominent voice for Brexiteers, working as a columnist, author and host. He is also national campaigner for Trade Unions Against the EU. The answers to your questions will be published on Saturday, April 23.
