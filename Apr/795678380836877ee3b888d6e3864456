Lorraine Kelly, 62, has been lifting the lid recently on all of her diet tips as she takes her fans on her weight loss journey. The hard work has clearly been paying off, as the presenter took to Instagram yesterday to show off her outfit for her morning ITV show, documenting her incredible transformation. She posed in a red and white skintight striped dress, showing off her petite waist. Lorraine styled the outfit with black stiletto heels and her signature brown waved tresses. She captioned the post: "Todays look @coast - who says you canâ€™t wear horizontal stripes ! Thanks @bronaghwebster @helenhandmakeup." Many social media users took to the post's comments to compliment the star on her impressive figure. Pammymitchell said: "Lovely. How much have u lost on WW. Did u find it easy to follow?" (sic) Nicola_a2380 added: "You look amazing and I really love that dress!" xx_debbieg_xx commented: "With a figure like that you can wear anything. I love the dress!" The bubbly host has been revealing some health and fitness tips on Instagram in recent months to help her fans achieve their own weight loss goals. It comes after Lorraine revealed she crept up two dress sizes during the pandemic due to comfort eating doughnuts and sweet treats. The Glasgow-born presenter said she "didn't feel great" about her new size 14 figure after realising her favourite dress didn't fit anymore, leading her to pursue a healthy lifestyle.
