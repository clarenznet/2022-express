The massive plane first set off from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It then flew in a series of circles around Temple on Bodmin Moor. It is capable of transporting 100,000lb (45,360kg) of weight while flying at higher than 35,000ft. During its tour of Britain, the plane, an RAF C-17A Globemaster III, took a trip down to Cornwall. It was spotted above both Doddycross and Polzeath. According to Flightradar24, the C-17 cruised at around 8,000 feet in the air, and flew at 548 mph. The impressive jet is designed to be capable of rapid, strategic deployment of troops and all types of cargo anywhere in the world. This cargo can include Chinook helicopters, military vehicles and other heavy items of specialist kit to be included. This is thanks to its load-bearing rear ramp and digitally controlled loading systems. After flying for around six hours, the jet left Cornwall and returned to its base. The C-17 was not the first military plane to be spotted around Cornwall yesterday. Two American bombers were spotted in the skies over Cornwall yesterday morning as well. These were Boeing B-52H Stratofortresses, subsonic long-range jet-powered strategic bombers from the US. The pair also set off for their journey from RAF Brize Norton. These planes were built to be able to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions.

The Swindon Advertiser stated that Swindon locals had reported how “noisy” the planes were. Going a little further south, the B-52Hs went as far as Penzance before circling back to the Atlantic Ocean. While it has been supported and upgraded by Boeing over the years, it has been used by the United States Air Force since the 1950s. Earlier in February, a deployment of bombers arrived at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire amid fears over escalating tensions with Russia.
