Midfielder Steve Hodge swapped shirts with his rival after the game and has owned it ever since.  The shirt will go under the hammer at Sotheby's, with bidding opening from April 20. Hodge said: "It was a privilege to play against one of the greatest of all time. It has also been a pleasure to share it with the public over the last 20 years at the National Football Museum."
