Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he felt it 'necessary' to take over the team meeting following their latest defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League. "It wasn't a discussion type of meeting yesterday," Tuchel said. "I gave my point of view that is sometimes necessary. "We take the players view into account but we thought that after the last two games, it's necessary to give our point of view. "We lacked structure in the last game. Normally, that is our big strength. "That was not the case and it was a big problem because we lacked the rhythm of our attacking. "We were not in the places we were supposed to be when counter-pressing and we lacked intensity and investment in defending. This was more or less what we saw. "We figured it out in details. It's not about general critcism, it's about details. I love the players and the group. We can be better together."
