The ship sank off the coast of the island of Santa Cruz yesterday. The Island of Santa Cruz is one of the islands that make up the Galapagos archipelago, one of the world's most ecologically fragile environments. The ship was carrying 47 barrels of diesel when it went down in waters off the coast of the islands that belong to Ecuador. The ship, called Albatroz, was owned by the state-run oil company Petroecuador. The company said a contingency plan had been activated, with containment booms to stop the diesel from spreading and affecting the ecosystem made famous by Charles Darwin. The ship was a scuba diving vessel. The 47 barrels of diesel fuel that it carried have left a "superficial" oil slick, according to the Ecuadorian Environment Ministry.  Petroecuador added that all four of the vessel's crew members escaped the wreckage safely. The Galapagos National Park's official Twitter account said a dispersing agent had been used in the area. This dispersing agent was employed to "limit possible negative impacts on the environment". The diesel ship's sinking comes just months after Ecuadorian president Guillermo Lasso increased by nearly 40,000 squared miles the protected marine zone around the Galapagos Islands.
