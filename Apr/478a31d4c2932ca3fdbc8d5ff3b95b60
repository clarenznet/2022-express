Locals say the barmy health and safety fears saw St Blaise Town Council in Cornwall ban the iconic spring flowers at a play area. The council said it acted after recent play park inspection training. A spokesman said: "We were advised not to have daffodils in play areas as all parts of it can be poisonous…the town council said no more daffs should be planted." "Once the flowers have died the grass will be cut." The council says it won't plant new bulbs but denied claims it had chopped down existing plants. A spokesman for Roselyon Play Park Committee called the situation "preposterous". He said: "There has always been daffodils in the park. It used to be an old orchard and there must have been about 1,000." "Most of them have now been cut down. Are they going to put signs up saying don't eat the daffodils next? It's bonkers." Part of the park is so populated with the flowers it is nicknamed "Daffodil Walk". One local said on social media: "Let's get rid of all the bees and wasps, let's make sure no one ever gets stung by a nettle…cut down all trees!" Another post read: "Probably best everyone just stays indoors from now on then." South West Health Protection Unit confirmed: "Daffodils are toxic, and vomiting and diarrhoea can occur if eaten by mistake. Most people will recover fully without treatment."
