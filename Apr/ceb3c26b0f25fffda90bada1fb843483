If you're a fan of Call of Duty Warzone, then you're going to need to download a new update for April 19. The new Warzone update is already available to download on PS5 and PS4, before launching for Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One at 6pm BST. Update 1.56 weighs in at around 3GB for PlayStation, so it's worth pre-loading ahead of the new content going live. The headline new feature is the addition of Snoop Dogg as a new Operator. After launching on Call of Duty Mobile earlier this month, Snoop Dogg enters the item shop following the launch of the update. "The Warzone and Vanguard Snoop Dogg Operator Bundle will include ten items — three exclusive to Vanguard — and a full Operator progression track," Activision explains. "Rewards across these 20 levels of Operator progression include Weapon XP for Snoop’s preferred weapon from Vanguard, three alternate outfits, and other cosmetic items. "This won’t be the first time Snoop Dogg dropped into Call of Duty, as fans will remember his Snoop Dogg Voiceover Pack in Call of Duty: Ghosts. Snoop’s voice — with all new lines recorded for his very own Operator — returns to Call of Duty in the Snoop Dogg Operator Bundle for Vanguard and Warzone." As you can see from the patch notes above, the new Call of Duty Warzone update makes various gameplay tweaks. "At the start of Season Two Reloaded, we talked about our intent to merge the core and Vanguard Royale experiences into a single, coherent mode. We've now arrived at the final step of the merger, with Vanguard Royale Public Events joining the core BR event pool." The new Public Events include Restock, Cash Drops, Heavy Weapon Drops and Resurgence. In terms of bug fixes, Raven Software has fixed collision issues, clipping problems, and issues with Keyboard and Mouse button prompts.
