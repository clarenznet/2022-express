SkyScan World tweeted: "Royal Navy - Wildcat HMA.2 - #ZZ535 - #HARP0025. Currently Squawking 7700 Over The English Channel." The 7700 code indicates a "general emergency". It typically means an engineering issue with the aircraft.  It is not yet known why the 7700 signal was transmitted. The Wildcat is the latest generation of multi-role helicopter specifically procured to operate from the frigates and destroyers of the Royal Navy. As a ship-borne helicopter, Wildcat aims to provide commanders with a flexible attack capability which can be deployed to tackle a range of threats at sea and from the sea.  Writing for Flightradar24, Ken Hoke, a Boeing flight captain, explained “squawking” is a way of an aircraft declaring an emergency with traffic control, so they can receive on-the-ground assistance. He said: "If a crew resets their transponder to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700), all air traffic control facilities in the area are immediately alerted that the aircraft has an emergency situation. "It’s up to the crew to let ATC know what the exact situation is. It may be an aircraft problem, medical issue, or something else.  "In some cases, a crew may not elect to change their transponder to 7700 (it’s not required). If I’m talking to Chicago Approach and have a problem, I’ll tell them the problem, declare an emergency over the radio and get vectors to land immediately." It comes after Boris Johnson said he was drafting in the Royal Navy to tackle the ongoing migrant crisis in the English Channel
