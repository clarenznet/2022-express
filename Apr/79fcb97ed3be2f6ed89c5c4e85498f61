  Harry Potter author JK Rowling has faced backlash from LGBT+ campaigner and founder of Lesbian Visibility Week Linda Riley after sending out a tweet today. The writer has previously been criticised by LGBT+ groups and fans of her books about the wizarding world for her views on transgender rights.      This morning, Rowling sent out a tweet to her 13.9 million followers, sharing a picture of her friend Allison Bailey marching for lesbian, gay and bisexual rights in San Fransisco back in 1991. She captioned the photo: “Lesbian Visibility Week starts today in the UK. “A good moment to salute the resilience and courage of my inspirational friend.” She then added the hashtag #IStandWithAllisonBailey in solidarity with the barrister.

The lawyer describes herself as a “lifelong campaigner for racial equality, lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights”. She is currently suing the LGBT+ charity Stonewall on the grounds of discrimination, claiming the organisation is “policing free speech via its Diversity Champions scheme”. Soon after Rowling had tweeted out the image, Riley, founder of Lesbian Visibility Week, appeared to be angered by its contents.     In view of her 76,600 Twitter followers she penned: “Wow! I certainly did not create #LesbianVisibilityWeek so that people like @jk_rowling could use it as a vehicle to stir up more hate within our community. “This is a perfect example of #HowNotToBeAnAlly.” She also added the hashtags #IStandWithStonewall and #LWithTheT, which indicates the lesbian community standing in solidarity with the transgender community. The comments section under Riley’s post seemed to be split on her response to Rowling’s tweet. READ MORE...
