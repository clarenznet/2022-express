easyJet is one of the UK’s most popular airlines and many passengers fly with the carrier each year. But which passengers qualify for a free seat? Customers will need to pay for a seat if they want to choose where they sit on an easyJet flight. Passengers that don’t want to pay for a seat will have one selected for them when they check in. easyJet states: “You can choose where you’d like to sit for a fee. Seats can be selected at time of booking, or at any time before you check-in, via Manage bookings on our website or mobile app. “On bookings with more than one passenger, allocated seats must be selected for all passengers on the booking otherwise we cannot allow any allocated seats to be purchased.” READ MORE: Canary islands weather warning as storm hits Lanzarote Customers travelling in a group will need to pay for seats for every passenger if they want an allocated seat. easyJet has three seat options.
