The family of Emlyn Roberts, 69, say he fell during a lunchtime walk and sustained serious injuries. Members of the public found Mr Roberts and phoned for an ambulance. His sister-in-law, Lynn Roberts, said it finally arrived just before 11pm. She said: “You can forgive a couple of hours, even a few hours if necessary, but 10 is just not acceptable.” She said local businesses and passers-by showed “incredible kindness”, bringing blankets and hot water bottles. An off-duty volunteer first responder stayed by Mr Roberts’ side throughout the ordeal. Lynn said: “He’d been waiting for hours and the first responder had been phoning the ambulance people for updates but he was politely told to stop calling." “We could have got him there much quicker ourselves, but we didn’t want to risk moving him. “I spoke to someone and she said, you’ll just have to wait. “I said to her, 10 hours is ridiculous.” Lynn added: “I’ve got to say, the people of Colwyn Bay were incredible.” Sonia Thompson, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, blamed the “very high demand”, adding: “We are deeply sorry for what will have been a distressing experience. “We would welcome contact should the family wish to explore our response further.”
