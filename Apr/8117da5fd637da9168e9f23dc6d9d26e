News presenter Dan Wootton spoke to Just Stop Oil protestor Zach, who was recently arrested after a demonstration at an oil site in Essex. Zach tried to stop a petrol site from functioning by interfering in the running of the oil site in Essex, Zach and 12 others were detained by local police due to the disruptive nature of the protests. Mr Wootton questioned the young boy on whether or not he was willing to put his future on the line for the controversial activism group.  Activist Zach claimed that the future of young people his age was "hanging in the balance" due to the climate change crisis. The GB News host said: "Now Zach is 15-years-old, he is a member of Just Stop Oil and he was arrested actually last week. "After protesting at the Essex oil plant, Zach do we have you with us?" Mr Wootton continued: "Great to have you, now look, what I would say to you at 15-years-old are you really prepared to put this great life on the line for these people in Just Stop Oil?

Activist Zach said: "Yeah I guess that's a really interesting question, Dan. "And I think the most important thing to remember is that the future which you're talking about here, which I think a lot of us people my age kind of look forward to is really hanging in the balance. "And that's not just some opinion that I've pulled out of the air, that's the science telling us the future of the youngest people in our society is hanging in the balance as a result of climate change."
