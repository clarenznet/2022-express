Eva Longoria has shown off her physique to fans while taking a dip in a pool during a trip to Mexico on Saturday. The star wore a tight one-piece as she posed for snaps. Eva looked stunning in the figure-hugging white zip-up swimsuit. The star emerged from the cliff-side pool with her damp brunette locks swept back behind her ears. Posting to Instagram yesterday, Eva captioned the snap: “Don’t go chasing waterfalls.” The caption is a reference to TLC's hit track Waterfalls. The Desperate Housewives actress also shared a snap of herself a day earlier, as she wore a striped, flannel dress, complete with flares. The photo was shared with Eva’s 8.5 million followers. She captioned the post: “Inspiration exists all around me.”
