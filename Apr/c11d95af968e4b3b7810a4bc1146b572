Meghan and Harry returned to the UK on Thursday on a covert visit to Windsor Castle, where they met with both the Queen and Prince Charles. This is the first time the couple has returned to the UK together since stepping back from royal duties in March 2020. The couple came to the UK without their children, meaning that the Queen is still yet to meet Lilibet. A source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex told the Mirror that they will return to the UK "in the near future" with their children. But a source close to Prince Charles told the Daily Mail that the future king is concerned that their return will distract attention from his mother's milestone by creating a "circus". Clarence House declined to comment. Follow below for live updates on the Royal Family...
