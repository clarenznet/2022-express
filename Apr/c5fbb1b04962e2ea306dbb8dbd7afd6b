   Good Morning Britain star Richard Arnold has shared how his ITV colleagues are always “there for one another”. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Richard explained how his co-star Kate Garraway was “eternally grateful” for the support she has received from both her team, and the viewers watching at home.    Richard, 52, opened up about his GMB colleague Kate, 54, whilst presenting at the Ideal Home Show, in partnership with NatWest. Kate is currently providing round-the-clock care for her husband Derek Draper, 54, who returned home from hospital in April 2021 after a year-long battle with Covid that almost cost him his life. When asked about what the team had been doing to support Kate over the past couple of years, Richard confirmed that the presenters and crew on Good Morning Britain are all “very close”. He said: “I think when you've been around your colleagues, as long as we have…      “I mean, even Susanna (Reid) and Charlotte (Hawkins) and Laura (Tobin) and Ranvir (Singh) are rounding up 10 years or so now… Nearly a decade! “And of course, Kate, Ben (Shephard) and I have known each other for well over 20 years. “So, when one of us, one of the team, one of the family, is going through any kind of time that’s challenging, we're all there for each other, you know? “Because we do see each other every day. We're there through it all,” he said of his GMB colleagues.    “And I know that Kate is eternally grateful for the support that she's got from all the viewers,” Richard continued. “And she's been very vocal about the support that she's had from the team, not just the family of faces on screen, but the people behind the scenes as well. “So together collectively, I hope that we're all moving to a better place - particularly for Kate and, of course, absolutely for Derek and the whole family.” Kate and Derek share two children: daughter Darcey, 16, and son William, 12.        The whole family have featured in Kate’s two special documentaries on Derek’s COVID battle for ITV, entitled Finding Derek and Caring for Derek. Kate recently unveiled her beautiful outdoor space in North London on the show Love Your Garden. Speaking about the programme, Richard added: “I absolutely loved her (Kate’s) recent show about her garden and how gardens - if you're lucky enough to have them or, frankly, even just a window box in this day and age - can take your mind off everything. “And it was lovely to see Derek enjoying the garden as well,” he added.      Speaking about his long career as Entertainment Editor on Good Morning Britain, Richard said: “Twenty-five years I’ve been on breakfast television. We celebrated that milestone in January.” “I think we're very lucky to do the job that we do. And I'm lucky to work with a team, a family, of players for as long as I have. “And it's a great honour to actually still be going in and just chatting to people at home. Sometimes I forget. I think I'm in my own living room at home and I'm just chatting away.” The Ideal Home Show, in partnership with NatWest, the world’s longest-running home and interiors exhibition, will return to Olympia London next spring from 17th March to 2nd April 2023.
