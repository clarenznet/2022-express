Ronnie O’Sullivan is bidding to reach the final of this year’s World Snooker Championship and win a record-equalling seventh world title in the process. The 'Rocket' will have a shot at doing so if he can get the better of John Higgins in their semi-final, in a tense showdown which currently remains level at 4-4 after an opening evening of play in Sheffield. Play resumes on Friday afternoon, and picks up after four-time champion Higgins made two half-centuries on his way to establishing a 3-0 lead in the contest. However, an undeterred O'Sullivan won four of the next five frames with breaks of 70 and 54 accompanied by two superb centuries. O'Sullivan will equal Stephen Hendry's seven world titles should he emerge victorious overall in Sheffield, but struggled to get going early on and his stuttering start was emphasised as his average shot time crept over 29 seconds in the first two frames against his opponent. In the other semi-final action Judd Trump dominated a scrappy first session of his semi-final to claim a 7-1 lead over three-time champion Mark Williams. Trump took a nervy opening frame that lasted more than 30 minutes and included a re-rack and went on to make two breaks of 70 before Williams responded by taking the final frame before the mid-session interval. However, 2019 winner Trump would then make three more half-centuries to pull clear, with Williams' difficulties mirroring the second session of his quarter-final victory over Yan Bingtao - which he lost 6-2. Concentration lapses punished the snooker veteran who went about missing routine pots to slip behind in the contest.
