Amazon UK has launched a limited-time only deal on the Apple Watch Series 6, which brings the price below that of the budget Watch SE model. The Apple Watch Series 6 comes with plenty of great features, including a blood oxygen sensor, an always-on OLED display, ECG, sleep and heart-rate tracking, and storage for music. The Apple Watch Series 6 usually starts from £319, but right now you can pick this up for £229 - a whopping £90 saving. The biggest saving is on the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 GPS model, which means you won't be able to send or receive calls and text messages when away from a Wi-Fi network. You can get a Watch Series 6 for £229 in a range of colours and straps, such as the space grey aluminium case with black sport band model or the silver aluminium case with white sport band. Amazon has also slashed the price of the 44mm Series 6 GPS watch, with this model usually priced at £349 but right now available for £259. Once again, this is available in a range of colour schemes such as the PRODUCT (RED) edition or with the black unity sport band.  If you'd rather not pay for a new Apple Watch all in one go, there's good news – Amazon offers monthly payments to help you spread the cost. For those looking to spread the cost of an Apple Watch Series 6 across 12 months, the 40mm model is available for £20.23 per month. If you like the sound of this deal and are thinking of picking up an Apple Watch in the Amazon sale then don't wait too long. The offer is only available for a limited-time only as the Amazon Spring Sale runs until April 13.  Besides the Apple Watch Series 6 promotion, there are plenty of other products available at a reduced price in the latest Amazon sale. Other top tech that can be picked up at a bargain price right now include Samsung smartphones, Windows laptops from the likes of Lenovo, Samsung, LG and Sony 4K TVs as well as wireless headphones from Bose plus much more.
