EuroMillions jackpots come only once a week in the UK on Tuesdays with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The National Lottery has put £90 million up for grabs, an amount that would place winners on the UK's rich list. While the other remaining prizes won't provide as much, people who miss the jackpot still stand to win tens of thousands of pounds. The National Lottery released the EuroMillions numbers tonight at 9pm. The winning ticket numbers are 2, 12, 17, 28 and 46. The two lucky star numbers are 6 and 10.

People need their tickets to match all five and the following two "Lucky Stars" to win the jackpot. But there is a selection of runner up prizes available as well. Those with variations of the winning numbers and lucky stars could win between more than £100,000 to just £2.50. People who miss out on the less valuable prizes can still win a life-changing sum today. The National Lottery also includes an opportunity for one ticket holder to become a millionaire via the "Millionaire Maker". Each EuroMillions ticket purchased for today's draw comes with a code on the back for no extra cost. Every code goes through a machine while the other draw takes place, and the chosen ticket wins £1 million. While ticket holders await tonight's EuroMillions draw, the National Lottery is still searching for a previous winner. The lottery runners have asked people who bought a ticket in Trafford to check their numbers as a £1 million sum remains unclaimed. The prize comes from a Millionaire Maker picked on April 1 this year. The winning code is TVCV 85411, and the ticket holder has until September 28 to claim their winnings.
