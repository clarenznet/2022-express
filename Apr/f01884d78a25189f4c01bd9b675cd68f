Paul Bussetti, 49, pleaded guilty to one count of sending a "grossly offensive" video at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday. Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said he was "horrified" by the film, and sentenced Bussetti to 10 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. He said: "It was disgusting, it was disrespectful, it was abhorrent and it was - by the nature of the charge - grossly offensive. "I suspect it was offensive to almost everybody who has an ounce of decency about them." Bussetti had been found not guilty after a two-day trial but the acquittal was quashed by the High Court. The accused, from Croydon, south London, filmed at a bonfire hosted by a friend in November 2018, and shared it in WhatsApp groups. It sparked outrage when it went viral and made the national news. It was criticised as "vile" by a relative of one of the 72 victims of the 2017 disaster in west London. The court heard there were comments about Grenfell in the footage.They included comments of "Who's jumping?", and "Don't worry, stay in your flats". The defendant made siren noises in addition to his remark about rent. Another person - not Bussetti - made a racist comment, while people laughed. Mr Goldspring said: "No one seemed remotely upset or outraged or embarrassed by the racist remarks." An impact statement from Grenfell victims said: "The reaction was one of shock, horror and outrage."
