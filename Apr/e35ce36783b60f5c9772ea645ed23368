 Her Majesty’s three-year-old colt-bred called Educator won the bet365 Handicap Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on Tuesday. Tom Marquand, the jockey, and Educator pipped High Fibre to the win by a nose during the race.   The 95-year-old Monarch was not at the racecourse to see the win, but her racing manager John Warren was at the event and noted that she would be watching on the television. According to The Jockey Club, Mr Warren said: “I don’t know whether she had an appointment, but she would have had it recorded and she will watch it.“She will be very pleased with that outcome.” The jockey continued to describe what it is like riding for Her Majesty: “I don’t think ‘pressure’ is the right word to describe what it’s like to ride for Her Majesty because, you know, she understands racing, so if anything, it is easier.   “However, you want to ride winners for Her Majesty The Queen, and it’s fantastic to do so. “We’ll have to see if the horse is going to Epsom for the Derby but this is a step forward. Let’s see.” Educator will be racing at Epsom Downs on June 4 as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebration weekend, with the Queen having three horses entered into the race.   It is hoped Her Majesty will attend the event in person with other members of the Royal Family, though this is now in doubt after the Queen’s health has led to her pulling out of royal engagements. Her Majesty has had a profound love of horses since she was a child when she received a Shetland Pony at just four years old.    The Queen is an avid fan of horse racing and has been seen at races enthusiastically cheering on the horses, highly unlike her usual composed public appearances. She had her horse entered as a runner for the first time at Epsom Downs in 1953.
