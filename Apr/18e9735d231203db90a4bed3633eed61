Ray Davenport was a constable with Merseyside Police when he was dragged along a Liverpool street as the crooks tried to drive away. His daughter Jayne Clemson, who has followed her father into the force, said: "We keep the memory alive." On Monday, the father of murdered PC Nicola Hughes launched the campaign for emergency worker medals. Greater Manchester Police officer Nicola, 23, died along with colleague Fiona Bone, 32, as they answered a fake call from on-the-run gunman Dale Cregan 10 years ago. Bryn Hughes wants the Elizabeth Cross to be given posthumously to emergency services workers killed in the line of duty, as it has been for the Armed Forces since 2009. He said: "It doesn't change anything, it doesn't bring people back, but it says to the family there is some recognition for the loss you've suffered." During the incident in 1981 PC Davenport had reached inside the stolen car and tried to retrieve the keys. The 35-year-old father of one from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was dragged along the street and died from his injuries a day later. Daughter Jayne, 13 at the time, recalled: "I remember Friday evening him leaving for work. On Saturday morning my mum came into my room and told me my dad has passed away." Regarding police work, she said: "You are going to be there when people need you most - that's what makes me want to strive to be like him." Her daughter Nina has also joined the police and started work last week with her grandfather's old badge number, 5951. She said: "I want to live up to the name."  Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said posthumous honours for 999 workers was "long overdue". The Home Office said it is "determined" to ensure the sacrifice officers make is recognised. The Daily Express is backing the British National Emergency Services Memorial, due to be unveiled by the Queen next year. The bronze monument will pay tribute to 7,000 people who have been killed in the line of duty in the past 250 years.
