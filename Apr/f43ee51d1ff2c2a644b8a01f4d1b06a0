As Britons gear up for a barbecue Easter weekend, forecasters warn a stormy fly in the ointment will dampen spirits today. However, with the wind and rain will arrive a tropical plume of balmy air pushing temperatures into the low 20Cs. High pressure will build later in the week allowing sky to clear for a glorious sunny Easter. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: “There is a more venomous weather front coming in on Tuesday, and it isn’t looking like a great day. “This front will bring outbreaks of rain but coming from the Atlantic it will arrive with moisture and bring some cloudy conditions. “However, people will really feel the rising temperatures, and we are talking about t-shirt weather.” Temperatures will continue to lift into the Easter weekend which will be drier and sunnier, he added. He said: “The weather will improve from Wednesday, and the cloud will start to break although it will still be humid. “After mid-week we are more into high-pressure territory with clearer skies and more in the way of sunshine. “Temperatures may not be as high as earlier in the week, but we swap the cloud and the rain for drier, brighter conditions.” The steam-bath warmth will be delivered by tropical maritime air as it floods the nation, according to the Met Office. Temperatures will rise through the rest of the week, although the threat of 60mph winds and rain will blight some regions. Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said: “It is going to turn a lot milder through the week as tropical maritime air comes in from the Atlantic. “This is going to set the scene, with mild conditions persisting for a good chunk of the week. “By Wednesday the trend will be for much of the rain to fade away, and after mid-week it will feel drier and pleasantly warm.” A Met Office spokesman added: “The early part of the week will see some fairly windy conditions in the west, with gusts in places up to perhaps 60mph in the lee of high ground.” Northern and western regions may struggle to lose the rain through the week with the south and southeast in for the best of the weather. Temperatures will rise well above average for the time of year, although these will feel muted in showers, according to the Met Office. Deputy chief meteorologist Dan Rudman said: “It’s bit of a mixed picture as far as weather is concerned over the long Easter weekend, although it will feel warm in places, at least early in the weekend. “A low-pressure system to the northwest of the UK will bring unsettled weather to the north with some strong winds likely and rain in the north west, which could impact driving conditions for some. “However, further south it will be drier, especially in the southeast, although there will be varying amounts of cloud. “Temperatures are likely to be above average for the time of year, although low cloud might keep temperatures lower in coastal areas.” Stubborn easterly winds will keep warmer weather from northern and eastern parts of the UK until closer to the weekend. Good Friday should see most of the country sweltering in tropical Atlantic air, according to Weathertrending’s John Hammond. He said: “Atlantic weather fronts will erratically edge in from the southwest, bringing higher temperatures, but also some showery outbreaks of rain. “Chilly easterly winds could well linger across some north-eastern parts of the UK until later in the week. “It probably won’t be until Good Friday that balmier air will have reached all of the UK. “I’m cautiously optimistic that higher pressure will ensure plenty of fine and settled spring weather for a time through the Holiday Weekend.” Netweather’s Jo Farrow warned thunderstorms brewing over Ireland have the UK in their sights for tonight. She said: “[Weather models] show heavy showers and thunderstorms breaking out over Ireland and then southwest Britain and the West Midlands behind the front into the evening.
