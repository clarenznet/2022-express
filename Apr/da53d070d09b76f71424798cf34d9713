The birds turn Bath into a breeding colony every spring, deposit acidic poo on the UNESCO World Heritage Site's Georgian buildings and ruin people's sleep. There is now a public health urgency to Bath & North East Somerset Council's "proof your roof" fightback against the birds. Five herring gulls in Cornwall tested positive for bird flu in February and last month, most of Southampton was deemed at "higher risk" from the virus. Bath's Lib Dem MPWera Hobhouse has accused government advisory body Natural England of a "flippant" attitude. She said: "It simply responds by saying if it's too noisy, close your windows and move your beds." The council is now protecting its Guildhall HQ and 53 of its other properties. The local authority has also formed the Severn Estuary Gull Group, to work with cities such as Worcester and Gloucester. Bath resident Rebecca Roberts said: "We're woken up at the crack of dawn. If it's a warm night, we can't even open our windows." Richard Wendorf said: "Noise, excrement and aggressive behaviour are serious detriments to those who live here and millions who visit every year."
