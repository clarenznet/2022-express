Demi Ellis, 19, travelled around 90 miles to target the high street chains in Birmingham city centre. A court heard the teenager was apprehended in the Bullring Shopping Centre after being spotted on CCTV. Morphe, in particular, told the court how offences such as this affect their profit margins. But Ellis was spared jail at Birmingham Magistrates' Court despite admitting five counts of theft. She was sentenced to 12 weeks, suspended for 18 months, and told to stay away from "friends" who get her into trouble. The offences happened on December 9 last year, Birmingham Live reports. Ellis stole £947 of clothes from House of Fraser, £186 worth of makeup from Morphe, £48 of clothes and makeup from Boots, a further £350 haul from Selfridges and clothes worth £48 from Zara. But Kalsoom Bashir, defending Ellis, said the teenager was honest with police officers, who caught her in the shopping centre. The lawyer said: "She tells me it was her friend's idea to do this." "She was homeless for three months. She was forthright (with the police) and fully admitted the offences saying she didn't have nice things like this, she took the items for herself. "She has since made contact with the homeless team and has a settled address. She has also applied for jobs at Aldi and a warehouse.  Neelam Shafiq, prosecuting, said: "Officers were called to the Bullring on December 9 by security from Selfridges to two females, Ms Ellis and her friend, who had been observed on CCTV in Selfridges, Morphe, House of Fraser, Boots and Zara selecting items and taking those. "All items were recovered and returned to the shops. Morphe expressed the effect on their profit margins of offences of this nature." Ellis, from Stocksbridge, Sheffield, must complete 20 days of rehabilitation activity as part of her sentence and pay a £128 victim surcharge. District Judge David Murray made reference to the fact she had committed a dissimilar offence as a youth.
