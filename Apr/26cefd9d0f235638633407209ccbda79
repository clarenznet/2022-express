Tennis player Ksenia Palkina has been slapped with a 16-year ban due to match-fixing. Six of those years have been suspended and the former world no.163 has also been handed a £75,000 (with £69,600 suspended) fine.  The International Tennis Integrity Agency announced the punishment for offences she admitted to in 2018 and 2019. Palkina is in breach of rules set by the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP). The Russian-born Palkina's suspension is backdated to the start of her provisional suspension (22 November 2019). The ITIA also ruled that providing she does not further break the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program rules – she would be able to resume a career. That will not be until 21 November 2029, when Palkina will be 39 years of age, meaning her career is all but over. Her sanctions also prohibit her from playing in or attending any tennis event authorised or sanctioned by any international tennis governing body or national association for the duration of her ban.
