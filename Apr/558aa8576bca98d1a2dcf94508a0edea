Prince Harry said that he and Meghan Markle were welcomed with “open arms” when they relocated to the US after stepping down as working royals. The pair have been living in California with their two young children since 2020. Speaking to Hoda Kotb in an interview for the Today Show he revealed an insight into his new life.  Harry said: “Home for me now is, for the time being, it’s in the States.” He added: “And it feels that way as well. We’ve been welcomed with open arms. And it’s got such a great community up in Santa Barbara.” Ms Kotb then asked Harry: "So you feel like that's home more for you?" He replied while nodding and simply said: “Yeah.” The interview took place in The Hague, The Netherlands, where Harry is currently attending the Invictus Games, a sporting event for serving military personnel and veterans he founded in 2014. Harry and Meghan travelled to the Invictus Games together and stopped over at Windsor Castle to visit the Queen and Prince Charles last Thursday, April 14. This was the first time Harry and Meghan had made a joint trip to the UK since stepping back as senior royals. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex relocated to Montecito, California after leaving the Royal Family in 2020. They are raising their two children Archie, two, and Lilibet, 10 months in their £11million mansion and are yet to visit the UK as a family. Harry has previously claimed it was “too dangerous” for his family to travel to the UK but said he would like to bring his children. So what do YOU think?
