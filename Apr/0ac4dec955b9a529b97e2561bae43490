Hollywood actor Richard Gere, 72, arrived at the event in a navy suit and white shirt and was accompanied by his wife Alejandra Silva, 39. Prior to their rare outing last night, they were last pictured together at a showbiz event in 2019, for the Tribeca Film Festival at Stella Artois Theatre in New York. Richard's signature white hair was styled in a swept back look, as he smiled for the camera while the couple arrived at the event. Alejandra meanwhile looked stunning in a skintight blue and black printed gown. She partnered the outfit with large tassel earrings, a black sparkly clutch and platform heels. Richard is very well known for his activism and is a valuable supporter of the organisation which raises money to provide meals for those in need. This was the first event the charitable organisation has been able to hold in person since before the pandemic. The Arbitrage actor and his wife have been married since 2018 and share two young sons. Alexander was born in 2018 and his younger brother arrived in 2020. The pair both have children from previous marriages. Richard has an older son, Homer, 22, from his marriage to actress Carey Lowell, while Alejandra has a son, Albert, nine, from her first marriage. The Pretty Woman actor had been a friend of Alejandra's family for many years when the two reconnected romantically in 2014.
