Ms Markle made an application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office last month. The application covers the use of "archetypes", a word which traces its roots back to ancient Greece and first entered into England usage in the 1540s. Archewell Audio, one of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's 11 complex web companies, filed the application in a move which would mean they own the trademark rather than Spotify. The Swedish streaming service reportedly paid the couple £18million in 2020 as a part of the Sussex's Spotify deal. Despite signing the lucrative deal, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have only released one episode, a holiday special, so far. However, the trademark could lead Meghan to face a legal challenge from companies which use the word in their names.

However, Ms Markle's bid to trademark the word comes after the Archewell foundation announced the couple's Spotify podcast would finally debut this summer. "But where do these stereotypes come from? "And how do they keep showing up and defining our lives?" She added: "This is Archetypes – the podcast where we dissect, explore and subvert the labels that try to hold women back. "I’ll have conversations with women who know all too well how these typecasts shape our narratives.
