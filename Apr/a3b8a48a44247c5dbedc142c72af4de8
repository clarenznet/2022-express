The discovery was made on Friday night, after a search was carried out in an area of the Forest of Bowland. Lancashire Constabulary said in a statement that they had been acting on "new information" regarding the possible location of the 33-year-old Burnley mum. Katie, who has two children, went missing from Padiham on April 22.  Lancashire police said they had not been able to formally identify the body, but believed it to be that of the mum-of-two. In Twitter statement, they wrote: "We can sadly confirm that our officers searching for missing Katie Kenyon have found the body of a woman. "Our officers made the discovery last night (Friday, April 29th) in an area of the Forest of Bowland after receiving new information about a location where Katie could be. "At this stage, although we are not in a position to formally confirm the woman’s identity, we do believe the body is that of Katie. "Our thoughts today are with Katie’s family and all of her loved ones."  The search for Katie had originally concentrated on woodland in the Lisburn Forest in the Ribble valley. Over 60 specialist officers from four different police forces trawled through the forest, which is popular with bird watchers and nature-lovers. They were aided by fire service officers, dog teams, mountain rescue volunteers and even drones. Andrew Burfield, 50, of Todmorden Road, Burnley, has been charged with Ms Kenyon's murder. He appeared at Preston Crown Court on Friday and will face trial on November 14.
