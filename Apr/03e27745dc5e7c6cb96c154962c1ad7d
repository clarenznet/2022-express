Neighbours in affluent Sale, Greater Manchester, heard "screaming" and said they saw dozens of people in the street moments before the attack. It is believed an argument happened at a child's party, a row which spilled out on a residential street where the stabbing occurred. Emergency services dashed to the address and rushed the boy, believed to be in his early teens, to hospital. He remains there with non life-threatening injuries, reports Manchester Evening News. One neighbour said: "There was a lot of noise. "It was a birthday party. I couldn't hear the TV because it was that loud." Janet Stonehewer, who lives on the road, said she heard a group of girls "screaming" around the time the stabbing happened. "A couple of them were shouting 'no, no, no'," she continued. "I just thought it was youngsters having a drink but when I looked out of the window before going to bed, I saw the blue police tape across the lane. I went outside and a police officer said there was an incident and someone had been stabbed." Another man said he heard the "hysterical" screams of a young girl behind his home before police descended on the scene. Part of the residential street was cordoned off yesterday as police investigated the attack.  No arrests have been made in connection with the stabbing. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: "We were called at 10.25pm on Saturday 16 April to a report of a teenage boy being stabbed on Baguley Lane, Sale. "The boy was taken to hospital with a serious wound that is not believed to be life-threatening. "He remains in a stable condition as he receives treatment. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing."
