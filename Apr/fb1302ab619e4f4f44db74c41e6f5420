Officers found a 65-year-old woman dead in her home in Haute-Garonne in Occitanie, south west France. Her husband, 64, and also British, was also found dead. The woman’s body showed signs of blows and strangulation, according to local media reports. The man appeared to have hanged himself. The bodies had been there for at least 72 hours when discovered on Sunday. A note found at the scene suggests the husband was experiencing financial difficulties. An autopsy will be carried out on Tuesday to determine the cause of both deaths. The couple had bought their home in the village of Boudrac around a year-and-a-half ago. The couple had then set up a chambre d’hôtes, a bed and breakfast, in Boudrac. The Connexion contacted the mairie of Boudrac as well as the gendarmerie in nearby Montréjeau for further information. The gendarmerie said that they were not able to share any additional details at this stage.
