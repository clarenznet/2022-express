Madonna, 62, and her "toyboy" boyfriend Ahlamalik have sadly parted ways after four years together. Now the Queen of Pop has given her fans some intriguing advice as she showed her hourglass figure in a tight corset. The singer firstly shared a photo of her appearing to record music while wearing a cosy looking multicoloured hoodie. Before stripping off to reveal a curve-hugging look of purple trousers and a black bustier, which she teamed with fishnet tights. Madonna posed against a sign which read: “Don’t do it,” next to a graphic of a lady sitting on the toilet. Sharing the photos, the pop legend typed wisely: “Don’t s**t in a bathroom with low ceilings……………” The ageless beauty looked sensational as she wore her platinum locks down in a straight style paired with large black sunglasses.
