Russian film director and former lawmaker Vladimir Bortko has launched a furious rant on national TV calling the sinking of Russia's warship Moskva a real "casus belli” for all-out war against Ukraine. During the angry tirade, Mr Bortko insisted the 'Motherland was attacked' and demanded Vladimir Putin use even greater military force against Ukrainians.    Mr Bortko told Russian state TV: "Even the fact there is an attack against our territory is casus belli. "An absolute cause for war. "For real, no fooling around, without any...what is it called? What are we waging right now?" "Russia's special military operation," offered the presenter.   Mr Bortko blasted: "The special military operation has ended!" "It ended last night when our motherland was attacked. The host asked: "When you say last night, do you mean the flagship Moskva?" She continued: "What you are talking about war, you mean total mobilisation?"  "Stop!," interrupted Mr Bortko. "I didn't want to talk about the warship because there were different stories. "But you brought it up, the warship Moskva is an absolute case for war, one hundred percent. "It's our flag[ship], there is nothing to think about."
