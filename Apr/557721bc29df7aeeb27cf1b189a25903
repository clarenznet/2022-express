The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) made the recommendation as food production creates a large share of greenhouse gases. Louisa Casson, of Greenpeace UK, said: "Meat and dairy production uses 83 per cent of the world's farmland yet they provide just a fraction of the calories and protein we need." Sustainable diets include less meat and dairy and more plant-based protein, fruit and vegetables. But Professor Myles Allen, of the Oxford Net Zero initiative, said the IPCC was wrong to place responsibility for action on people rather than industry.
