Frank Stewart was climbing into Anthony Davies's van in Farnworth, near Bolton, to try to retrieve the bag when the thief sped off. The pensioner fell into the road after 20 metres and was knocked unconscious. His wife, Maria, 60, also fell and suffered a suspected fractured elbow.  Judge Martin Walsh told Davies, 38, of Westhoughton: "It is only by good fortune that the injuries were not more severe."
