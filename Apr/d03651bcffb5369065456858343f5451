Stanley Johnson said the UK’s leadership “from the front” during the Ukraine crisis demonstrates why Brexit was a “probably a good idea”. Mr Johnson Sr, who voted to remain in the EU referendum, criticised EU leaders for failing to act quickly enough in cutting oil imports or supplying arms to Ukraine.  He told LBC: “At this moment you have to say Europe needs to pull its socks up. “I mean, Germany is saying they can’t cut back on its oil imports. Well, why isn’t the rest of Europe coming to help Germany?” “I mean it is absolutely absurd this this country, Ukraine, which has suffered so much, is now suffering [more].” Mr Johnson Sr added: “I say to myself, in this particular case, Brexit was probably a good idea, because Boris has been able to lead from the front here.”   He said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was “holding up” the EU from “making the right decision”. The Prime Minister’s father said: “You have Viktor Orban up there who is holding the European framework up from making the right decisions.” He also praised his son's decision to go to Kyiv. He said: “I had absolutely no prior knowledge of the trip to Kyiv. “But I will say I thought it was an absolutely wonderful, wonderful example of leading from the front.” READ MORE: Putin's army branded a 'house of cards' as Russian strategy falls flat  Despite a EU ban on coal from Russia, and moves to ban oil, consensus among the 27 EU member countries on ending Russian gas supply has proved more difficult to secure.
