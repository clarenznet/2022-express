Nicola Peltz’s lookalike mum Claudia has been able to maintain an incredibly youthful appearance over the years. The former model currently boasts the same glowy complexion she from as early as 2006. In a series of unearthed pictures, Claudia could be seen wearing an elegant spaghetti strap satin dress. She paired the black gown with heeled sandals and a shiny pair of curtain earrings that framed her face underneath her straight, medium-length tresses. The blonde beauty had attended the Simon Weisenthal Center as it honoured Rupert Murdoch's ceremony at The Waldorf Astoria. In the snaps, she could be seen accompanying her husband Nelson Peltz, as well as entrepreneur Wendi Murdoch, the now ex-wife of Rupert. Claudia married billionaire businessman Nelson in 1985 and ten years later welcomed daughter Nicola, who married Brooklyn Beckham last week.
