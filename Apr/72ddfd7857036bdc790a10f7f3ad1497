As Vladimir Putin’s troops raid Ukraine in an inhumane war, Ukraine military officials claim the next move of the Russian forces will once again put innocent civilians in the line of fire. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Captain Natalia Humeniuk, Chief of the Joint Coordination Press Office of the Security and Defense Forces in the South of Ukraine warned Russia is planning to heavily shell populated areas in southern Ukraine. Ms Humeniuk said the operation will be a “false flag attack” with an aim to flag Ukrainian troops. Russian troops moved equipment near Kherson and fired high-explosive ammo on Ukraine’s cities of Kherson and Mykolaiv to “demoralise the population”, Ms Humeniuk said. The intelligence service of the Ukrainian MoD said on Monday night, Russian forces planted mines in fields across the highway from the city of Kherson to Snihurivka. Moreover, Russians have put blockades in place in the Kharkiv region, restricting the passage of local residents. In an announcement on Tuesday, the Ukrainian intelligence service said “all secondary roads (including dirt roads) are completely mined”. The service also stated that Russian military forces removed all patients and staff from a hospital in Pologi district, near Zaporizhzhya. The Ukrainian intelligence said: “Staff were informed of the dismissal and the ban on returning to work. “In case of violation of the requirement - shooting on the spot.” And they added that mining was carried out inside the hospital. Mines were also reportedly installed around roads and in fields, even in cemeteries in the village of Fedorivka, Pologi district. The Ukrainian ministry of Defence said in an update on Tuesday that Russian troops continue with the blockade in the Slobozhansky direction of the city of Kharkiv. The update read: “The occupiers are trying to fire on Ukrainian troops and critical infrastructure.
