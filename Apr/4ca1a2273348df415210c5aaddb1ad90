Oleksandr and Olena said people living in the port face going through so-called filtration camps before they are evacuated.  Now relatively safe in Lviv, Oleksandr, 49, said: "It was like a true concentration camp." The couple faced interrogation, along with being fingerprinted and photographed by Russian security. Oleksandr added: "If a person was suspected of being a 'Ukrainian Nazi', they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder." "Any small doubt, any small resistance, and they could take you to the basements for interrogation and torture." The couple finally escaped with the help of private drivers. Ukrainian officials have compared the centres to the facilities Russia set-up to interrogate thousands of Chechens, many of whom disappeared.
