In 2021, the DWP published plans to increase benefit payments, including the state pension, Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation. Due to this, claimants of any of the above payments will receive a 3.1 percent boost to their benefit rates from the DWP. As a result of the rise in the cost of living, many vulnerable groups will be looking for financial support in the weeks and months ahead. For older people in the UK, the latest benefit rise will see the basic state pension go up from £137.60 per week to £141.85. Furthermore, the full new state pension will rise to £185.15 per week from £179.60, according to the DWP. Universal Credit and PIP payments will go up by a similar amount as of tomorrow. The pending changes to the amount received from the state pension, Universal Credit and PIP will come into effect as of Monday April 11, 2022.

Speaking to the charity, one woman named Rebecca discussed how the DWP payment increases are not matching the rise in the prices of utilities. Addressing her situation, the working parent said: “My income from benefits will rise by around £24.80 a month. “But my bus fares have gone up by £13 a month - just for me - and food in the supermarket has increased by around £20 a week, not to mention gas and electricity prices. It’s not going to make a difference to my situation.” Dan Paskins, the director of UK Impact at Save the Children, outlined what is at stake for low income families across the country. Mr Paskins said: “A 3.1 percent rise to benefits when inflation will peak at eight percent just doesn’t add up for struggling families. “They now face having to make up shortfalls of hundreds of pounds this year as a result of this real terms cut. “For many, energy price hikes alone will swallow up any extra income. In terms of meeting day to day costs, it won’t even touch the sides. “For households on low incomes this crisis has become unbearable. Parents we work with tell us there’s nothing left to cut back. “They’re being forced to skip meals, turn off the heating, and take on unsustainable amounts of debt. “Children are going to school hungry because food budgets are stretched so thin. A rise that doesn’t even cover a pack of nappies per week when prices are spiralling across the board is tokenistic to those already bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis. “Families need direct support through the social security system, starting with an increase to benefits of at least eight percent to match price rises. “Anything less means a real term cut to families’ incomes and children will always pay the price.”
