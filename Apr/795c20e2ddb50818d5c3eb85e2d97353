The collection, including protective clothing, cleaning equipment, duct tape and a Stanley knife, was found by police who arrested Sophie George, 18, following a fierce struggle with her intended victim. Officers who searched her home also discovered "to-do lists" which included "drive to grave site", "tourture [sic]", and "walk him to site, kill and bury", Lewes Crown Court in Sussex was told.  Lifeguard George, now 20, was jailed for 13 and a half years yesterday, after admitting attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. The court heard after being picked up by the 23-year-old man in his van in October 2020, she insisted he drive her to a location, where she collected two filled shopping bags. Sussex Police said George demanded they drive to a park in Brighton and grabbed the wheel on several occasions. As the man resisted, George pulled out a knife and threatened him and the pair left the van and fought in the street. During the struggle, George bit the man's finger down to the bone as he dialled 999, the court was told.  Police found the chilling toolkit, "all linked to plans to kidnap, murder and ultimately cover up her crimes", when they searched George's bags. Judge Christine Henson described George, of Brighton, as "fixated and consumed by revenge" because she thought her victim had been seeing other women. She added that a pre-sentence report considered her to be "a very high risk to intimate partners if you feel jealous or insecure...it is clear you pose a risk to those you believe have let you down". After the case, Det Supt Jon Hull said: "I am in no doubt George would have followed through with her disturbing 'to-do list' were it not for the victim overpowering her and the prompt response of our officers to bring her into custody."
