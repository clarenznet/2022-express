It’s been a tough time for actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, who lost two people close to her in recent weeks, and the star appears to be boosting her mood with a sun-soaked holiday, posting stunning photos on Instagram. First came Shane Warne, her cricketer ex-fiance who had remained a good friend even after their split in 2013, after three years together. In a devastated tribute, Liz wrote: “I feel like the sun has gone behind a cloud forever. RIP my beloved Lionheart”. In another post, she added: “It still hasn’t really sunk in that he’s gone. “It seems too cruel that all the people who loved him will never have another Lion hug, but our memories will live forever.” Two weeks later, Liz returned to social media for another sad tribute, this time mourning the loss of her photographer friend Patrick Demarchelier, who died aged 78. Liz wrote: “RIP @patrickdemarchelier I shot so many covers, advertising campaigns and movie posters with you. “You were a dream to work with and you will be so missed”. The stunning star was also hit by sad news last year when Steve Bing, who is the father of her son Damian, took his own life. Another blow was the fact Damian was cut out of his grandfather’s trust, losing the £180 million he had expected to inherit. In a statement, Liz claimed this is not what Steve had wanted, and it was the work of his “callous” relatives.
