Conservative Virginia Crosbie says residents should receive discounted energy if a new reactor is built on the Welsh island of Anglesey, in her constituency. It would replace the existing Wylfa nuclear power station, which is being decommissioned. She asked Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to back the idea, telling the House of Commons: "The new Wylfa nuclear plant will bring local jobs for local people. Will the Minister consider discounting electricity bills for locals?" The Government's energy strategy earlier this month set out plans for eight more nuclear plants, to ensure up to a quarter of power consumed in Great Britain is from nuclear by 2050. It follows a dramatic rise in fuel prices, prompted partly by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European gas prices have more than tripled over the past year, and coal prices more than doubled. But five of the UK's six existing plants are being closed down, with only one new project, Hinkley C in Somerset, under construction. The strategy set out plans to begin choosing sites for new plants in 2023, "with the intention that government will enter negotiations with the most credible projects to enable a potential government award of support as soon as possible, including (but not limited to) Wylfa." Ms Crosbie said: "I think discounted electricity bills should be part of a comprehensive package of measures islanders should expect when spades go into the ground at Wylfa. "There is no doubt there must be a community dividend from having this plant on the island in addition to the huge amount of jobs and investment that it brings."
