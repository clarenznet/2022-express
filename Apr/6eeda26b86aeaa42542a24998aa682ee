Frank James, 62, was held by police after a 30-hour manhunt. Ten people were hit in the spree with five critically injured. James is suspected of dropping two smoke grenades before firing 33 shots into a crowded carriage during rush hour on Tuesday morning. He fled the scene but was apprehended in Manhattan's East Village outside an off-licence. Announcing the arrest, Mayor Eric Adams said: "We got him. We got him." Videos have emerged of James discussing violence in posts on YouTube. In some, he talks about suffering from post-traumatic stress and wanting to watch people die "right in front of my face".
