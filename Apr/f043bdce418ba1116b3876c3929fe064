Other side effects such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, feeling tired or unusually weak, diarrhoea, indigestion, farting, and sleep issues may also be experienced. The full list of side effects will normally be present on the leaflet that comes with each packet of medication.  However, if a side effect is experienced that isn’t present on the leaflet, the consumer still has recourse. In the mid 1960s the UK government set up the Yellow Card Scheme. The scheme allows people to report issues with medicines and medicinal products to the MHRA. Once a fault is reported the MHRA can decide whether or not to take action. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic a Covid specific Yellow Card Scheme was launched. Whether this scheme continues as a standalone digital outlet or amalgamated into the wider scheme is yet to be seen. Recently the Yellow Card Scheme was employed when it was found STI tests purchased online didn’t meet official standards. In a statement the MHRA said: “If a product is found to be non-compliant, the MHRA takes action to ensure regulatory compliance.” With regard to how statins are taken the NHS says they are normally taken once a day. However, when and how statins are taken will depend on the type of statin in question. Dosage will also depend on the type of statin. If the dosage is exceeded the NHS recommends contacting a doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible.
