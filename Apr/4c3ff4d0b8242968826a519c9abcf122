Both carriageways of the motorway were shut for hours between junction 26 for Goole, East Yorkshire,Â and junction 37 for Howden in the same county. Emergency services described the crash, said to have happened at around 10am, as "serious". A car and a lorry collided on the eastbound carriageway but both sides were extremely busy as a result. Eastbound drivers were taken off the road at junction 36 and onto local roads through Goole and into Howden to rejoin at junction 37. Westbound motorists were diverted off at junction 37, sent through Howden and back onto the motorway at Goole. The M18 sliproad was also closed to avoid traffic building up, Hull Live reports, so M18 northbound traffic left at junction 6 for Thorne, South Yorkshire, and used local roads to reach the Goole link for the M62. Traffic was backing up eastbound on the M62 to M18 link. A Humberside Police spokesperson said: "Emergency services are currently in attendance at a serious road traffic collision on the M62. "The collision took place on the eastbound carriageway between junction 36 (Goole) and junction 37 (Howden). "The motorway is currently closed in both directions to allow emergency services to carry out their duties. "Motorists are advised to avoid the area where possible."  Video shows smoke billow out of a car at the scene of the smash. It is unclear if anyone is injured in the collision.
