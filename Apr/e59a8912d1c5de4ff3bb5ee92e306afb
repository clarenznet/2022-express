Ramadan begins in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, starting when the crescent Moon is sighted. This year, for some Ramadan will start on Saturday, April 2, while for others it will begin on Sunday, April 3. Muslims spend the month fasting, praying and reflecting, ending the month with Eid al-Fitr. Fasting is undertaken from dawn to sunset by all adult Muslims, with the exception of those ill, elderly, travelling or breastfeeding. Those with diabetes or menstruating can also abstain from fasting if required. The fast is broken twice a day, with a meal before dawn known as Suhoor and another after sunset called Iftar. As the date of dawn and sunset changes, so does the time the fast can be broken. Read More: Ramadan Mubarak: What does Ramadan Mubarak mean and how do you reply? Iftar and Suhoor are dependent on sunrise and sunset, which means as the month goes on the times change. Suhoor gets earlier throughout April, while Iftar gets later.

These are typically rice-based dishes, pastries, plenty of fruits and vegetables as well as meats and fish. Meals are often shared as a family, with variations in dishes and how they are eaten depending on a family’s origins. For example in India, often Mosques arrange free Iftars with a range of foods, while in Iran the meal is more of a family affair. At the end of Ramadan, one of two official holidays is held - Eid al-Fitr. Depending on the country this can last between one and three days, with gifts shared, donations to charity, fireworks and feasting.
