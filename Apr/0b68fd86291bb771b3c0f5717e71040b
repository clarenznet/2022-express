Erik ten Hag has given his biggest indication yet that he won't be available for the Manchester United job until the end of the season at the earliest. The Red Devils have begun their search for their next manager with Ralf Rangnick not expected to be in the running. It appears as though Ten Hag is the leading candidate with reports emerging last month that talks have already taken place. United officials are said to have been impressed by Ten Hag's 'vision and philosophy'. Mauricio Pochettino has also long been linked with the hot seat at Old Trafford. There are just a few months until the summer transfer window and United will want their next manager in place early to get things going. There had been some suggestions that an announcement could be made before the end of the season. But Ten Hag has ruled out any chance of him leaving his post as Ajax boss before the season finishes.

"I can say that Ajax and Erik ten Hag are very happy with each other at the moment." Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique have also been mentioned as potential candidates for the United job. For now, United's main focus is on trying to finish inside the top four with just nine games remaining. DON'T MISS  They currently sit three points behind Arsenal, who also have a game in hand. The two teams do face off in a crunch game later this month, which comes just three days after Arsenal play Chelsea. But the Red Devils also face a tough fixture before that game at the Emirates as they take on title contenders Liverpool. United have had some mixed results of late with just three wins in their last seven league games. Up next is a home tie against Leicester and Rangnick has a near fully fit squad to choose from with Edinson Cavani the only injury doubt for tomorrow.
