London Fire Brigade (LFB) says that eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters were called to reports of smoke coming from the roof of a building in Aldgate, which is close to the City of London. But Station Commander Peter Johnson said from the scene: "Crews are currently investigating steam coming from a generator on the roof of the building.     "There are road closures in place and we encourage people to avoid the area." In a statement on the LFB website, the Brigade said its 999 Control Officers took nine calls about the incident. The Brigade was called at 8.31am with crews from Whitechapel, Shadwell, Shoreditch, Dowgate, Bethnal Green and surrounding fire stations at the scene. The cause is not known at this time.
