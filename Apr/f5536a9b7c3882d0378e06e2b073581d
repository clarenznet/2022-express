The stone property overlooks Port Isaac harbour in Cornwall and has been the focus of the ITV medical comedy-drama since 2004.Â Fern Cottage was rented out to holiday-makers when not needed for filming the hugely popular Martin Clunes's series about GP Martin Bellingham in the fictitious sleepy Cornish hamlet of Port Wenn. The sale details from JB Estates describes the house, which has two double bedrooms and a family bathroom, as an "iconic cottage, commanding an elevated position overlooking the historic village and harbour". The estate agents added: "Fern Cottage is a beautifully presented Grade II-listed fisherman's cottage comprising of cosy interiors. It has off-road parking, a terraced rear garden and stunning sea views from all principal rooms.  "It has a stylish galley kitchen plus dining room with log burner." The house is offered with forward holiday-let bookings. Doc Martin has recently finished filming its tenth and final series, which will be aired later this year.
