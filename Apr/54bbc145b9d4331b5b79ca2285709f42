  Oti, 31, revealed she was moving on from Strictly two months ago, but has already continued her glitzy showbiz career this year by appearing as a judge on ITV’s Dancing On Ice. Tonight the dancer looked confident as she joined her fellow stars to celebrate the best British musical theatre has to offer. Oti smiled for the camera as she showed off her bedazzled dress, which had a plunging neckline decorated with silver sequins that continued in a twisted pattern all the way down the centre of the garment. The rest of the outfit was made of a sparkling, black material that glimmered in the sunlight.  Oti completed the look with some matching silver, open-toed heels and large earrings consisting of several silver hoops. She wore her hair in glamorous curls and kept her makeup subtle, while opting for red varnish on her fingernails. Tonight’s Olivier Awards will feature the five Mastercard Best New Musical nominees, all of whom will perform in the show. These include Back To The Future – The Musical, The Drifters Girl, Frozen, Get Up Stand Up!, The Bob Marley Musical and Moulin Rouge! The Musical. There will also be a tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim, a renowned theatre composer and lyricist who passed away in 2021.
