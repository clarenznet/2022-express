The winner of 22 Grand Slam titles spoke out after therapy to warn similar scenarios remain commonplace in the sport. The US ace's claims come after Olympic cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins said he was groomed by a coach at 13. BBC pundit Shriver, 59, began to work with Don Candy aged nine. The Australian was her coach as she rose to the top of the game and she made the final of the US Open as a 16-year-old amateur. When she was 17 she told Candy she was falling in love and they had an affair. She said: "I still have conflicted feelings about Don. Yes, he and I became involved in a long and inappropriate affair. Yes, he was cheating on his wife. But there was a lot about him that was honest and authentic. And I loved him. Even so, he was the grown-up. He should have been the trustworthy adult. Only after therapy did I start to feel a little less responsible. Now, at last, I've come to realise that what happened is on him." The relationship ended when he sought out a new coach. Shriver said Candy, who died in 2020 aged 91, was not a predator. But she found the affair "stunted my ability to form normal relationships and set certain patterns". She pointed to "my attraction to older men and my difficulties in understanding how to maintain healthy boundaries". Shriver was wed to James Bond star George Lazenby, 82, from 2002 to 2011.They had three children.
