The shooting took place atÂ 36th Street station in Brooklyn, New York City, during the Tuesday morning rush hour just before 08:24am. The attacker, who remains at large, released a canister of gas before opening fire on commuters. Authorities confirmed 16 had been injured, with 10 suffering gunshot wounds and five in critical but stable condition in hospital. While stressing he did not want to be "premature" in assuming a motive, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told CNN: "I think it's still a preliminary investigation. This is terror. Someone attempted to terrorise our system." The NYC Police Commissioner told reporters the incident was not currently being treated as an "act of terror" but would "not rule anything out" in the investigation. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
