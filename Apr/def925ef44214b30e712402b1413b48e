All eyes were on A Place in the Sun presenter Laura Hamilton as she soaked up the sun in a series of sizzling swimsuit snaps. Proving that she still has a keen sense of fun as she enters her fifth decade of life, Laura was all smiles on the beach. Posting photos on her Instagram account of herself "soaking up the fun", Laura showcased her amazing figure in a nautical-style blue and white striped one piece swimsuit. In one snap, the presenter rested on the beach, flashing a glimpse of her cleavage as she posed lying down on the sand. She was posing close to the Hard Rock Hotel, where she has been staying, and getting a much-needed dose of "Vitamin Sea" after putting the cold British winter behind her. The Kent native was looking young, radiant, and a mere fraction of her age as the warm and balmy temperatures boosted her mood. Yesterday she visited the Songkran festival, and she has been darting around enjoying island life on her bike too, surrounded by tropical trees and lush vegetation. Meanwhile, she has revealed that her hotel, located within a lagoon 15 minutes from the airport by boat, is an "unbelievable place for families".
