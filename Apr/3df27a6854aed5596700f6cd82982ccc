Conservative peer Lord Daniel Moylan said it is "time for Boris Johnson to act" after Brexit negotiations stagnated. His comments come after Britain's Europe minister James Cleverly told a parliamentary committee on Thursday the UK and EU had reached a deadlock over the Northern Ireland Protocol. He said: "We have come to something of an impasse, and I don't think that's through a lack of goodwill, and I think it's more through what we regard in the UK as an overly limited (EU) negotiating mandate." Chief Brexit negotiator Liz Truss said on Twitter she had spoken to European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and that the British Government's top priority would always be to protect that peace agreement.
