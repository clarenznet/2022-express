Exit polls, published earlier this evening, have shown Macron taking between 28.1 and 29.7 per cent of the vote in the first round. Meanwhile, Ms Le Pen is set to take between 23.3 and 24.7 per cent.

François Kraus of Ifop said their polls "get a rather exceptional level of reliability." Follow our live blog for continuous updates...
