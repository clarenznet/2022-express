Ministers want a UK Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre in Victoria Tower Gardens, a small triangle of Grade II-listed green space, which is also close to Westminster Abbey.  The London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust however argued the project is the "right idea, wrong place". In a ruling issued yesterday, Mrs Justice Thornton said the charity's case against planning permission succeeded over a 1900 Act that "imposes an enduring obligation" to retain the land "as a public garden". Helen Monger, trust director, said: "This is a major boost for the protection of London parks at a time when they've never been more valued by the public."
