The company told its former ferry staff they were being replaced by cheaper agency workers late last month. The news they were being made redundant “with immediate effect” was delivered via a pre-recorded video call. P&O’s decision was protested against by workers and unions alike, who demanded the “carve up” be stopped. Now, the Insolvency Service, part of the Government’s Department for Business, has announced criminal and civil investigations have been launched. In a statement, it said: “Following its enquiries, the Insolvency Service has commenced formal criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances surrounding the recent redundancies made by P&O Ferries. “As these are ongoing investigations, no further comment or information can be provided at this time.” More to follow.
