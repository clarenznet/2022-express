Tyson Fury could yet have another fight in him against UFC hero Francis Ngannou after comments made moments after he knocked out Dillian Whyte at Wembley - with promoter Bob Arum claiming that a deal would be easy to set up between the two. Fury knocked out Whyte in six rounds under the famous arches to record a 32nd win from 33 boxing games, and remain unbeaten after his dubious draw to Deontay Wilder in December 2018. The Gypsy King, 33, told reporters after he beat Wilder in their third bout that he would retire, although that was compromised when a bout with Whyte was set up late last year. He made the same comments again after beating the Jamaican-born star, although he was seen with UFC icon Ngannou just minutes later in celebration. And after the duo agreed to an exhibition bout, Arum has claimed that a fight would be easy to set up if they both want to proceed with the formalities. “I’m the boxing heavyweight champion, he’s the UFC heavyweight champion. He’s in great shape, look at the muscles on him,” Fury said after the fight. He was joined by Ngannou just seconds later, who said: “We’re going to find out who is the baddest motherf***** on the planet." “MMA gloves in the ring, kind of like a mix up, a little bit different.” The fight is up in the air due to the complications in rules and such that would follow in an exhibition match between the duo. But Fury's promoter Arum has claimed that such a fight would be easy to make happen - claiming that Fury will not retire just yet. “I don’t know what (Ngannou’s) contract situation with the UFC is,” Arum said. “Obviously, it’d be a massive fight, and it should be easy to make. We’ll have plenty of time to talk everything out." The question over Fury's future was then posed to Arum, with the 6ft 9in undisputed champion set to retire after comments made following his win. But Arum refused to believe that retirement would be the case. “No, he definitely won’t retire. Of course not. Are you crazy?” he said.
