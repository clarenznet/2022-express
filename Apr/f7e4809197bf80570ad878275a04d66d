Frankie Bridge, 33, took to Instagram yesterday to share a hilarious video as she suffered a very funny wardrobe malfunction. The Loose Women star showed off her peachy rear in a thing as it stuck out of her tight skinny jeans. Frankie was facing away from the camera in the video and playfully jiggled her rear while wearing a black lace thong. In the background of the video was Meghan Trainor's 2014 hit All About The Bass. Captioning the racy clip in view of her 1.5 million followers, she penned: "Does my bum look big in this? #hardpantsproblems." Many social media users took to the post's comments to laugh at the funny mishap. Donnaida said: "OMG! At least 20 of these views are mine." (sic) Alisondaw79 added: "Thank you Frankie for this honest pants issue and letting us know that your bum wiggles too lol." (sic) Amyshah_x added: "This is my life."
