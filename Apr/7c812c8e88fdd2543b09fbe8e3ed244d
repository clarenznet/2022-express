President Emmanuel triumphed over his far-right rival Marine Le Pen by a comfortable margin in France's election on Sunday. Speaking from her headquarters in the 16th arrondissement in Paris, Ms Le Pen admitted she had been defeated by her rival after the exit polls were announced. Here is what she read to the people of French in full.  Despite two weeks of unfair and violent methods, the ideas we represent are reaching new heights on this election night. With more than 43 percent of the vote, the result represents in itself a resounding victory. Millions of our compatriots have chosen RN and change. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to those who put their trust in me in the first round and to the millions who joined us in the second. In this defeat, I cannot help but feel a sense of hope.  My thanks go particularly to my compatriots in the provinces and the countryside, in the overseas territories, who have put me in the lead. We have not forgotten this France, which has been too often forgotten. We are more determined than ever to defend the French. I am afraid that the five-year term that is beginning will not break with the brutal methods of the previous one. To avoid the seizure of power by some, more than ever I will continue my commitment to France and the French people with the energy, perseverance and affection that you know me for. The great electoral battle of the legislative elections starts tonight. I will lead this battle alongside Jordan Bardella. I will never abandon the French.  Additional reporting by Maria Ortega
