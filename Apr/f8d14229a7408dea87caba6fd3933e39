While brushing and flossing are both essential components of a healthy mouth many people bypass these essential daily habits. Mouth cancer, tooth infections or gum disease are just some of the more serious complications which can arise. Nearly nine in 10 diseases can cause symptoms in your mouth. When caring for your teeth and gums at home, it's also important to watch for new problems in your mouth. They may be warning signs of more serious conditions in your body. According to WebMD, signs not to ignore when it comes to oral health include: Tooth infections are commonplace and often subside over time and with the appropriate at-home care. Occasionally, however, a tooth infection may be accompanied by other symptoms indicating home care is not feasible and a professional is needed. Some symptoms can signal that a tooth infection has become serious. Treatment for mouth disorders varies, depending on the problem. If a mouth problem is caused by some other disease, treating that disease can help. It is also important to keep your mouth clean and healthy by brushing, flossing, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption and not using tobacco. One of the reasons it is important for people to get a dental check-up if they smoke or drink regularly is because smoking and drinking are the two leading causes of mouth cancer. Both of them are carcinogenic meaning they can cause cancer. Meanwhile, there has been a development in how mouth cancer can be diagnosed. Normally a biopsy is used to test for the cancer, but now a new testing method has been created that borrows technology from another deadly virus. Known as qMIDS, it is the worldâ€™s first rapid oral cancer test. Developed by Queen Mary University of London, the test has been approved for use in the UK.
