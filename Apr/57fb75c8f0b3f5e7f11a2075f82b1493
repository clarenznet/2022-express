Andrea Bocelli’s son has been carving out his own solo career since making his professional debut back in 2018, duetting with his father. Now Matteo Bocelli is gearing up to release his first solo album later this year following singles Solo, Close and Dimmi. His latest project has landed this week in a duet with his equally talented pal Sebastián Yatra. The pair have been teasing their new song Until She’s Gone (Tu Luz Quedó in Spanish and Un Attimo di Te in Italian) for weeks. Yatra is a Colombian singer known for his many ballads and famously recorded the Spanish song Two Orguitas for the latest Disney animated classic Encanto. He and the 24-year-old Matteo accompanied their new track with a brand new music video shot on the gorgeous island of Malta. The latter tweeted earlier this week: “We really hope that our fans will enjoy the song because we truly put our heart and soul in the lyrics and the music, especially in that particular moment of our lives. So we hope that this energy will reach you, and will stay with you.” DON'T MISSAndrea Bocelli’s son Matteo Bocelli releases new single Dime – WATCH [DIME]Matteo Bocelli 'excited' but facing 'hard decision' over debut album [MATTEO]Andrea Bocelli’s son Matteo Bocelli performs on Kelly Clarkson – WATCH [MUSIC VIDEO] Express.co.uk spoke with Andrea Bocelli last year and asked him about his son following in his father’s footsteps. He said: “I believe that Matteo is identifying with more and more clarity his own style, according to his own personality and sensibilities. And I believe that his very promising single Solo shows that. As for duets, it is true that the song Fall On Me was a beautiful occasion that we have seized upon as a family, perhaps without truly thinking it through but with great enthusiasm. And the public appreciated the genuineness of the emotions involved. But I also think that my son has, today, wings strong enough to take flight by himself.”
