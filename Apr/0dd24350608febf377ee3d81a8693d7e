Doja Cat, born Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini, put on a provocative display at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Sunday evening. The American artist has been nominated for eight awards, including album of the year. Wearing a sheer, sparkling blue dress, the singer-songwriter, 26, said the rhinestone detailing on her dress was attached by hand. The Kiss Me More singer made a bold entrance at the music awards ceremony in a custom Versace design outfit. At one moment, Doja clutched her breast on the red carpet in a daring pose. The singer accessorised her outfit with a chunky diamond bracelet and drop earrings. On March 25 and 26, Doja posted a series of tweets leading to speculation that she was quitting the music industry.
