By stalling the disease's progression, the inhibitor, which targets a particular protein, could buy time for other treatments to kick in. Researchers, who published their findings in journal Oncogene, believe it could help those with glioblastoma, the type suffered by the late singer Tom Parker of the Wanted.  The inhibitor method is part of so-called differentiation therapy - switching malignant cells into a more benign state. Professor Georgios Giamas, of the University of Sussex, said: "By slowing or limiting the growth of tumour cells, we essentially make glioblastoma an easier target for more conventional strategies. "But as ever, more research is needed to explore this area further."
