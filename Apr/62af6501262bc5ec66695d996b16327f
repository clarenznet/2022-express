Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are currently in The Hague, Netherlands, to attend the week-long Invictus Games. Meghan has already treated fans to a series of stunning outfits, and today is no exception. Meghan Markle stepped out this morning in an ivory or off-white blazer and straight-leg blue jeans. The outfit is in the Duchess’ classic style as she is known to favour a more casual look. She opted for a pair of denim jeans yesterday, April 16, too – paired with a navy blue Céline jacket. However, the jeans she is wearing today are darker and slimmer. Meghan is also a fan of a simple, staple blazer, usually in a neutral colour. The blazer Meghan is wearing today is ruched at the centre and closes at the waist with a slim white and silver belt. This cinches Meghan’s waist and makes the blazer billow out a little, in a slight peplum style. The Duchess finished the look with a pair of nude heels and silver jewellery.  She also carried a pair of sunglasses, which she wore yesterday too. Meghan’s rings today are silver but the necklace around her neck has a gold chain and a silver coin-like pendant marked with detailed engravings. Royal fans were quick to comment on Meghan’s look on social media today, with Twitter user Dani said: “Meghan is unreal.” Carlyn wrote: “Not me running to unearth every jacket and jeans combo I can find in my wardrobe! Duchess Meghan is serving lewks for days!”(sic) Anastasia added: “I think this is one of my favorite outfits. Casual and chic. Ugh, I love it.” Meghan styled her dark brown locks in waves today, and her make-up was minimal. She wore lashings of black mascara and a light pink lip. A little bronzer was swept over her cheeks, but her concealer was minimal – showing off her natural freckles. The Duchess also wore a little eyeshadow in her trademark smoky-eye style.
