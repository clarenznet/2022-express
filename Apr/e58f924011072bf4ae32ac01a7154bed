Hazy green light blends into the purple night sky, punctuated by brighter beams, in the pictures. David Gilliver, 42, from nearby Gartcosh, captured the phenomenon on film. He said: "I was so excited when I started to see the Northern Lights appearing. "It is one of the most exciting moments I've experienced."
