Boris Johnson is facing the wrath of the public and his own party for breaking lockdown rules by attending a party in Downing Street during the height of lockdown. His time in office has been nothing short of tumultuous, after winning a huge majority in 219 on the back of the public’s wish to “Get Brexit Done”. Only three years later, he could be facing a no-confidence vote from his own party due to receiving a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan Police last week. The Prime Minister has continually refused to resign despite the outcry, and Government ministers are publicly backing him to stay in the role with the pledge to continue to deliver the best Brexit for Britain. Members of his cabinet have been lauded for their Brexit credentials - including Liz Truss for her deft hand in securing trade deals and Priti Patel for her crackdown on illegal immigration. But a huge majority of Express readers have claimed he has delivered a Brexit in name only, with 89 percent of 3,310 people polled thinking the Prime Minister is not doing enough to enable a successful post-EU Britain. If Mr Johnson were to be ousted, who would be your pick to replace him and get on with delivering the Brexit the Conservatives promised you?
