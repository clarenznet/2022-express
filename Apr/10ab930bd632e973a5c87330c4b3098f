Elon Ellis-Joynes was just 12 days old when he was set upon by the crazed Chow-Chow-Alsatian cross. The animal knocked over Elon's pram before plunging its teeth around 40 times into his tiny torso. A court heard that the dog had previously bitten one of Elon's older siblings and jumped into neighbours' gardens causing panic. The pet was "banished to the back garden" but in September 2020 one of the children found the beast inside, standing over the fatally injured tot. Last December, his dad Steven Joynes, 36, admitted owning a dog which caused death when dangerously out of control at Sheffield Crown Court. Mum Abigail Ellis, 28, faced the same offence before prosecutors asked for a not guilty verdict. The court heard Ms Ellis had three other children with a previous partner, who is now dead. Richard Thyne, prosecuting, said when Joynes moved into her home Doncaster, South Yorks, he brought the dog, called Teddy. Ms Ellis told police Teddy "became excited when he first saw the baby". The dog has been destroyed. Sentencing Joynes yesterday, judge Jeremy Richardson said it was "a tragedy waiting to happen" and he "should never have kept" it.
