Viewers of Channel 4’s Undercover Boss USA saw the president of the drive-through coffee chain reward Wil, the bean roaster, for being such a hard worker and persevering when times were tough. Undercover Boss USA shows the journey of bosses who go in disguise among their own staff to see where their firm is excelling and where it needs improvement. Wil has a passion for racing dirt bikes and he was grateful that the company was lenient with his schedule because it allowed him to do both. However his dream of racing took a back seat after his parents divorced. He explained that after this, it was basically just him and his sister fending for themselves. He felt as if he had to provide for her, and take care of her which saw him working 40 hour weeks and Dutch Bros.

Extending his generosity, Mr Boersma also wanted to help Wil’s sister. As Wil felt responsible for looking after his sister after the divorce, Mr Boersma wanted to relieve some of the stress. He gifted his sister $10,000 (around £7,800) too which she could put towards an apartment. Wil was “blown away” by the actions of his boss. He said: “I’m blown away about how someone can walk into your life like this. “I’m in shock, but it is the beginning of a new chapter.” Undercover Boss USA is available to watch All 4
