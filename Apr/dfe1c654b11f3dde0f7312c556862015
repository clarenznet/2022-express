Aries is the star sign given to those born between March 21 and April 19. It is also the first sign in the zodiac. Its element is fire and is aptly represented by red as its spirit colour. As for what is in store this week for those with the Aries star sign, patience is a virtue when it comes to love towards the end of the week, and the rest of this month. Astrologers said: “Things are about to get deep when Venus enters Pisces on Tuesday, moving through your subconscious zone for the next four weeks. “As your intuition increases, your relationships get deeper. “However, don’t get so emotional that you resort to impulse shopping or jumping off the deep end. Breathe, Aries. “And while you’re deep in your feelings, don’t forget to use your passion for a worthy cause when Mercury in your sign forms a sextile with Mars in Aquarius on Friday.

As for who to consider as a love match, water signs like Cancer and Pisces are said to “work well now”. As Wednesday approaches, the “Mercury-Saturn sextile” will require a lot from Aries; they will have to be direct and honest. However, someone with this star sign has been advised: “If you’re not feeling it, there’s no reason to waste anyone’s time, but being tactful should also be a priority. Don’t burn any bridges.” Looking forward to the weekend, Aries will be taught some hard lessons in patience. “If someone you’ve been talking to doesn’t answer you right away, distract yourself with something to take your mind off the situation,” astrologers suggested. In terms of what the rest of the month has to offer, Aries has been advised to hold back and give a love match “time to catch up - literally or emotionally”. “Try not to jump to conclusions about a romantic situation until you talk to someone who knows the whole story,” the experts added. On April 14, Aries' “temper is tamed” when Mars pairs with Pisces. For the rest of the month, Aries “won’t be quite as intimidating” as previously. It seems this month is all about learning to be patient, as the pace will slow “even further” when the sun leaves this fiery sign and moves into Taurus season on April 19.
