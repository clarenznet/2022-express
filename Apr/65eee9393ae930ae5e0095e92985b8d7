Amazon could be about to open orders once again for the PS5 in the UK. According to the ever reliable @PS5StockAlertUK Twitter account, Amazon UK could be dropping its next batch of PS5 stock on Wednesday April 27 with a restock time of between 8am and 9.30am expected. If you're hoping to buy a PS5 from Amazon - and haven't tried your luck with any of the online retailer's previous restocks - then there's a few things you need to know. Firstly, and most importantly, Amazon offers "priority" access to Prime customers for its PS5 restocks. So that means if you want to purchase a PlayStation 5 Disc or Digital console from Amazon UK then you really need to be an Amazon Prime member. If you're not already signed up to the service which offers speedy Prime delivery, access to the Prime Video streaming library and more then you can sign up to a 30 day free trial today. Also, you can increase your chances of securing a PS5 console when stock goes live at Amazon by doing a little prep work right now. BUY PS5 DISC CONSOLE FROM AMAZON BUY PS5 DIGITAL CONSOLE FROM AMAZON  With past PS5 restocks Amazon UK customers have had trouble adding a PS5 Disc or Digital console to their basket. However, a way to get round this bug is by adding the PS5 to your Amazon Wishlist. Once stock becomes available to buy instead of heading to the PS5 product page on the Amazon website just go to your Amazon Wishlist. Adding the PS5 to your basket via your Amazon Wishlist gets around the bug which hit users in the past on the PS5 product page.  If you're lucky enough to secure a PS5 order with the next Amazon UK restock then you can also pick up some cut price PlayStation games from the online retailer. At the time of writing, Amazon UK has slashed the prices of popular PlayStation exclusives such as Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, Horizon Forbidden West, Gran Turismo 7 and the Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection.  In some cases Amazon is offering over half off the RRP of certain PS5 games. You can find our picks for some of the best deals below...
