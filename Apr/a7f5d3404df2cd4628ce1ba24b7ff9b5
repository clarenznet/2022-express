Cristiano Ronaldo, 37, posted a moving photograph with his baby girl to his 436 million Instagram followers on Saturday. The beautiful black and white image featured the footballer gazing lovingly at his tiny daughter as he held her in his arms. He captioned the post: “Forever love,” and it received thousands of messages from Ronaldo’s fans and fellow football stars. Among those was his Manchester United teammate Marcus Rashford who shared a red heart emoji, while Pelé wrote: “God bless you!” Ronaldo’s daughter was born less than two weeks ago, but her twin brother tragically did not survive. Ronaldo and his partner, Georgina Rodriguez, 28, confirmed the sad news on April 18 saying that the loss of their son was the “greatest pain any parents can feel”. The couple added to the sad statement that the birth of their baby girl was the only thing giving them the “strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness”. In the days following their ordeal, the couple and their baby girl returned home to their other children: Cristiano Jr, 11, twins Eva and Mateo, four, and Alana, three. Ronaldo shared a snap of the reunited family and said he was focusing on being “grateful for the life we’ve just welcomed into this world”.
