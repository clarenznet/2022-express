The company said it was "recognising Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-ruling monarch in British history, with a Tribute Collection Barbie doll made in her likeness". A spokesman for the firm explained: "The Queen Elizabeth II Barbie Doll is instantly recognisable in an elegant ivory gown and blue riband adorned with decorations of order. The tiara is based on Queen Mary's Fringe Tiara – famously worn by The Queen on her wedding day - and miniature medallions on ribbons are inspired by the Royal Family Orders. "The pink ribbon was given to The Queen by her father George VI, and the pale blue by her grandfather George V." Since 1959, the famous Barbie brands have been loved by young girls around the world.  The spokesman added: "Barbie's purpose has been to inspire the limitless potential in every girl and remind them they can be anything. "That message has never been more relevant than it is today. Last year, the Barbie brand launched the Tribute Collection to celebrate visionaries for their incredible contributions, impact and legacy as trailblazers." The new Queen Elizabeth II Barbie Doll will be presented in a box inspired by the styles present in Buckingham Palace, made from a 3D ornate die-cut border which frames the doll, and an inner panel showing a throne and the red carpeting inspired by the palace throne room.  The box is printed with a crest-shaped logo and a badge commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne. *The Queen Elizabeth II doll will be sold at Amazon, Harrods, Hamley’s, Selfridges & John Lewis starting April 21, 2022 ahead of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee on June 2.
