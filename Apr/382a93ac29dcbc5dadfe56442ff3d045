Air sign Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac. Aquarius is hard to pin down, according to astrology. Those romantically involved should be wary that this sign "may be skittish when it comes to love". Rather, they are more comfortable in a "flirtatious relationship" and can easily find themselves in a "longterm 'friends with benefits' situation". Love, even when they have "deep feelings for the other person", can lead them to feel trapped. A sign that they like to live in the moment, Aquarius may be afraid to plan their future, not to mention with someone else.
