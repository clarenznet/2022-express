El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, was part of an IS terrorist cell responsible for the deaths of 27 people in Iraq and Syria, including aid workers and journalists. A jury in Alexandria, Virginia, found him guilty on eight charges yesterday, including four counts of hostage-taking resulting in death, murder conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organisation. The IS Beatles were responsible for the deaths of British volunteers David Haines and Alan Henning, as well as American aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, British and US authorities say. Mr Haines's brother Mike said that Elsheikh's conviction "brings to a close a nine-year-long chapter of pain for my family". During closing arguments this week, First Assistant US Attorney Raj Parekh said of Elsheikh: "This defendant put the terror in terrorism himself."  After his sentencing, Sudanese-born Elsheikh - known to hostages as Ringo - is likely to be sent to ADX Florence in Colorado, US. The maximum-security jail, likened TOALCATRAZ, houses British shoe bomber Richard Reid, drug lord El Chapo and hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza, among other notorious criminals.The prison's inmates are often held in solitary confinement until their death. After Elsheikh swore allegiance to IS, he and pal Alexander Kotey joined up with Mohammed Emwazi and Aine Lesley Davis - together dubbed the IS Beatles due to their British accents. Elsheikh, who was stripped of his UK citizenship in 2018, has been convicted over a plot that led to the deaths of US hostages Ms Mueller, Mr Kassig, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.
