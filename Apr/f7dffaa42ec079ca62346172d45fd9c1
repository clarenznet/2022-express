Between 25 and 30 people landed at Dover harbour in Kent around 2.30am. Border Force cutter Valiant took 30 more travellers ashore just before 10am.  The arrivals came on a day when four of the Navy's Archer-class patrol vessels and two Ministry of Defence safety and training boats, as well as Border Force craft, were reported active in the waters. The Flightradar24 site also shows a drone flew from Lydd, Kent, over the sea. The Army was deployed to Dover to assist Border Force officials on Thursday, when between 450 and 500 migrants reportedly arrived. The Government has said Â£50million will be spent on bolstering surveillance in the Channel.
