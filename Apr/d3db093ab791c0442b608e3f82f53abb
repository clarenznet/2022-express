Preparations are underway for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, due to take place on June 2, which will celebrate 70 years of her reign on the throne. The large-scale event, which will also bring with it a special four-day bank holiday weekend, will be the next time we see almost all of the Royal Family together. But the burning question is whether Prince Harry and Meghan will be returning to the UK to join in with the celebrations. Tom Bower, a Royal biographer, believes the Duke of Sussex will face the “ultimate dilemma” of whether to return due to the upcoming release of his tell-all book in Autumn.  Mr Bower said: "I think Harry won’t come back because he knows he cannot face his family, and be pleasant with them, knowing what he’s written about them in that book. That book will have a lot of casualties and cause a lot of hurt. It will really deliver." However, the overarching issue for the Prince seems to be more down to safety concerns, due to his loss of paid protection following the pair's departure from Royal life. Dai Davies, ex-head of royal protection, dismissed the Duke of Sussex’s concerns, stating: “Most of [the Royal Family] now don’t get full-time protection or even half-time protection, so the truth is the UK is far safer than most other places.” Prince Harry is currently challenging the Home Office on its decision not to allow him to pay for his own protection when in the UK, but should he let any of this stop him from returning to celebrate with his Grandmother?
