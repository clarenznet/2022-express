Richard will be speaking live from the Daily Express Facebook page tomorrow at 12pm alongside our host Pandora Forsyth. They will be discussing the latest updates after the Queen extended a huge olive branch to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Queen’s grandson and wife Meghan Markle have reportedly been invited to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The Firm and the country will come together to celebrate Her Majesty's historic 70th year on the throne, but Harry and Meghan are yet to confirm whether or not they will attend. Meanwhile, the Queen had to pull out of the annual royal Easter Sunday service after admitting that Covid has taken its toll on her health. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall stood in for her majesty as Prince George and Princess Charlotte made their royal Easter debut.  Elsewhere, Harry attended the Invictus Games where he shared a message from Queen after a secret visit. He recently confirmed the visit in a televised interview with the BBC, where he said: "She had plenty of messages for Team UK which I've already passed on to most of them. "So, it was great to see her and I'm sure she would love to be here if she could.” Keep an eye on our Instagram and social stories for more updates, information and what to expect from these weekly royal specials in which Richard and Pandora will be discussing everything on the Royal beat.
