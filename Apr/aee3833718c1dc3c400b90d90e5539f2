Official figures revealed that 29 percent more electric vehicles were sold in March 2022 than new public chargers were installed. This in turn means that the gap between the number of electric cars on the road and the public charging provision for them is continuing to grow. Figures released by the Department for Transport showed a seven percent growth in public EV chargers in March 2022 from 28,375 to 30,290 devices. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), however, revealed that 39,315 new EVs were registered in that same period. This means 29 percent more new EVs were sold in March than new chargers were installed. Whereas last year there was one public charger for every 16 plug-in vehicles, there is now only one for every 32 vehicles on average.

There are now roughly 45 public chargers per 100,000 people in the UK. This rises to 111 per 100,000 in London but falls to around 26 per 100,000 in the north-west of England. There are only eight rapid chargers per 100,000 people in the UK.

Joel Teague, EV commentator and CEO of home electric vehicle charger sharing app Co Charger, said: “It's clear that public infrastructure alone cannot meet the whole need for the 14 million households living in flats, terraces, and other accommodation who cannot have a home charge point. “The only approach that works is to start by sharing some of the hundreds of thousands of home charge points we already have, then plug the gaps with public infrastructure.” He continued: “There are 400,000 home chargers across the UK – if just 10 per cent of them were rented out to neighbours in flats and terraces helping them to transition to electric without being reliant on public chargers, there would be an extra charger for every one of those new EVs sold last month.” The number of electric vehicles bought in the UK in March alone was higher than during the entirety of 2019. British drivers registered nearly 40,000 new electric vehicles last month. This in turn made March’s figures the highest on record for a single month. The data also marked a 79 percent increase from March 2021 and found that battery-powered cars now account for one in six registrations. The evidence of the soaring demand for battery-electric cars was provided by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. Across all of 2019, Britons bought 37,850 electric vehicles. In March 2022 alone there were 39,315 sales. It is now estimated by some analysts that battery EVs will become the most popular fuel type as soon as 2025. Hybrid electric vehicles also grew by nearly 30 percent to some 28,000 cars, although plug-in hybrid registrations declined by around eight percent. Ian Plummer, a director at car sales website AutoTrader, said: “At the current rate, sales of new electric vehicles will overtake both traditional petrol and diesel sales by 2025. “There was already massive growth in this segment and, if anything, the demand for vehicles is now even stronger as prices at the pumps rise on the back of the Ukraine crisis.” However, increased sales of electric vehicles will also mean more demand for electric charging points.
