While it seems the Prime Minister thought he was safely out of the woods with the distraction of Russia’s war in Ukraine, public outrage has once again mounted against him for flouting the rules in a time of international crisis. But which MPs are backing him, and who is calling for his resignation? Mr Johnson is now the UK's first serving Prime Minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law while in office. The fines came as part of an investigation by the Metropolitan Police into illegal parties held in Downing Street and across Whitehall during Covid lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. Last night Mr Johnson, in characteristic fashion, refused to resign for breaking the law while Brits were locked down in their homes to stop the spread of COVID-19. The Prime Minister has been found out after attending events he denied, on numerous occasions, having any knowledge of their existence.

Nigel Mills, the Tory MP for Amber Valley, said he no longer believes Mr Johnson is "tenable" in No 10. Speaking to BBC Radio Derby this morning, Mr Mills said: "In all conscience I don’t think a prime minister can survive or should survive breaking the rules he put in place and he was on the TV every few nights, reminding us all that we should observe. “We have to have higher standards than that of people at the top. “He has been fined, I don’t think his position is tenable, in my view.” However, today Conservative peer David Wolfson quit as justice minister over the “scale, context and nature” of breaches of Covid regulations in Downing Street. He said in a letter to Mr Johnson it was a matter of the Prime Minister’s “own conduct” as well as the actual events. Less than one in five Tory MPs have so far issued public support for the Prime Minister - but the number still significantly outweighs those still calling for his resignation. They are: 1.
