Demi Rose bravely risked a wardrobe malfunction earlier today when she almost bared all on the ski slopes of Courchevel. The Pretty Little Thing model, 27, posted the risque snap to Instagram as she continues to enjoy her luxury birthday trip to the Alps. In view of her 19.2 million followers, the Birmingham native stripped off as she enjoyed basking in the sun while on the slopes. In the sultry snap, which Demi captioned with a series of snowflake emojis, the model bravely posed on a balcony in not much clothing, leaving little to the imagination. The star had prepared for her ski trip with all the correct sportswear, but had chosen an interesting way to fashion a pair of salopettes. Demi strategically placed the straps of the garment over her burgeoning breasts as she posed seductively for the picture.
