The age-defying actress, 54, dazzled in a custom Prada dress featuring a floral embellished skirt and trend-setting pink feathered shoulders. Nicole and her country music star partner - who have daughters Sunday Rose, 13, and 11-year-old Faith Margaret - posed for snaps at the premiere of her latest movie, Viking epic The Northman. The couple were joined by co-stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Willem Dafoe for the screening at Hollywood's TCL Chinese Theatre. In the violent Viking saga, Nicole portrays Queen Gudrun, mother of warrior Amleth. The historical drama opened in the UK last week and hits US screens this weekend.
