Overwatch 2 beta Twitch drops are launching today, with anyone that hasn't received an email invite yet able to gain access another way. The Overwatch 2 beta began on Tuesday April 26 with Blizzard sending out email invites to PC gamers that had registered an interest in taking part in the test. The amount of invites sent out was all dependant on Blizzard's testing needs, so even if you registered your interest in taking part in the Overwatch 2 beta it doesn't mean you will have got an email invite. This is where the Twitch drops scheme comes in. Anyone hoping to take part in the Overwatch 2 beta will be able to try and get access to the PvP test by watching a supported Twitch channel. Dozens of Twitch streamers are taking part in the promotion which begins at 6pm UK time today. To get access to the Overwatch 2 beta via Twitch you'll have to watch a supported channel for four hours. Popular streamers such as Pokimane, Asmongold and the official PlayOverwatch Twitch are all taking part in the Twitch drop programme.  You can find a full list of all of the supported Twitch channels below. But just be warned this promotion is only running for a limited-time. The Overwatch 2 beta Twitch drop promotion has an end time of 2am UK time on Thursday April 28. For those in other regions the start time is 10am pacific and 1pm eastern on Wednesday April 27 with a finish time of 6pm pacific and 9pm eastern the same day. Explaining how the promotion works, Blizzard said: "The Overwatch Team is partnering with Twitch to celebrate the launch of the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta. You can tune in to specific Overwatch 2 streams during a very limited time frame to earn beta access through the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta Twitch Drops campaign."  They went on to add: "You will be eligible for Twitch drops after watching any participating channel for four hours. Your watch time will accrue no matter what stream you are watching." To ensure you get an Overwatch 2 Twitch beta drop you will have to make sure your Battle.net and Twitch accounts are linked. You will also need to have an Overwatch license associated with your account. Players who donâ€™t already own Overwatch will still be able to access the build through a free trial that will be offered throughout the PvP Beta. If you're lucky enough to get access to the Overwatch 2 beta the good news is you'll have plenty of time to try out Blizzard's upcoming shooter. The first Overwatch 2 beta runs through to May 17. This beta test is only for PCs, but future tests will include PlayStation and Xbox.  6tan, A_Seagull, AAlBaqoni, AceofSpades, Ade, adepththebest, AlexiaRay, Alpha, Anaee, angelxoxo, Angrodtralari, AnneMunition, Aomdi, Arcang3lon, Arrge, Aryll, Asmongold, Aspen, August, Avast, AVRL, Bazzagazza, BeaPlays, Beaver, Beyaca, Bighead, Blizzholics, Blue, Briggsycakes, BroYouWack, Bruninho S07, Bus, CDNThe3rd, Ch1ckenkun, ChangSik, Cheomyeom, chipsa, ChristalRaine, Crayator, crendor, Crescent, cuppcaake, Custa, Daniel Fenner, Datto, Dexbonus, dianamonsters, Dohyeon, DominoJack, Deku, Dragoneddy, Dullachann, Dyrus, eajpark, echoflex, EeveeA, Electra, Ellohime, Emiliath, Emongg, Enyung, Eskay, Eviltoaster, Fareeha, FDGod_OW, Fefe, Fextralife, FindingKyKy, Fitzyhere, Flats, FroggerOW, Fuki, Gale Adelade, Gavi, Geguri, GetQuakedOn, Guru, Hal, Halo, Hammerkick, HighscoreHeroes, hoshimi, Hoshizora, iddqd, imaqtpie, itmeJP, Ivajpro, Izeef, Izgerte, Jake, Jaws, Jay3, JesseSMFI, Jinsei, Jotum, Joystick, kabaji, KarQ, KATIE, Kephrii, Kimjaewon, Kimtongsoo, Kragiee, KristenRae, Kruzadar, Kssarplayz, Lassiz, Last Chance, Leetaejun, LEGDAY, Leia, LemonKiwi, leveluplifting, Lice, linkzr, Lirik, LuLuLuvely, macro, manda_amsbt, Mangojai, Mars, mendo, Merciful, Metro, Mirage, MisSkywalker, ml7, Mr Yee, Namunlbo, Narullsbackyard, Neves, Niandra, nielnieh, Nitrao_, Noserino, Oasis, One_shot_gurl, Oputo, Overpowered, ovileemay, OWGrandma, Pandaren, Phyerx, PlayOverwatch, Pokelawls, Pokimane, Potxeca, Punkdll, QueenE, Restya, Rrmy, RubenSargasm, Runner, Ryujehong, Saebyeolbe, SaltyPhish, Samito, Sesuko, Shiphtur, Siomer, Sisime, Skiesti, Sleepy, Solmyr, Somjuu, Somnus, Sooshi, Star System, Strippin, Stylosa, Summerpie, Sunshinebread, supertf, surefour, SVB, SypherPK, ta1yo, TallNQuirky, Tekkudesu, Teko, Tex, TheDarkness, Themarinekr, thexboxlucio, Toniki, TQQ, Tyr0din, Vale, Violet, W_NTED, Warn, Woogying, Xargon, Xenofly, XQC, XQQ, YBT, Yeatle, YourOverwatch, Yuuie, Yznsa, Zardoide, ZRush
