Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were joined by Alan Partridge (played by Steve Coogan) on this weekend's instalment of the ITV show Saturday Night Takeaway. Alan Partridge is a fictional broadcaster who first appeared in 1991. Taking up residency on ITV as the guest announcer, fans took to social media to share their thoughts on the comedian.  For the penultimate episode of the eighteenth season of the competition show, the presenting duo pulled out all the stops. Stephen Mulhern returned to the show to perform "on-air dares" with some of the BBC One radio team, Boy George and the Culture Club did some karaoke with viewers at home while George Ezra performed at the end of the show with Ant and Dec. Starting off the show with a comedy skit, Ant, Dec and Alan joked about what was in store for the studio audience. However, his comedy stylings and banter with the hosts divided viewers of the show.
