Photographer Henry Dallal was given the opportunity to work for the Queen multiple times and capture her cheerful smiles. He says of his experience with the monarch: “It’s a huge honour and it’s always very special to be within Windsor Castle and with Her Majesty." However, speaking to OK!, he added that his focus is on achieving the best result possible. Mr Dallal said: “At some point, my focus becomes ‘take a good picture’. “My focus becomes, ‘What do I do to get the best photograph possible?’ “In terms of the lighting, the composition, and also, the biggest challenge, is to make sure the four-legged friends are also smiling at the same time and looking at you. “But you never have to tell the Queen to smile." Mr Dallal took a recent picture of the Queen standing in between two wonderful horses on the Windsor Castle grounds, in celebration of the Platinum Jubilee. He said the Queen was very sociable, and seemed to be having a nice time in the lovely scenery. He said: "She was very nice, very friendly, very pleasant, and enjoyed the occasion. “She loved being outside with daffodils everywhere, with the magnolia blossom, and with her horses. "I’ve photographed the Queen before on other occasions, for the Golden Jubilee, the Diamond Jubilee. "It’s always pleasant. It’s very relaxed. We take the picture rather swiftly, and afterwards, she stays a little longer to see everyone and be with her horses."
