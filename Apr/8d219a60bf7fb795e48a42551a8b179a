Millions of people rely on PIP in England, Scotland and Wales, however many are unaware of the freebies attached to the benefit. One scheme, the Disabled Facilities Grant, could see PIP claimants getting up to £30,000 in England, £36,000 in Wales or £25,000 in Northern Ireland. PIP replaced the Disability Living Allowance in 2013. Eligible claimants must have a health condition or disability where they have had difficulties with daily living or getting around (or both) for three months and they expect these difficulties to continue for at least nine month. With £15billion worth of benefits unclaimed each year, campaigners are urging people to check they have received all the Governmental help one may be entitled to. It could mean up to £608 a month from the Department for Work and Pension (DWP) in PIP payments, depending on how the condition affects someone's ability to complete everyday tasks.
