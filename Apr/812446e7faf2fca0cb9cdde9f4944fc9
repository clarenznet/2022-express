Liverpool fans also sang their anthem You’ll Walk Alone. In a statement before the game at Anfield, the club said: “Family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time.” The Portuguese ace and model Georgina, 28, had revealed their loss on social media. They said: “It is with our deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our baby boy. It’s the greatest pain any parent can feel. Our baby boy, you are our angel.”
