  Posh and Becks weren’t the only stars on the scene at the elaborate Sunday brunch after the nuptials, with celebs including Venus Williams also in attendance. Their eldest son Brooklyn and his wife Nicola looked totally loved up as they made their entrance. The pair appeared closer than ever as they socialised with family and friends at the large-scale event, which was held under a huge marquee set-up. Nicola wore a stylish white summer dress with a silver trim at the bottom and a criss-cross design on the back.  The model accessorised with a white ribbon in her hair and completed the look with a pair of white stiletto heels. Brooklyn looked dapper in a cream knitted shirt and a pair of brown trousers, joining his wife as they stepped out both wearing sunglasses. Brooklyn’s mum Victoria wore a long black maxi dress, which she styled with a black and gold purse and some shades. Ex-footballer dad David came dressed in an all-white suit, which he paired with a beige shirt. Brooklyn and Nicola tied the knot yesterday at a star-studded ceremony costing millions.
