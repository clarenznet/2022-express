It comes after warnings of cancelled holidays due to delays in processing applications as demand for travel recovers. A total of 48.9 million passports were in circulation at the end of last year – 2.6 million fewer than at the end of 2019. A Cabinet Office spokesman said Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay met Passport Office officials yesterday, but refused to be drawn on what was said. Home Office minister Kevin Foster said anyone heading overseas this summer should submit passport applications as soon as possible. He added the Government was “confident” it would not need to extend the 10-week target for processing requests.
