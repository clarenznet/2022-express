 Princess Eugenie and other members of the royal family attended the annual Easter Sunday service, as the Queen missed the occasion. The daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York, was accompanied by Peter Phillips and his children. Princess Eugenie and Mr Phillips were joined by Prince William and Kate Middleton. Kate wore light blue, as did her daughter, who held Prince William’s hand as she walked to the chapel in the grounds of the castle. Prince George, like his father, wore a suit and tie.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were accompanied by their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte as they stepped out in the spring sunshine for the event at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The Easter service at Windsor is a staple in the royal calendar.  However, the Queen will not be joining other family members at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, for this year's service. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, who represented the Queen at Thursday’s Royal Maundy service at the same chapel, are also understood not to be attending the Easter Sunday service.  The Queen usually attends the church service on Easter Sunday at St George's Chapel. The chapel is a 14th-century building located in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle.  Crowds often gather here to welcome the Queen before the service begins and afterwards The Queen receives a bouquet of flowers from local children who also attended the service. The Queen turns 96 on Thursday, she reached her Platinum Jubilee in February and overcame a bout of coronavirus after testing positive in the same month.
