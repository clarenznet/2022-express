Nicholas Latifi and Lance Stroll are out of qualifying after an early crash at the Australian Grand Prix. Latifi made contact as he was trying to overtake Stroll on the exit of turn five.  The slight contact was enough to carry Latifi into the wall, destroying his Williams. Stroll pulled off down the back straight after realising his front suspension was damaged. The FIA has said the incident will be investigated by the stewards. Both drivers blamed each other for the crash over the team radio moments after the collision. Stroll said: “Latifi man, honestly, what is he doing, he just hit me man.” Meanwhile, Latifi fired back at the Aston Martin driver, adding: “I don’t understand what he was doing. He wasn’t looking at his mirrors. The car’s destroyed.” Speaking on Sky Sports F1, Martin Brundle explained the incident was just an expensive misunderstanding. He said: “I think Latifi was getting out of the way, letting cars through but there is nothing fast coming. He’s let the Aston through and then as he’s gone to retake that, boom.  "It’s a misunderstanding, a very expensive misunderstanding for both teams. What an expensive shunt.” He added: “Lance deviated from his line and moved over to the right. I’m sure this is something the two drivers will be discussing with the stewards afterwards and see what happens at the end.”    However, the red flag did allow Stroll’s Aston Martin team-mate Sebastian Vettel to participate in qualifying. Vettel crashed in FP3 and his mechanics had worked frantically to get his car ready for the start of Q1. It looked like he would not make out to set a lap but the red flag allowed just enough time to complete the work. The four-time champion managed just one run in the session but was knocked out after finishing 18th fastest. He thanked his team for getting his car ready, adding: “Thanks guys… hell of a job there.”
