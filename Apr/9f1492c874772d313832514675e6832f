The Palace Papers, a landmark new royal biography by Ms Brown, former editor of Tatler, Vanity Fair and New Yorker, has revealed that The Queen could "see how unhappy Harry and Meghan were" but felt "genuinely very conflicted" about the Duke and his wife's decision to depart from the family. The book claims that the family saw the split coming a few months earlier. Ms Brown described their departure as "a necessary end executed with maximum chaos." She said everybody was supportive of them leaving, but they wanted it done in an orderly fashion to set a "precedent" for potential future departures. She claims that Harry made the decision to quit, but the move was made "with acceleration from Meghan." FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
