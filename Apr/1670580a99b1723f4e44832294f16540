The Office for National Statistics found economic inactivity among that age band was at near-record levels, with 1.47 million men in that age bracket now no longer working. It is a reversal of a long-term downward trend. In means 23.1 percent of men aged 50 to 64 are off the jobforce – a figure not reached since 2013. Between December 2021 and February, 51 percent of them had been unemployed for at least a year. Stuart Lewis, of Rest Less, a digital community for people in their 50s and beyond, said: “With the cost of living soaring, we are particularly worried about people who haven’t financially prepared to stop working yet but have found themselves with no choice.”
