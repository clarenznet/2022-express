Jada Lennox (Kelsey Calladine-Smith) has caused quite the stir after joining Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) in EastEnders. The teenage mum first arrived on the scene last November when she abandoned her and Dennis Rickman’s (Bleu Landau) baby with the stalwart. However, the teenager has now settled into Walford life and has sparked up a friendship with Will Mitchell (Freddie Phillips). But, will Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) decide Will’s crush means she has to leave the square for good? In recent BBC soap scenes, Zack Hudson (Jame Farrar) and Martin Fowler (Jame Bye) teased Jada about Will having a crush on her. Jada refused to believe them but brutally shut down the youngster when she realised he had feelings for her. However, official soap spoilers suggest Will will continue to hold a torch for the teenage mum. On the market, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) embarrasses his son in front of Jada. The trader shouts over to Martin and Jada inviting them both over to watch a film.

Later, Honey learns about the mix-up and begins to panic Will may throw his life away over a potential romance. She tries to deter him from liking Jada but will she encourage his crush further? Jada fell pregnant when she was 14 and Dennis, who was 13 at the time, was the father. She wasn’t able to tell the schoolboy about the pregnancy before he tragically died in 2020. Will is now the same age Jada was when she became pregnant and Honey may fear history could repeat itself. Little is known about Jada’s past and her friends outside of Walford. The private character may be in a relationship with someone and could experience a pregnancy scare. If Honey somehow discovered Jada’s concerns, this could be the final straw for the mum-of-two.

Will Honey accept her son has a crush on Jada or will she decide only drastic action will do? Meanwhile, EastEnders fans are divided over Jada and Will’s blossoming friendship. @ZachsMeena tweeted: “Will and Jada’s friendship better not become a romance #EastEnders.” “#EastEnders please don't turn Jada and Will into a relationship,” @EPetite_ urged. @mikepriestley13 wrote: “Jada will never learn. Will needs to stay well away from her #EastEnders.” @BovaryCee disagreed: “I’m thinking Will and Jada could work. #EastEnders.” @Nk3play2 added: “#EastEnders Jada & Will are an unexpected delight! They're gonna get into trouble but I'll enjoy this story.” EastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm.
