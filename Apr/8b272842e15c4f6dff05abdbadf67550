The 86th edition of the Masters takes place at Augusta National from April 7 to April 10 - and there are plenty of different avenues to ensure you don’t miss a single moment of action. Five-time champion Tiger Woods headlines an exciting field, with the American returning to professional golf for the first time since he suffered severe injuries in a car crash 14 months ago. A capacity crowd is expected for the first time since 2019 amid the pandemic to welcome the first major of the season. The Masters is one of the most prestigious tournaments on the calendar, and signals the start of summer for many fans along with The Open, US Open and PGA Championship. Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia has been the venue for the tournament since it began in 1934, and the iconic course is renowned around the world for its beauty and difficulty. The winner of the tournament will bag himself a coveted green jacket. Woods, the 15-time major winner, feared after his crash that not only would he never play professional golf again, but he would lose his right leg to amputation. He has not played since the 2020 edition of the Masters, and may not be one of the favourites despite his incredible comeback.
