The comic, who presents Channel 4's Joe Lycett's Got Your Back show, said 16 to 34-year-olds are more likely to be victims of fraud than any other age group. Joe told a House of Lords committee around one in five under-35s had been scammed recently. But it was indiscriminate in terms of age, sex and class and "anyone can be caught out" by fraudsters. He added: "They absolutely ruin people's lives." Joe called for "more information" in schools as well as lessons on finance to help youngsters.
