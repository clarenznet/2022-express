Demi Moore, 59, wowed fans in the mid 1990s as she appeared on the red carpet sporting a buzzcut. The Ghost actress shaved her head in 1996 for the role of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the war drama film, GI Jane. The hairstyle has since been widely imitated, with many opting to shave their own heads at home. In the pictures, Demi can be seen wearing various chic all-black red carpet looks and giving the cameras a fierce look. However, Demi's former hairstyle was the subject of controversy at this year's Academy Awards after comedian Chris Rock included it in one of his jokes while presenting the ceremony. Chris made a joke about Will Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith - who has alopecia - having a shaved head, while referencing the 1997 film GI Jane. The jibe saw Jada roll her eyes before Will marched onto the stage and slapped the comedian.
