There might be good news for fans of the Sonos audio brand with it thought the US firm could be about to reveal a brand new soundbar that will be far cheaper than anything it currently produces. The new telly-boosting speaker, which is codenamed "Fury", has been exposed ahead of its official release by technology website The Verge. It's thought that, when it goes on sale later in the spring, it will cost around $249 (£191). Although that's not exactly bargain basement pricing it's still far cheaper than the £449 Sonos Beam or hugely impressive £899 Sonos Arc. That much lower cost could make it a very attractive option for anyone looking to boost their Sonos kit without it breaking the bank. Other features revealed in the leak include a compact design that should tuck neatly under your telly and, like most Sonos devices, it will probably sound pretty impressive thanks to a number of speakers tucked inside its shell. It will also link up with any other Sonos gadgets you have in the home for a multi-room experience. Of course, the lower price does mean it might not be as feature-packed as other soundbars from Sonos with The Verge stating that it won't include access to voice assistants from Google or Amazon or include sound-booting tech such as Dolby Atmos. It also appears that it won't have an HDMI port with users connecting it to their TVs via an optical cable instead. It's thought the new speaker could arrive in stores as early as June although Sonos is remaining tight-lipped about its new speaker with the company simply saying “we don’t comment on rumor or speculation.” If the audio firm is going to release this new soundbar in early June then we can expect to hear an official announcement in the coming weeks. Express.co.uk will keep a close eye on any news coming from Sonos and will update this article if we hear more.
