A 330-yard wall of flames swept across 42 acres of the tinder-dry landscape at Canford Heath in Poole, Dorset. Some 100 firefighters spent six hours ensuring it would not spread to a housing estate. Yet dramatic images show how the blaze came within just a few feet of fences near Britain's largest lowland heath. Graham Kewley, of Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, said: "The vegetation on top has been unusually dry." No one was injured but Saturday evening's fire devastated an area equivalent to 23 football pitches. Canford Heath is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to an abundance of reptiles and birdlife. Officials said arson or a "reckless act" are strong possibilities of the cause.
