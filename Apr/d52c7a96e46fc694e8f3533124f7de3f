In a high-profile visit to Kyiv, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia was "brutalising" the invaded nation but was not winning. Speaking in Poland after the visit, Mr Blinken said: "A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin." "Our support for Ukraine will continue until we see final success." Mr Austin said the nature of the fight in Ukraine had evolved so it now needed long-range weapons. He also announced the US would allocate an extra Â£559million for President Zelensky's government and countries in the region. It was the highest-level visit to Ukraine by American officials since the invasion began in February. Yesterday the UK's Ministry of Defence said Moscow's new eastern offensive had made only "minor advances in some areas". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the war had seen Russia lose 15,000 personnel, with 2,000 armoured vehicles destroyed or seized, including at least 530 tanks, 530 personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles. Russia had also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets.
