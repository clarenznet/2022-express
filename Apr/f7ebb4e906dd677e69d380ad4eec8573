Research from King's College London (KCL) adds to evidence that the Omicron Covid strain is less severe. Sufferers were more likely to have a hoarse voice than those with Delta but less likely to develop brain fog, eye burning, dizziness, fever and headaches.  The Zoe symptom tracking app found loss of smell was reported in 53 per cent of Delta cases but fewer than 20 per cent for Omicron. Researchers, using data from more than 62,000 who tested positive, also noted that Omicron had less lung involvement. It also lasted two days less, which suggests its incubation time is shorter, said scientists. Dr Cristina Menni, of KCL, said we are moving away from official "core" symptoms "to a different selection". The findings were published in The Lancet.
