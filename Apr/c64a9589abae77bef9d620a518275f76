The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who will one day be king and queen of Canada, will visit in May. The couple will meet communities throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada's Capital Region and the Northwest Territories. Further details will be released in due course. Charles has visited Canada 18 times, while Camilla has been four times. The pair last toured the country together in 2017 when they met Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and marked the 150th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation. Canada is the overseas country most visited by the Queen. But the monarch, now nearly 96, called time on her international tours a number of years ago. Meghan Markle lived in Toronto while filming TV drama Suits. She and Prince Harry now live in the US with their two children Archie and Lilibet. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex initially stayed in Canada after announcing they were quitting as working royals, before moving to California. Clarence House has yet to comment on whether Charles will visit Harry and Meghan during his trip across the Atlantic. The heir to the throne has yet to meet his youngest grandchild, 10-month-old Lili. It comes as Princess Anne today arrived in Papua New Guinea to continue her southern hemisphere tour to mark the Queen's historic milestone of 70 years on the throne. The Princess Royal and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, landed in Port Moresby on Monday after a weekend of engagements in Australia. They were greeted on the tarmac of Jacksons International Airport by Prime Minister James Marape, and Anne was presented with a garland of flowers before she inspected a guard of honour.
