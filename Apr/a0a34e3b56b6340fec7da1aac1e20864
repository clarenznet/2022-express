Stakhovsky, 36, was born in Kyiv when the nation was part of the Soviet Union. But with the USSR having dissolved in 1991, the 6ft 4in hero represented the nation that regained its independence that same year.  The star competed in eight ATP finals in his career across both single and double format, winning all of them to mark his name as one of Ukraine's biggest sporting heroes. Yet with his country currently being invaded by Russia, Stakhovsky was torn between staying at his home in Hungary with his family or going back to Ukraine to help out in the war. He chose the former in a bid to fight against Vladimir Putin's invasion of his home nation, leaving behind his wife and children for the unforeseeable future. And the star has detailed the heartbreaking moment his family realised he would be leaving their home - admitting he couldn't face the guilt if he abstained from playing his part in the war. “My children were watching cartoons as I was leaving Hungary. I didn’t want to distract them," Stakhovsky said to Inside Tennis. "My 3-year-old noticed me with my backpack. I told him I’ll be right back, otherwise he would start crying. "My wife was mad. She felt it was a betrayal. We talk now, which is an improvement, and I hope she’ll forgive me. It was a no-win scenario. I couldn’t forgive myself if I stayed. "Now I can’t forgive myself now that I’m here. I had to make a difficult choice between my family and my country." Russia began their invasion on February 24, after a weeks of patrolling the border. Cities such as Donetsk, Luhansk and Mariupol have come under intense bombings as Putin bids to invade the country. Sporting stars, such as the foreign players at Shakhtar Donetsk, had to be evacuated from the area after not knowing whether they would have to stay in Kyiv. But Stavhovsky's brave decision means he will be out on the frontline until a conclusion is reached between the two nations.
