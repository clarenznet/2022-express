Jeremy Vine was joined by a number of angry callers who had strong opinions on talk of including health warnings on boxes of supermarket Easter eggs. Listeners rang in to join the heated discussion after Vine floated the idea of having cigarette-style warnings put on the packaging. Pam from Essex called in to say: "Well it's very condescending isn't it really. "I mean can't we have an Easter egg once a year now. "It's absolutely crazy." Vine asked: "But what about people who might have four Easter eggs?"  Pam replied: "Surely we have a choice, don't we? "Well I hear you but then we all pay the bill for the results," replied Mr Vine Pam responded: "But you can't restrict people like that it is absolutely crazy." Peter in North Lanarkshire argued: "Two words: personal responsibility.  'Where does it end?" He continued: "Where do you draw the line? "You would have to continue to draw warnings and continue to do so on boxes of chocolates, family size bags of crisps, because salt is also dangerous in high volumes." Meanwhile, two Cadbury World chocolatiers have designed a monster Easter egg to celebrate the holiday. The hand-crafted egg, which depicts a spring scene including rabbits, a fox and an owl, is approximate in weight to 889 standard bars of Cadbury Dairy Milk. Visitors of Cadbury World in Bournville, just outside Birmingham city centre, can see the solid milk chocolate masterpiece throughout April. "Dawn and Donna are renowned for creating egg-cellent Easter chocolate creations, and they've definitely continued the tradition with this year's masterpiece," said Diane Mitchell, marketing manager at Cadbury World. "We look forward to welcoming visitors to Cadbury World over Easter, and are very excited for all guests to see our cracking chocolate creation in person!"
