Craig Butfoy made false claims to secure and keep a job with BA CityFlyer and the now collapsed Irish regional airline Stobart Air, from 2016 to 2018. The crime mirrored the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio, right, as Frank Abagnale, who pulled off cons worth millions of dollars, including posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, before his 19th birthday. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which brought the prosecution, said Butfoy, 49, was jailed for a year at Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London, after he earlier admitted four charges of fraud. The authority said he had entered false details and altered entries in his flight logbook so it appeared he was more experienced. Court papers also included a claim that in a job application to BA CityFlyer, he falsely said he had flown 1,610 hours as a captain. Butfoy, of Matfield, Kent, was also accused of giving false details on his CV, including claiming he had held a private pilot's licence since 1998. He was also said to have fabricated documents including a training course certificate. British Airways said: "The safety of our customers and crew is always our priority. The fully qualified pilot was suspended and an investigation launched as soon as BA CityFlyer became aware of discrepancies in his employment record. "At no point was there any risk to customers or colleagues." CAA general counsel, Jonathan Spence, said: "Pilot integrity is at the heart of aviation safety and we will take all steps necessary to maintain that position."
