A British Aerospace Hawk T45 was flying over Bedale on Tuesday at around 10:30am, when it transmitted the signal near Burneston, Bedale. When a crew resets their transponder to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700), it alerts all air traffic control facilities in the area. The code means that the aircraft has an emergency situation. It could mean any emergency or 'Mayday' situation such as engine failure, pressurization problems, other technical problems, or medical emergency. But usually, the alert is triggered due to engineering issues.  It has not yet been confirmed what the emergency is. The military aircraft was flying at around 500ft at the time it issued the alert. Last week, another RAF jet declared a 7700 emergency above Wales. The Hawk T2 model issued the alert when flying above the Caernarfon area while flying at an altitude of 22,300 feet and travelling at around 346mph. It is unclear what caused the emergency but according to Flightradar24 the jet was forced to land at 1.19pm after a total flight time of 24 minutes.

The Jet 2 flight issued the emergency signal at 6,000ft in the air. The RAF has recently said the use of a 7700 signal is not "uncommon". RAF Lossiemouth's official account posted to Twitter: "Setting a squawk of 7700 isn't uncommon in these situations and is simply a precaution. "The word 'emergency' can sometimes worry those who are unfamiliar with aviation, but these procedures ensure the safe recovery of any aircraft with problems in the air."
