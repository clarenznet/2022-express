One of the highlights of Andrea Bocelli’s career has to be his hit 1996 single Time To Say Goodbye, a duet he recorded with Sarah Brightman. The English version of the track Con te partirò topped the charts across Europe and is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with global sales amassing to over 12 million. Much to fans’ delight, the tenor has shared a climatic clip of the pair singing the famous track on his Instagram account. Bocelli has previously told Express.co.uk of his hopes of another team-up with Brightman and one of his other famous collaborators, Ed Sheeran. The tenor told us: “Why not! If there is an opportunity, I’d take it with great pleasure. The artists mentioned are two giants of music... The Time to Say Goodbye duet with Sarah made a critical contribution to the international launch of my career.” More recently, with Ed, we have established a very beautiful and creative collaboration. Those two voices provide two musical worlds very different from one another. But both duets triggered a special alchemy that allowed one to enhance the expressive qualities of the other.” DON'T MISSAndrea Bocelli celebrates Virginia’s 10th birthday: WATCH their duets [VIRGINIA]Andrea Bocelli shares climax of his Nessun dorma performance – WATCH [ANDREA]Matteo Bocelli makes stunning first solo Italian TV performance WATCH [MATTEO] Bocelli once told Ocean Drive that Time To Say Goodbye is one of his two favourite songs to sing, alongside side My Way.
