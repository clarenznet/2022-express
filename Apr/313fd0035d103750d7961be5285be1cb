Such a cruel approach will inevitably cause great suffering and trauma to those who are most in need of our help. The Government’s own data shows that two thirds of men, women and children arriving in small boats across the channel come from countries where war and persecution have forced them from their homes. No one risks their own – or their family’s – life, unless they are running from acute danger. Britain still has a reputation for justice, fair process, and a respect for human rights. This is why, under every Prime Minister since Churchill, we have always given a fair hearing to refugees fleeing war and persecution, and why we must continue to do so today. What’s more, offshoring the UK’s asylum system will do absolutely nothing to address the reasons why people take perilous journeys to find safety in the UK. And it will do little to deter them from coming to this country. It will only lead to more human suffering and chaos – and at huge expense of an estimated £1.4bn a year. Far from enabling people to rebuild their lives we know from where this has been tried by other countries, it only results in high levels of self-harm and mental health issues and, appallingly, can also lead to people ending up back in the hands of people smugglers. Instead, the Government should focus on running an orderly, humane and fair asylum system, developing safe routes to the UK – for example by introducing humanitarian visas – and upholding our reputation as a country which values compassion, fairness and human rights. • Enver Solomon is the chief executive of the Refugee Council.
