Rather than earning interest or a regular dividend income, people are enticed by the chance of winning prizes of £25 and £1 million in tax free cash. Purchased bonds are allocated a special number for every £1 invested and winning bonds are chosen by ERNIE, NS&I’s Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment. NS&I is also a Government-backed savings institution which offers peace of mind to savers, with their money 100 percent guaranteed by the Treasury. Meanwhile, it is estimated £74million is sitting in unclaimed prize winnings dating back to when Premium Bonds were first launched decades ago. People could be owed any amount of money from £25 up to £100,000. Anyone who has bought Premium Bonds since they were first launched in the 1950s is being urged to check old bond numbers. Although winners are usually notified when they’ve won, this isn’t always possible if someone moves.  What is happening where you live?
