Rebecca English, the Mail's royal editor believes it will be difficult for Harry to repair his relationship with the Royal Family because of the hatred he has for palace aides. She said: "Prince Harry has built up such a wall of resentment and hatred against these people, I suspect it will always be a stumbling block when it comes to repairing his relationships with family members. Because he has such a great distrust and dislike for the people around them." These comments follow an interview Prince Harry did with NBC's Today show in which he claimed to have a "really special relationship" with the Queen. The comments garnered some criticism, with some commentators claiming they could be seen as "triggering" to other Royals. Responding to Harry's comments, Royal expert Roya Nikkhah told The Royal Beat's host Kate Thornton: "That comment was quite triggering for the rest of his family, who are around the Queen all the time and who I'm sure the Queen does confide in quite a lot."
