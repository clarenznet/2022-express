Anne, 71, is patron of the Royal College of Midwives and Kate, 40, is patron of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists so it made sense to aides to get them together at the colleges’ headquarters in London to promote the vital work being done for women.  Perhaps inevitably, there was an anecdote involving horses from the Princess Royal. She left midwives in stitches as she recalled fearing that one of her babies had become “wedged” in her pelvis when she tripped over in a horse lorry while heavily pregnant. “I thought, that’s a bit interesting,” she said, adding that the baby “ended up the right way up though.” She did not say if it was her son Peter Phillips, 44, or her daughter Zara Tindall, 40. It came up when the Duchess, wearing a £400 Self-Portrait tailored crepe midi dress, and the Princess - nobody was brave enough to ask what she was wearing - were watching a demonstration of new training for health workers delivering by caesarean section an infant whose head is wedged in the pelvis. The NHS has faced a growing number of legal cases brought by parents whose babies have suffered head injuries as a result of getting wedged. Kate and Anne were also shown a new app from Tommy’s National Centre for Maternity Improvement which helps to determine which mothers-to-be are most at risk of complications by using algorithms to pick up on data from throughout their pregnancy. The women can access it on a smartphone. Anne criticised the way mothers are sometimes kept in the dark about their treatment by the medical profession. She said: “Pregnant women, they should know just as much as everybody else does but they’re seen, as I’ve said before, ‘You’re seen as a patient, you don’t need to be part of the answer’.”
