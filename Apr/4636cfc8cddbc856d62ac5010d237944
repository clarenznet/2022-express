The accident, on the M25 clockwise from J11 A320 St Peter's Way (Chertsey) to J12 M3 J2, has sparked 60-minute long queues, while Surrey's Roads Policing Unit (RPU) confirmed they are dealing with "a serious injury RTC". National Highways said there are 7.7 miles of congestion, which is stretching as far back as Wisley. As lanes one, two, and three of the M25 remain closed after the crash was reported at around 2pm this afternoon, it is still unclear how many vehicles were involved in the accident. While recovery work takes place, traffic site Inrix says: "Three lanes closed and queueing traffic due to accident on M25 clockwise from J11 A320 St Peters Way (Chertsey) to J12 M3 J2. Congestion to J10 (Wisley Interchange). "Lanes one, two and three (of four) are closed."

An update by the RPU around 4.15pm read: "We remain at the scene and will be for some time. Separately, a police incident at junction 23 for the M25 in South Mimms is causing chaos, too. As a result, clockwise traffic has been most heavily disrupted with queues tailing back towards junction 21 for the M1 near Bricket Wood, Google Maps data at 4.45pm showed. Bignells Corner — the roundabout where the M25 and A1 meet — appears completely gridlocked, which is causing delays in both directions on the A1 at junction 23 for the M25. The congestion on the M25 has led to roads in Potters Bar being busier than usual, while traffic is also heavier in the London Colney area.
