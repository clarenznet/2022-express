Jennifer Coleman and Janet Blankley were both 15 when they wrote descriptions of themselves on August 9, 1966, and invited boys to write back. But their romantic requests were all at sea until last Saturday when litter pickers found the corked bottle in mud by the Humber Estuary, Lincs. The notes from the Grantham girls could still be read. Janet's said: "I am 15, not bad looking." Jennifer wrote: "Please write if you are a boy under 18 over 16." Scunthorpe Litter Pickers Tracey Marshall and her daughter Charlotte reported the find on social media and tracked down Jennifer, who moved to Australia in 1973. Jennifer, now 71, said: "I'd completely forgotten about the message in the bottle. I can't believe it was in the water for that long.  "I remember when we wrote the letters. I think we just wanted boy pen pals. "I never married but met a man from Birmingham in my 50s. He passed away four years ago." It is believed Janet still lives in Grantham. Jennifer said: "I'd love to say hello and see where our paths went."
