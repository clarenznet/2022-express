Officers want residents in Bradley Stoke, Little Stoke, Patchway and Stoke Gifford, all near Bristol, to check their CCTV and doorbell footage after vehicles - including charity minibuses - were damaged. Police and the fire service are investigating the attacks, which happened at around 1am and 4.40am on Sunday. The charity minibuses provide transport for vulnerable adults and children, reports Bristol Live. Detective Inspector Will Thorpe, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: “We’re carrying out a thorough investigation into this series (of attacks) which has not only destroyed tens of thousands of pounds worth of vehicles but has left a charity unable to provide vital support to those in the local community. "Officers have carried out a number of house to house enquiries already and have also gathered CCTV from the area which appears to be of significance. "While we remain in the early stage of our inquiry, an initial review of the footage suggests two people were responsible for the attacks. "A number of people have already contacted us with information following yesterday’s public appeal and we’re really grateful for the support. "But we’re still keen to hear from local residents – particularly those in the Bradley Stoke and Stoke Gifford areas – who have CCTV, door camera or dash cam footage which captured two people together between 1am and 4.40am. "If residents with cameras could review their footage and contact us on 101 if they see anything suspicious, it could prove to be crucial to our investigation."  DI Thorpe added: "Our specialist crime scene investigators continue to work closely with our colleagues in the fire service to examine the vehicles which were targeted while neighbourhood officers remain in the area carrying out reassurance patrols. "Should anyone have any concerns about this series I’d encourage them to speak to an officer." There were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings.
