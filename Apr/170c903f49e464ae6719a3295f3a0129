Chrissy Teigen, 36, looked incredible at the GRAMMYs at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. The mother-of-two chose a statement gown for the occasion. The American model hit the red carpet wearing a Nicole + Felicia Couture ballgown. The fuschia ballgown also had huge ruffles. Chrissy was accompanied by her husband, John Legend, 43, to the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. John has previously won a dozen GRAMMY awards, including in 2021 when he won the best R&B album following the release of 'Bigger Love'. Chrissyâ€™s ballgown had a pleated skirt and even a strapless design. She wore her hair in a simple chignon, paired with large diamond earrings. The 36-year-old kept her makeup simple and natural-looking and let her outfit do all the talking. She posted a snap from the event to her Instagram account.
