Julie Jackson, 47, was drinking Prosecco with friends on her birthday when her pal Lindsey Clark got jammed with her legs in the air. The 40-year-old was trying to retrieve another friend's jacket which had fallen behind a seat at TwelveTwentyFive restaurant in Union Quay, North Shields, North Tyneside. Despite trying to help her friend out, Lindsey lost her footing and got wedged upside down. Two restaurant employees had to prise her out by her shins to set her free. Julie, from Newcastle, said: "We were out celebrating my birthday. "We were drinking all sorts but a lot of Prosecco."  "My other friend's jacket fell behind the sofa so Lindsey reached down to get it and fell behind the sofa. "She was stuck for about ten minutes in total."
