With just a week to go before the location elections, in which Northern Ireland will elect new Assembly members, ex-Brexit minister Lord David Frost warned talks over the NI protocol needed to make further progress if a crisis is to be avoided. He warned Northern Ireland Protocol has left the Good Friday Agreement "on life support", saying: "The strains it is causing are actively damaging the Belfast Agreement. It is therefore surely obvious, indeed it is an inescapable logical conclusion, that the protocol can't be operated as it stands. It has to be renegotiated or removed." But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss seems to have reached a stalemate with her EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic on how Protocol talks should progress. Lord Frost said: “She's made, I think, no more progress really than we made last year in the negotiations. I'm in no way surprised by that." He added that he thinks "she's doing an excellent job", but indicated triggering Article 16 may be the only option - denying it would break international law. Lord Frost said: "It's time to put our own interests first, the integrity of UK first, the British people first and I hope the Government will decide to do so."
