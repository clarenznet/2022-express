The 51-year-old Britain's Got Talent judge looked glammed up as she stood atop a beach chair and posed for the camera. Amanda Holden let down her shoulder-length blonde hair and donned a pair of sunglasses for the occasion. The beauty showed off her toned figure in a swimsuit by popular designer Melissa Odabash, who has been praised by celebrities such as supermodel Kate Moss and reality star Kim Kardashian. Amanda has been living it up in California over the Easter weekend, meaning warm and balmy temperatures were virtually guaranteed. On Sunday, the sultry star looked like she had barely left her teenage years behind as she posed on Santa Monica Pier in a pair of tiny denim shorts and a skimpy zebra print bikini top. For an added sporty style, she accessorised the look with an Adidas baseball cap and trainers. If the weather turns unseasonably cold later in the spring, with snowy conditions forecast for the coming weeks, at least fans can catch up with Amanda and her dazzling outfits on the latest episode of Britain's Got Talent, when the action is sure to heat things up.
