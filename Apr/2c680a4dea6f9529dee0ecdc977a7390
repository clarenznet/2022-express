Winnie Harlow, 27, took to Instagram to share a new series of bikini pictures with her 9.7 million followers yesterday. The model sparked a frenzy as she slipped into a tiny bikini that flashed her toned abs. Winnie could be seen in the photos posing by the sea as she enjoyed a drink sitting under a parasol. In some of the pictures, Winnie can be seen holding up her drink as she looks fiercely into the camera and strikes a relaxed pose in her portable beach chair. Other shots see the model face away from the camera, flashing her bum in view of other beachgoers enjoying the sunset. One snap sees Winnie pose next to a bar and looking into the distance through her sunglasses. She could also be seen looking into the camera from her side as she prepared to sip her tropical, watermelon-garnished drink. The model was diagnosed with the chronic skin condition vitiligo, characterised by depigmentation of portions of the skin, at the age of four. Fans of the social media star rushed to the post’s comments section to heap praise on the Jamaican-Canadian beauty. Watchjazzy wrote: “WINNIE!!!! YOU ARE STUNNING!!!” Terrencevassell simply stated: “Real beauty.” Amber_deprez added: “Such a beautyyy.”
