With hard work, humour and the perseverance required to convince British publishing house Methuen it was the right decision, they succeeded in their task. Lonsdale-Cooper later recalled how word-for-word translations were hard. "Some of the text was in Brussels patois and had to be turned into appropriate English - there were masses of problems that we encountered," she said. The pair anglicised names and French expressions. Tintin's dog Milou became Snowy and Professeur Tryphon Tournesol became Professor Calculus. They concocted the now-famous English catchphrase "Billions of blue blistering barnacles!" for Captain Haddock. In total, they worked on 24 books and their translations became the blueprint for international publishers. Lonsdale-Cooper was the Open University's first publishing director in 1970 and, as a young woman, spent two years as Lord Rothschild's secretary. Leslie Londsale-Cooper was born in Northwood, Middlesex, and was named after her father, a former Royal Navy Lieutenant commander who served at the Battle of Jutland. He died shortly before she was born and she was raised by her mother Nora. She attended the Royal Naval School in Twickenham and went on to secretarial college, which saw her join the US Embassy in London. Because of her skills - she spoke six languages fluently - she attended the Nuremberg Trials.
