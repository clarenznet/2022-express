Liz Hurley, 56, has taken to Instagram to share a picture of her enviable figure to her followers. In view of her 2.3 million followers she posed on a sofa in a barely-there blue bikini. The model left her ample assets on full display, along with her toned midriff. Her signature brunette tresses were left cascading down and she opted for a smokey eyed makeup look. She captioned the post: "Filming on a sunny island has its pros #newmovie #fatherchristmasisback…again." Many social media users took to the posts comments to compliment the model. Qazi1902 said: "Gorgeous, beautiful, stunning xx." Markashone added: "Sensational, looking well indeed." Liz's post comes after she received backlash from fans and associations alike for posing with two starfishes. According to World Animal Protection you should never touch or remove a starfish from the water, as this could lead to them suffocating or being harmed by your skin or suncream. However, Liz explained on Instagram how she had saved them after finding them on the beach, posing for a photo but then putting them back safely. Liz penned: "Found these magnificent starfish, alive but stranded, on the beach — they're now happily back at the bottom of the sea." Social media user 77percent_scott commented: "At least you tried, but those starfish are gonna die due to exposure." A Marine biologist Professor Morgan Prachett spoke to AU news about the picture. He said: "It is not uncommon for them to be washed up on a beach. "It's unlikely that they would die from being out of the water for a few minutes, but it does depend how long the starfish were out of the water /stranded on the beach."
