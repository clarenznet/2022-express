The state pension is set to rise on April 11, 2022, helping pensioners to keep up with the rising cost of living. However, some British retirees will not see the increase this month. This is because expats living in certain countries receive a ‘frozen’ state pension. The UK state pension is only increased in certain nations which have an agreement with the UK.

This can be very damaging to their spending power, as inflation takes its toll over time and reduces the value of their state pension.
