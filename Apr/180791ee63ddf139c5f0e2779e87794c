Builder Adrian Cusiac, from Harrow, north-west London, got £50,000 from Barclays after he claimed Rocasca UK Ltd turned over a minimum of £200,000 in 2019. However, his director disqualification statement read: "Prior to receipt of the loan the account balance stood at £2.72 in credit." Romanian Mr Cusiac, who blew the cash on poker, said he was "not proud of me". Steven Davison was handed £35,000 for Broadway Sandwich Bar in Blyth, Northumberland. The 32-year-old frittered it on gambling, renovating his garden and launching another doomed business. Pub Landlord Ciaran Twomey collected £50,000 despite his pub company no longer functioning.
