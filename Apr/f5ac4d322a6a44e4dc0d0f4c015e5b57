Viewers of Channel 4’s Undercover Boss USA saw the president of the travel retailer reward Elizabeth, a barista, for being so great at her job and making the brand successful. Undercover Boss USA shows the journey of bosses who go in disguise among their own staff to see where their firm is excelling and where it needs improvement. Elizabeth lives at home with her children and grandchildren. She explained to Mr DiDomizio that she loves having them stay with her but sometimes she wishes she could have her own place. She said: “I love having them live with me, but I pay for everything.” This puts a lot of pressure on her financially.

I don’t think I have it bad, I really don’t.” Elizabeth has many personal and financial responsibilities, and the undercover boss thought it was unfair that she had to choose between fixing a medical issue for herself and taking care of her family. He was determined to help her and make her life easier. After revealing his identity, he said to her: “You’re a very special person and I want to help. “I want you to get the surgery and I want you to get better.” Mr DiDomizio wanted to pay for Elizabeth’s treatment as a way to say thank you to her for being so positive in the company. He said he wanted to ease her life. He said: “I’m going to pay for everything and I’m going to make sure you’re paid full while the time you take to recover. “You take care of so many people. I want to make it easier for you. “For the next year I am going to pay for rent in full.” He added: “I want to give you $20,000 [around £15,000] so that you have retirement and you have trips.” With tears in her eyes Elizabeth said: “I have never seen that much money. “You are one beautiful man.” Undercover Boss USA is available to watch on All4.
