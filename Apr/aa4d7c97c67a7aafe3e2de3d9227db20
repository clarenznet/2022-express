Globe-trotting Instagram model Demi Rose is on the move yet again, after celebrating her 27th birthday in the French Alps, and living it up in Spain and St Lucia in the weeks prior to that. Few people can say they have had such a dramatic comeback following the pandemic era as Demi Rose, after her myriad of trips abroad as soon as travel restrictions relaxed. The star treated her almost 20 million followers to snaps of her wearing a crimson coloured floor length dress with a thigh-high slit, plus a tight corset around her midriff to accentuate her tiny waist. She teamed the outfit with a matching bright red Chanel handbag, plus desert-appropriate cowboy boots for Coachella, which is held in the Colorado Desert, California. Meanwhile, her hair was worn in a long blonde ponytail which cascaded all the way down her thighs. The day before, she'd showcased her curvaceous figure in a long white crocheted skirt with sheer panels. Her latest snap has already had almost 150,000 likes - and she is sure to maintain the attention of followers as she continues her journey around the globe.
