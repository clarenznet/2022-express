The Thief, his Wife and The Canoe is based on the extraordinary crimes of the man who came back from the dead. Darwin faked his own demise at sea in 2002 in an accident so his wife Anne could claim more than £500,000 in life insurance. The four-parter is based on the book by former Express assistant editor David Leigh, portrayed by actor David Flynn in Panama in the opening scenes. Anne, 69, was left there when Darwin, 71, returned to London to hand himself in after five years ­living as a “dead man”. The show recreates his time in hiding, first in a room behind a wardrobe in their Co Durham home, then in Panama with Anne. A visa issue prompted his return home before the photo which exposed their scam. It shows them posing with an estate agent in the Central American country in 2006. Darwin initially told police he was suffering from amnesia. And Anne told David, a consultant on the series, she thought he was dead. She kept up the lie to sons Mark, 37, and Anthony, 34. And in the drama, Anne describes the photo as “easily the most stupid thing we did”. David recalls: “That picture from Panama was the evidence that brought an end to the Darwins’ lies. “It was the emphatic proof Anne had been lying about her husband’s faked death to everyone she held dear for nearly six years. “It was a massive journalistic scoop and incredible to be an integral part of a jaw-dropping story. “But it was also quite emotional watching someone’s life crumble before my eyes. When I showed her the image, she held her head in her hands and sobbed. She kept repeating, ‘What have I done? The boys are never going to forgive me’.” Eddie Marsan and Monica Dolan portray the Darwins in the drama. ● The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe starts on Easter Sunday
