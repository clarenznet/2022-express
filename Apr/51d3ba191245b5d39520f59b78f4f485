The guest, who celebrated her 50th birthday at the Edinburgh venue with family recently, claimed she was sat at a table too high for her elderly parents. The woman left a savage one-star review on the popular travel website. Writing online, the guest said: "I had booked tonight for my 50th birthday meal. Once arriving we were shown to a high table which was not suitable as I was there with elderly parents. We were then given a table in the bar, and told to order our meal at the bar. "The music was very loud but we decided to stay and I joined the queue to order. Fifteen minutes later I was still in the queue. With people pushing past me extremely drunk, kissing and shouting."The bar staff were more interested in serving these students their cheap cocktails. No one was monitoring the situation and I am positive that under covid rules you were meant to wear masks at a bar, which not one person did. "When I did get served I was accused of not paying my last food bill. I explained we had not eaten but this was repeatedly questioned."We ended up walking out which has totally ruined my birthday. Stay well clear unless you want an unprofessional visit. "Definitely more interested in students' money than protecting others from covid." But Slug and Lettuce has apologised for the experience, Edinburgh Live reports.   Responding to the critique, Slug and Lettuce said: "We pride ourselves on providing exceptional service, so we are disappointed to hear that your visit with us was anything less than satisfactory. "When placing your booking we do advise that you let us know of any prerequisites so that we can make your visit as enjoyable as possible. We apologise for the mix up with the bills and will look further into this with the team on service. "We hope that we can use the points you have raised to improve. We hope you have a great day."
