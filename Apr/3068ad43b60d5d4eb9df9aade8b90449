Protests against the protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland within the single market for goods and requires EU checks on British goods entering the country -are on the increase. Last week, the window of the office of Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was smashed following his announcement that he would no longer attend protests against the protocol. He said: “Somebody can smash my window but I can fix it, but the first time that someone gets injured, the first time that someone gets killed, there is no going back on that. “We are in a spiral of violence that I do not want to get us into. This is nothing to do with the election, this purely to do with protests around the protocol, which I do not think we should get involved in to raise ­tensions.” Dale Pankhurst, teaching ­assistant and PhD candidate at Queen’s ­University Belfast added that there is a "battle against time" to stop the situation from escalating. He added: "Many Unionists view the ­protocol as an assault on the fabric of the ­Union and a violation of the ­principle of ­consent within the Belfast ­Agreement." Talks on the issues within the protocol are ongoing.  FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
