Part of the M62 was closed in both directions yesterday near Goole, East Yorkshire due to the smash, which happened at around 10am on the eastbound side. Police have now confirmed the 53-year-old driver of the HGV and the 54-year-old driver of the car involved - which caught fire after impact - have both died of their injuries.
