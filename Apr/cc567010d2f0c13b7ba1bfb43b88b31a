But the Home Secretary insisted there would be an increase in numbers. She said: "I apologise with frustration myself it takes time to start up a new route. "We are an independent third country and we want to give people the status and security of coming to our country along with the warm welcome." She added: "We are welcoming people - over 40,000 visas being granted, over 10,000 people over a space of five weeks coming to the United Kingdom." Latest figures showed 12,000 Ukrainians have so far made it to Britain, around 10,800 through the family visa system. Only 1,200 people have arrived under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.
