OnePlus announced its latest flagship smartphone, OnePlus 10 Pro 5G, at an event last month. The new handset will hit store shelves across the UK starting April 5, but ahead of that time – fans have the chance to unlock a stellar pre-order deal. If you place an order before the UK release date of April 5, OnePlus will bundle a pair of its noise-cancelling wireless earbuds, the OnePlus Buds Pro, for free. If you wanted to buy OnePlus Buds Pro separately from the OnePlus store, you'll need to pay £139. That's a very generous free gift. OnePlus has made it incredibly simple to claim this free gift – you won't have to fill out a form after you've made your purchase or anything like that. As you're adding OnePlus 10 Pro 5G to your basket, you'll find an option to pick between the Glossy White and Matte Black variants of the OnePlus Buds Pro. And that's it. OnePlus will mail out your new handset as soon as it's released. Depending on the delivery option that you selected during checkout, it could take a day or two for your new flagship phone to arrive. And that's it. For those who missed the launch event, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G boasts a number of improvements over its predecessor. It arrives with the latest processor from US chipmaker Qualcomm, dubbed Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which unlocks faster performance – perfect for those who play games or want to run multiple apps side-by-side. The boosted speed isn't just limited to that shiny new chipset, either. The Shenzhen-based company has equipped its latest flagship phone with the fastest charging speeds ever shipped on any OnePlus handsets, which can replenish the hefty 5,000 mAh battery from 1-100% in just 32 minutes. Dubbed 80W SUPERVOOC charging, the wired plug can also top-up the smartphone with enough power to last an entire day in 15 minutes. On the front of the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is a 6.7-inch Quad HD touchscreen that can tweak its refresh rate between 1 Hz and 120 Hz. At 120Hz, system animations – like scrolling through a menu, or launching an app – appears much smoother and more responsive. This is something you'll find on a number of flagship phones, including the latest from Samsung, Apple and Google. However, this can be a drain on battery life. By ramping down the refresh-rate to just 1 Hz when there's relatively little happening on-screen, such as when listening to music or looking at a static photograph, OnePlus can dramatically extend the battery life. Unlocking the handset is handled by a fingerprint scanner embedded beneath the touchscreen. On the back of the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is the new triple-camera system, which was co-engineered by the prestigious camera brand Hasselblad. The main 48-megapixel camera and the 8-megapixel telephoto camera as identical to those found on the OnePlus 9 Pro last year. Both of these are capable of shooting in full 10-bit colour. As such, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G processes 64 times more colour than smartphones that shoot in 8-bit colour – the standard for most handsets. New for the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G is the 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera, which offers an expansive 150° field of view. That's around four times wider than those captured by the 120° ultra-wide cameras found on a number of other popular smartphones. OnePlus 10 Pro 5G arrives preinstalled with OxygenOS 12.1, which is based on Android 12. An upcoming upgrade, based on Android 13, will be released before the end of the year. OnePlus guarantees at least three major Android updates and four years of security updates.
