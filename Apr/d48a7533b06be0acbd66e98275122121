EA Sports is about to close voting for the FIFA 22 Community Team of the Season. With the domestic football season coming to an end, EA Sports is getting ready to unveil the best players in each of Europe's top leagues. It all starts with the Community Team of the Season, which features standout players from various leagues and divisions. This includes Premier League stars such as Wilfried Zaha and Hugo Lloris, as well as lower league performers including Blackburn's Ben Brereton Díaz and Morecambe's Cole Stockton. Other recognised players include ex-Premier League star Luis Suárez, as well as Gerard Moreno and Alexandre Lacazette. Community Team voting began earlier this month, and ends at 6pm BST on April 20. This means you only have a short time to cast your vote. The Community Team will be announced in full at April 29, followed by the Premier League FIFA 22 TOTS on May 6. The news was announced by EA Sports on Twitter: "Time to decide. This season's best squad is in your hands. Vote for your Community #TOTS now."
