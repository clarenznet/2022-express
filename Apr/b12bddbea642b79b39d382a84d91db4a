A total of 23 failures on Spirit of Britain were discovered by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors. The safety issues were listed without further details by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which is an alliance of 27 national maritime authorities including the UK. It stated there was a “lack of familiarity” with the “operation of life-saving appliances”, which could relate to equipment such as rescue boats, lifeboats, life-jackets or flares. Fast rescue boats were not properly maintained and oil filtering equipment was not working. There were also five deficiencies with working conditions, and five relating to fire safety systems. Spirit of Britain was detained following an inspection on April 11, before being cleared to sail on April 22. The vessel was used by P&O Ferries to restart operations between Dover and Calais on Tuesday for the first time since the company sacked hundreds of staff and replaced them with agency workers on March 17 to save money. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch described the report as “further evidence that P&O is a capitalist bandit sailing in our waters”. Spirit of Britain was built in 2011 and can carry up to 2,000 passengers. At 213 metres long it is one of the largest ferries in Europe. P&O Ferries has previously said the inspections are being conducted with “an unprecedented level of rigour”. In response, the MCA said its inspectors work “in exactly the same robust way” for every ship.
