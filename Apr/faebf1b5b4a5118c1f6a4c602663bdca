Fortnum & Mason and the Big Jubilee Lunch launched the competition to celebrate the monarch’s 70 years on the throne. A BBC One special on May 12 will chart the royal grocer’s quest to find “an original and celebratory cake, tart or pudding fit for the Queen”. Fortnums want something “makeable in a home kitchen, telling a story, and having the potential to stand the test of time”. It follows Coronation Chicken for the Queen’s coronation and the Victoria sponge named after  Queen Victoria. Nearly 5,000 entries were whittled down to five. The finalists will bake their recipes on TV and present them to the judges. As well as Dame Mary, 87, the judging panel will include MasterChef: The Professionals judge Monica Galetti, food writer Jane Dunn, chef Matt Adlard and culinary historian Regula Ysewijn. Camilla, who is a patron of the Big Jubilee Lunch, will be a special guest to announce the winner. The chosen recipe will feature on the BBC’s Good Food website. The Jubilee Pudding: 70 Years In The Baking, BBC One at 8pm on May 12.
