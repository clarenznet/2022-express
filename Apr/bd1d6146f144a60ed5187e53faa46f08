Speaking at an awards ceremony at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East, Putin said:"Our forces are working cleverly and effectively and using the most modern weapons." He added that there is no doubt that Russia will complete its "noble" objectives and that Russian forces had no choice but to invade Ukraine. Putin's weapons have previously been slammed for being outdated and for bogging down Russian troops. Putin's statement comes as thousands of Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv and Chernihiv in recent days, crossing the border into Belarus. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
