Power Book IV: Force is the latest spin-off series to come from the Power franchise of the thrilling crime universe. 50 Cent, who is the show's executive producer, unleashed a furious rant at the streaming network Starz after the show’s ninth episode was leaked before its official scheduled release date.  On Monday the rapper turned actor took to Instagram to express his anger after a major episode landed on the streaming platform before its intended release date. The spin-off series, which follows Tommy Egan (played by Joseph Sikora) as he relocated to Chicago and became a drug distributor after faking his death in New York, was nearing its finale. As well as blasting the network, 50 Cent shared three different tweets from fans who also took to social media to expose the leak. One viewer had also written a summary of the entire episode in less than 140 words, spoiling the instalment for unsuspecting fans.

He wrote: “see they leaked the episode again these people are incompetent. I went to Harvard, so the f**k what! SMH.” Annoyingly for the showrunner, this isn’t the first time he has had to deal with a similar situation with Starz. However, after signing a $150 million four-year contract with the network back in 2018, these issues could soon be a thing of the past. In March 50 Cent threatened to cut ties with Starz and pull all the Power shows from the network. Alongside a clip of a man packing his suitcase, the showrunner captioned the post: “This is me packing my stuff, STARZ. Sucks, my deal is up over here I’m out. “They renewed High Town, and FORCE is the highest-rated show they have sitting in limbo. “If I told you how much dumb shit I deal with over here, you would think they all went to school on a small yellow bus.” DON'T MISS...Carolina Married At First Sight Australia: Where is Carolina Santos? [INSIGHT]Power Force’s Gloria star opens up on shocking death [INSIGHT]Power Book 4: Walter and Serbian war teased in promo [THEORY] In a separate post, 50 Cent wrote: “Hold my calls I’m travelling. Getting the f**k away from STARZ. "Anil get your f****g bag’s in the car now, we are out of here, take that f*g sign off the door no more G-unit film and television over here.” He continued: “Josh hurry the f**k up, get all the scripts we out! Micheal what the f**k are you takings so long for, let’s go! “Why are you holding all of your clothing so perfect, we can just get new clothes when we get where we going.” The 46-year-old was recently angered by the network for taking a while to confirm the second season of Power Book IV: Force, even though the upcoming instalment for the other spin-off shows were confirmed before the first season had even been released. He wrote about that situation: “FORCE is the highest rated premier of any show on the network. when they take too long to greenlight it, it pushes the production timeline back.” 50 Cent concluded: “After tonight’s episode there are 3 left, April 10 it’s a wrap. Then 6 months till I have anything new.” Power Book IV: Force is available on Starz in the US and available on Starzplay in the UK.
