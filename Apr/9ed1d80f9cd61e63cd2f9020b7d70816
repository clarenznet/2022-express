Ollie Tutt, 19, says he lost his job for swearing in the recording. He can be heard saying in the clip: "If you want an easy job, just go and work at Tesco, Sainsbury and do this delivering s***. "It is possibly the easiest job I've ever had - the best paying job I've ever had and I actually get looked after. "I don’t do much - I just sit on the side of the road waiting to do these drops. All the customers are f*****g lovely and haven’t had an occasion where they have been an a******e." He added: "Don’t work in the store though, that’s s**t and boring. Seriously, if you wanna do an easy job, just do this." A Sainsbury’s spokesperson told BirminghamLive: "We are unable to discuss individual colleague cases.  "Any decision to review a colleague’s employment is not taken lightly and based on a range of factors." Out of work Ollie said: "That video got a lot more attention than I thought it would and caused a bit of a problem. "My manager told me that the store manager didn’t really mind, but because I swore in that video it’s kind of bad for the company. Which kind of is obvious because it doesn’t look really good on them." He added: "It's not a big deal - like they are a multi-billion-pound company and they care about a single video.

It comes as shopper footfall across the UK continued its gradual improvement in March as consumers enjoyed their first full month free of Covid restrictions. While all UK shopping locations enjoyed higher footfall levels than earlier in the pandemic, shopping centres saw significant improvement for the first time in 2022 as people browsed multiple stores in preparation for the summer, British Retail Consortium (BRC)-Sensormatic IQ figures show.

Leaked audio of Putin's 'war crimes' [REPORT] Total UK footfall was still down 15.4 percent in March on three years previously, but a 1.2 percentage point improvement from February and better than the three-month average decline of 15.9 percent. Footfall on high streets was down 17.8 percent on March three years ago but 3.1 percentage points better than last month's rate. BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: "March saw another gradual improvement to footfall levels across the UK. As the first full month without coronavirus restrictions in England and Northern Ireland, consumers were able to shop with a greater sense of normality, spurred on by some spring sunshine. "There are many challenges on the horizon as consumer confidence fell to its lowest levels in 16 months. Consumers are now feeling the effects of rising living costs, increased food and fuel prices, and are also anticipating higher energy prices from 1 April.  "The impact on retail footfall and retail sales across both stores and online is yet to be seen, but as belts continue to tighten and prices continue to rise, it will be a difficult road ahead for consumers." More than two-fifths (42 percent) of people expect their finances to worsen over the next three months, according to a wealth and wellbeing tracker. LV= described its findings as the most downbeat since June 2020 when its quarterly survey began. A similar proportion (44 percent) of the 4,000 people surveyed across the UK in March admitted their finances had already deteriorated over the previous three months.  More than half (58 percent) of people said their total monthly outgoings have increased in the past few months and 23 percent are now saving less. Pensioners were found to be particularly likely to say their spending has increased. Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of retirees said their supermarket spend has increased in the past three months and 46 percent expect their finances to worsen over next three months. The state pension and some other benefits are uprated by 3.1 percent in April, but inflation could hit a 40-year high of 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).  Clive Bolton, managing director of protection, savings and retirement at LV= said: "The results of the latest LV= wealth and wellbeing monitor highlight how the finances of millions of people are being squeezed by the large rise in the cost of living. "The indices for savings, financial outlook and outgoings are the worst recorded since we started surveying consumers two years ago. "Consumer sentiment had been steadily improving between spring and early autumn 2021 as the success of the vaccine programme, fall in death rates and easing of lockdown restrictions allowed life to begin to return to normal. "However, the sharp rise in the cost of living has caused confidence to fall dramatically." He added that rising energy prices are becoming a significant problem for many people, particularly those who are retired.
