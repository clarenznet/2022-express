The Duke of York shared his memories of the Falklands War on his ex-wife’s account to mark the 40-year anniversary of the war. Beneath the last post, it said it was ‘written by HRH The Duke of York’ before the ‘HRH’ was deleted. It is understood that Andrew's reflections on the Falklands were not seen by the Queen or Buckingham Palace in advance. A palace source told the Sunday Times: "The Duke is delusional if he thinks he has any chance of resuming a public role." Less than three hours later, three Instagram posts, which also included his musings on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, were deleted. FOLLOW BELOW FOR ROYAL UPDATES:
