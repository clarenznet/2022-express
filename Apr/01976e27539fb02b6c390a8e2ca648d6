Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse took to Instagram to criticise pals for liking a post showing Russian women destroying their Chanel handbags after the brand blacklisted their country, but staying silent on the subject of the war in Ukraine. The dance star, 40, expressed her disgust at the actions in her Instagram stories. Motsi's post comes as Chanel has issued a ban on Russian citizens buying their products as a result of the country's invasion of Ukraine - and some fashionistas are furious, taking to the internet to prove it. The post Motsi was referring to was one by the Monte Carlo-based fashion and beauty influencer @victoriabonya, who has over 9.3 million followers. In the video, the influencer wrote how Chanel "doesn't respect its clients". Victoria proceeded to rip one of their classic quilted leather handbags to shreds, tearing it to pieces with a large pair of scissors and throwing it across the room. READ NOW:Â 'Shut the f**k up!'
