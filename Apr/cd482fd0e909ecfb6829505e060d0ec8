The French President is facing his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen being just two points behind him in the latest polls. Ms Le Pen was runner-up to Emmanuel Macron in 2017, and she is again his closest rival as French voters head to the ballots today for the first round. An expert has highlighted that, so far, polls including those before the Brexit referendum and the US Presidential Elections of 2016 and 2020, have “underestimated the populist right”. Political analyst Jeff Greenfield has said that this could happen in the current French elections too. In a post on Twitter, he said: “One note about the French election: polls in the US (Trump in ‘16 and ‘20) Britain (Brexit) and elsewhere have underestimated the populist Right…” He added: “Be curious to see if that happens tomorrow (right now Macron has a small lead that has been shrinking).” Voting in the big cities of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille is taking place today from 08:00 to 20:00 local time (06:00-18:00 GMT). Presidential elections in France occur every five years and typically involve two rounds of voting. The second round of voting will be staged in two weeks, on Sunday, April 24. Polls so far predict reelection for Mr Macron, who has been in the Presidency since 2017.

A poll conducted just 10 days ago predicted that 32 percent of voters could abstain from the elections. The main reason given was that people see "nothing new" in the proposals of candidates, and they believe that “the die is already cast”.
