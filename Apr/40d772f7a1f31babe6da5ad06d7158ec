The thought of boarding a plane and flying abroad – the first time in three years – had left me giddy and making my way to the airport, I could hardly contain my excitement. I arrived early and bounded cheerily to the check-in desk where queues, confusion and delays greeted me. Despite there being far fewer passengers than before Covid, BA had managed to create long queues which moved painfully slowly – so slowly that just as you thought you were getting close to the front of the queue, passengers on slightly earlier flights were ushered in front so they could board, while the rest of us were pushed even further back down the line. After eventually checking in, Heathrow added to the flight distress with further excessive and painfully slow queues at security. While the pain was apparent for everyone going through check-in and security checks, there was clearly a bigger pain being suffered by shop owners at the terminals waiting to sell to passengers. The length of time it took to check-in and get through security meant that there was barely any time to browse the shops. If I were one of those shop owners, paying huge rents, I would be demanding a refund from Heathrow bosses until they manage to get people to the departure side more efficiently. To add salt to the wound, BA suffered another of their technical issues, meaning the night before I was set to fly home a text message arrived from them to say they had cancelled my flight – but not to worry as they would put me on a later plane in economy class (instead of the premium economy I had booked) at no extra cost! How good of them. In my experience, BA is an embarrassment as our supposedly national flagship airline. My advice is to avoid flying with BA at all costs, and from Heathrow if at all possible. Their customer service levels mean they don’t deserve any customers at all.
