Scottie Scheffler will be the man to beat on Saturday after his impressive round of 67 pushed him five shots clear of the rest of the field. The new world No 1 came into Augusta National this week as a strong favourite having shown the best form of anybody in 2022. And history is on Scheffler's side to win his first major with no player blowing a five-shot lead at The Masters since 1945. The American still has two days to get through before thinking of that infamous Green Jacket, but he's confident of staying the course. "I feel my game is in a good spot," Scheffler said . "I've done a good job of managing my way around the golf course. I've kept the cards pretty clean which is nice." Scheffler was one of just a few players to cope with the tricky conditions at Augusta on Friday. Only Justin Thomas (one-under par) was able to match Scheffler's round of 67 as most who topped the leaderboard on Thursday fell down the order. JUST IN:Â Ex-Masters champ Garcia left red-faced with embarrassing triple bogey  Cameron Smith, Dustin Johnson, Danny Willett and Patrick Cantlay were among those to shoot over par on Friday. Tiger Woods began his second round in terrible fashion with four bogeys through the opening five holes. It looked at one stage as though he would be close to the cut, but a valuable birdie on the eighth set him back up the leaderboard. Three birdies on the back nine saw Woods eventually sit inside the top 10, nine shots off the lead. DON'T MISS  But a few of the world's best players failed to make the cut with Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka and Xander Schauffele seeing their Masters journey come to an end. Moving Day at The Masters will see plenty of action up and down the leaderboard on Saturday though with the first pairing teeing off at 3.20pm BST. Woods tees off at 6pm alongside Kevin Kisner while Scheffler will be joined by Charl Schwartzel in the final group at 7.50pm.
