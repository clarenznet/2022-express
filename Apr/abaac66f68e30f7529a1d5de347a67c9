Uber Pet enables the user to board on a pet-friendly ride, along with their animal friends. In order to request a ‘Pet Friendly’ ride on the application, users have to choose "Tap to customize" under UberX, and then swipe to add “Pet Friendly Ride”. Only one pet is allowed on board with them on each ride. On its website, Uber clarifies: “Any additional pets you bring are within the individual driver partner's discretion.” The animals allowed on Pet Friendly Rides should be “small dogs or cats”. However, the company also noted that there is also no breed or size restrictions. Rides along with animal companions come with an additional cost and therefore are slightly more expensive than regular rides. According to the company, riders might also be charged a fee by the driver, for cleaning or repairs, if needed. This could occur in the event that their pet leaves waste, excessive hair, or causes damage. Uber shared some advice to help its users avoid being charged with extra cost. The company suggests users have their pet restrained with a leash, harness or placed in a crate/carrier. Moreover, it asks users help drivers keep their vehicles clean for all riders. This could be achieved if the owner brings with them protective fabric, like a blanket or a towel to cover the car seat. The company requests owners to be respectful to their drivers, and ask them whether they have a preference for where their pet should sit. Uber advises users to not leave pets unattended during the ride. The new service, however, does not refer to service animals assisting disabled passengers - as these are always welcome. These, according to Uber’s policies, are nevertheless permitted to accompany riders at all times, without any additional charge.
