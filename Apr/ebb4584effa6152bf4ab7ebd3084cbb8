The Met PCSO was arrested yesterday, the day after the disturbing video emerged on Twitter, and was quickly viewed by thousands of people. The video appears to show the PCSO pleasuring himself on a park bench, while watching something on his phone. A spokesperson for the Met Police confirmed that a PCSO was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of outraging public decency. The force said it first became aware of the video just before 11.30pm on Wednesday night.  In a follow-up post, the Twitter user appeared to confront the officer with his badge number visible. It is not clear when or where in London the incident took place. Commander Kyle Gordon, of the Met’s Roads and Transport Policing Command, said: “I know that everyone will be absolutely shocked by this video. I am absolutely horrified and saddened by incidents such as this, as are all decent officers and staff. They are contrary to everything we stand for. "I would like to reassure everyone that we are working as fast as we possibly can to identify the full circumstances of what took place.  "As soon as we became aware of the video just before midnight we acted immediately. “Officers worked throughout the night and a serving member of police staff was arrested in the early hours of this morning and taken into custody.” The force added that a referral had been made to its Directorate of Professional Standards as well as the police watchdog, the IOPC.
