Chelsie, who had been told she would not live past the age of 16, was rushed to Southampton General Hospital on Saturday, her heartbroken husband Glyn, 33, confirmed yesterday. He posted online: "I'm afraid this is the hardest thing I have ever had to write. This morning Chelsie took a rapid turn for the worse and became unresponsive "It is with deepest regret I have to inform everyone our dearest beautiful Chelsie sadly passed away this afternoon at 2.45pm. It was very quick and she was not in any pain." He then paid tribute to his "gorgeous" wife, who he called an "inspiration". Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. Chelsie's immune system was weakened and her scarred, inoperable lungs only functioned at 25 percent of normal capacity. Chelsie, who lived in Denmead, Hampshire, had starred in CBBC shows Dani's House and Sadie J before her career was cut short at the age of 20. When the pandemic hit, she was ordered to have intravenous treatment at home after her specialist hospital was given over to Covid patients. She said at the time: "I know seeing my friends and family is too dangerous and it could be enough to tip my body over the edge. But on the other hand, I don't know how much time I have."
