Max Verstappen had the biggest smile after Friday's qualifying session as he stole pole in what was a messy hour of action at Imola. Five red flags were waved in total with the likes of Carlos Sainz and Valtteri Bottas crashing under tricky conditions. Ferrari had been the dominant team in free practice earlier in the day with Charles Leclerc and Sainz impressing on intermediate tyres.  Tricky conditions followed in qualifying and it was Mercedes who were struggling for pace in Q1. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell both just about survived being knocked out in Q1, but they were unable to qualify for Q3 with the pair finishing 13th and 11th respectively. Track conditions worsened throughout the session as drivers had to navigate their way round the track with the weather changing every minute. Sainz was punished for a small error in Q2 as he sent his Ferrari spinning into the wall, although his time set earlier in Q2 guaranteed he would start Saturday's sprint in 10th. Leclerc was still the favourite for pole in Q3, but Verstappen capitalised at the right time to put in his fastest lap just before Bottas crashed out, meaning Leclerc had to back off his lap to challenge the Dutchman. There was just a few minutes left in the session, but rain continued to come down and making the track more slippery meaning nobody was able to improve on their times.
