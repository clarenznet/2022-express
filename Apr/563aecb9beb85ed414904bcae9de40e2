The European Union (EU) fishing commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius, has now revealed that all licences requested by French boats to operate in UK coastal waters have been granted - there were thought to be around 70 left outstanding. Mr Sinkevicius said: "The commission fully intends to continue building a successful and constructive relationship with the UK. "We managed to achieve most of the licences that have been requested."  Brexiteers have claimed that the development backtracks on the agreement struck in 2020, which looked to ensure the UK’s share of fishing quotas in its waters jumped by 25 percent from 2021 to 2026. However, in that time the Government has allowed French vessels who had previously fished in British waters, six to 12 miles from the coast, to continue doing so. Britain and France have been feuding ever since over how many licences should be granted to French fishermen. So, do you believe Boris Johnson has sacrificed too much ground to the French?
