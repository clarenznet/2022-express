And while nations worldwide debate what more we can all do, our nation is leading the push for more and better practical military help. But there is more to helping than military assistance. More than ten million Ukrainians have fled their homes. Of those, an astonishing four million have left the country. Helping Ukraine also means helping Ukrainian refugees. We Brits have opened our hearts and homes. The Disasters Emergency Committee appeal alone has raised over Â£260million, and more than 200,000 of us have registered to offer rooms to refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Across the country, so many of us are determined to do whatever we can to help. The Daily Express has set up a website - express.co.uk/Ukraine - intended as a "one-stop shop" for Ukrainians when they reach the UK. It would be a heartwarming tale to tell were it not for one fact. As of last Friday, while 32,000 Ukrainians had applied to come to the UK, only 5,200 had been granted visas. Worse still, just 500 had actually made it across - a shocking 1.6 per cent of those whose applications were registered. The explanation is simple and comprises three words: the Home Office. This department has, almost singlehandedly, turned a story of British resolve and generosity into one of administrative chaos. Sad to say, for decades the Home Office has been a byword for incompetence and bureaucratic nightmares. Successive Home Secretaries have been withering about its officials and the department's unmanageability. In 2006, Labour Home Secretary John Reid infamously declared it "not fit for purpose". It is no wonder the Windrush scandal centred on the Home Office, which wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights to hundreds of citizens. I spent a number of months in and around the Home Office from 2001-04 when David Blunkett was Home Secretary, researching my biography of the Labour politician. And I saw how dysfunctional much of the department was. Mr Blunkett and his aides would tell me with increasing frustration, often turning to anger, how impossible the staff, department and - crucially - the agencies attached to it were. It is difficult to imagine or to overstate how bad the Home Office is, and for how long it has been that way. If it can get something wrong, it will. If it can destroy something, it will. And many of its senior officials have been the very worst in Whitehall - it has been treated as a dumping ground for them. Take the Homes for Ukraine scheme - an immediate success as Brits offered up their houses and Ukrainians asked to come here. Then the Home Office got to work. The application form alone is 51 pages long. It includes questions such as "are you a war criminal?". The forms are taking weeks to process when they need to be done in hours. As current Home Secretary, Priti Patel is rightly held responsible. But this misses the point. The real culpability is that she has utterly failed to reform the department in her time there - to tackle the bureaucratic quicksand into which everything sinks, and to reform the mindset of officials who behave as if their role is to stop policy being implemented rather than accelerate it. But to blame Ms Patel is unfair. Yes, she has failed to take hold of her department - but so has every other Home Secretary for decades. None succeeded in changing the landscape. The failure to tackle the Channel migrant issue is one unresolved matter. In the short term, the focus must be on speeding up and smoothing out the processing of Ukrainian refugees. In that respect, making former MP Lord Harrington the dedicated refugees minister is sensible.  As she has put it: "I want to get the process down to a reasonable amount of time. My target is 48 hours from when they download the form to when they are given permission to travel." But until the Home Office is reformed, we are doomed to face such chaos across other areas for which it is responsible. The Home Office needs a minister who understands how to change Whitehall from top to bottom, with the heft and agility to take wounding decisions necessary for long term success. My suggestion would be to make Michael Gove Home Secretary. And then let him get on with the job. 'More than ten million Ukrainians have had to flee their homes'
