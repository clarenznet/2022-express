The 31-year-old dancer, who first joined the BBC One programme in 2015, picked up the Glitterball trophy with Rose Ayling-Ellis last year. The actress, 27, was the first deaf contestant on the show and, during couple’s choice week, the pair performed a routine in which they paused the music and danced in silence.  Pernice is now the longest-serving male professional in the current line-up. Johannes Radebe, Nadiya Bychkova, Dianne Buswell and Graziano Di Prima are also returning. Fellow pros Aljaz Skorjanec and Oti Mabuse have left Strictly. Anton Du Beke last year swapped the dancefloor for the judging panel. The BBC has not yet said if he will be returning as a judge or professional dancer in the forthcoming series.
