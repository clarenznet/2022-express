The soaring cost of energy has combined with labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions to drive up inflation in many countries. Britain’s 6.2 percent is a 30-year record and is more than three times the Bank of England’s two percent target. Christian Nolting, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, highlighted US consumer price rises breaching the seven percent threshold. “The rhino in the room has been unleashed and may now prove difficult to stop,” he said. “In the developed economies, already elevated inflation rates may now be driven even higher given the conflict-induced oil and gas price shock. “Sanctions as well as businesses halting their operations in Russia are exacerbating supply-chain problems.” In the eurozone inflation surged to 7.5 percent in March. The figure across the 19-country bloc accelerated from 5.9 percent in February, Eurostat said, far beyond the 6.6 percent expected. The war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel prices to record highs. Food, services and durable goods all came in above the European Central Bank’s two percent target. Germany meanwhile is attempting to wean itself off piped Russian gas by importing liquefied gas from Qatar. ECB chief economist Philip Lane said there were opposing forces on prices. “We have the energy shock, the prospects of second-round effects, pushing up inflation,” he told CNBC. “On the other hand, the weakening of sentiment, the fact that real incomes will suffer with the high energy prices will have a negative pressure on the inflation outlook.” Susannah Streeter, analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown, added investors were worried “that inflation will fly up above current sky-high forecasts”.
