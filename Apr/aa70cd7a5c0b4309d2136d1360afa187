Raquel Rosario- Sanchez, 32, said Bristol University failed to protect her from a "hate campaign" in 2018 as she studied for a PhD.  But her attempt to sue it for negligence, breach of contract and sex discrimination was dismissed by Judge Alexander Ralton at the Bristol Civil and Family Justice Centre. Ms Rosario-Sanchez said the outcome was "unexpected", while the university said it was "pleased" at the result.
