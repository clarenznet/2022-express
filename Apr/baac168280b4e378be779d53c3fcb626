  Andrea McLean has opened up about the financial “punch in the stomach” that happened to her after quitting Loose Women. The star described how “every brand dropped her” as soon as she announced she was leaving the ITV show.    Andrea, 52, has spoken candidly about the financial impact of her decision to quite Loose Women. The TV star made the announcement that she was leaving the ITV programme in 2020, explaining that the coronavirus pandemic had caused her to reassess her life. Andrea worked on getting her online membership lifestyle company This Girl Is On Fire off the ground and had other corporate work lined up. However, she admitted that when a number of brands dropped her she felt like her “safety net was gone”.

That’s how big a deal it is walking away from TV. "For me, financially it was a punch in the stomach, because my safety net was gone.     “I can’t turn back and I can't change my mind because I still want to do this thing." Andrea went on to point out the irony that the very brands that had dropped her after her Loose Women exit, which she didn't name, were centred around raising women up and improving their confidence. “But actually they didn’t care about that, they only cared about my profile,” she added during her interview with Secure The Insecure podcast.

The star recently confessed that she sold her beloved Surrey home with the hopes of spending winters in Florida. Andrea, who now lives in a rented house with third husband, Nick Feeney, and her two children Finlay, 20, and Amy, 15, admitted she felt forced to sell the house “before it became an issue". She said: “We have only moved a mile away because Amy is still at school. We sold our house to invest the money in the business.       “It was scary but we did it before it became an issue. We thought, ‘this is not happening as quickly as we liked’. “It was emotional because that was the house I bought when I got divorced and it was my home for nearly 10 years, but it was the right thing to do. We want to be mobile,” she continued. “One of the good things about the pandemic is that it has made us realise we can literally be anywhere. We are booked to go to Florida for at least a month to try it out,” she told the Sunday Post. The latest episode of the Secure The Insecure podcast is available on multiple streaming platforms.
