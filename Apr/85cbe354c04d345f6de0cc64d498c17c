This can only compound his failure to challenge the Government on its Immigration Bill, its handling of the cost-of-living crisis, Britain’s post-Covid economic recovery and the war in Ukraine. Surely the whole point of Her Majesty’s Opposition is to hold the Government to account and scrutinise its policies and manifesto pledges. The point is surely not to engage in endless posturing and political point scoring. Roy Daniels, Luton, Beds ---------------------------------------------- Forthright Freddy is doing a better job than Sir Keir What I like about Frederick Forsyth is he not only tells this country, the Government, what they are doing wrong but also offers wonderful solutions which would save us money, pollution and make us look good to the rest of the world, and work really well. Please Frederick, run for prime minister. We need you so badly to sort our country out. This is exactly what Keir Starmer should be doing but he has no idea how to put this county back on track. He is only good at trying to dish the dirt. June Irwin, Chester   ---------------------------------------------- Here’s your starter for 10, put Fred in Downing Street I am by no means the first to wish the sainted Frederick Forsyth was head of our government (April 22). On the announcements that partygate is to undergo another investigation and Rwanda is to take responsibility for Channel migrants, our Fred can be relied upon to speak sense. Get him into No. 10. Carole Burton, Lichfield, Staffs ---------------------------------------------- Have ITV got snooze for you with extended bulletin Recently ITV News has been extended from 30 minutes to one hour. What a mistake. Topical items were promised but what do we get? Breathless Mary Nightingale, dreary Robert Peston, and various reporters harping on about partygate again and again.
