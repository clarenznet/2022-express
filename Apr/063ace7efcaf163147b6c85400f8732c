It's not our fault that we were born when we were and the people who raised us were generally more sensible back then, having lived through a war. It seems that scientists and academics justify their existence and sponsorship deals by carrying out surveys and reports about almost anything. Those of us who were born after the Second World War, whose parents had gone through an enormous amount and helped to rebuild the world after the tragedies, are now being blamed for the state the planet is in. This is, of course, totally wrong: we lived by the rules and the morals of the time. As humans continue to overpopulate the planet, things are going to be different. But net zero is a ridiculous idea that will never work. We need to build more homes, but not on floodplains. We have to safeguard the oceans, plant more trees and clean the world up, but aiming for a net carbon future is just ridiculous. I And the scientists who keep on preaching doom and gloom should be questioned a lot more than they have been, because let's all remember that science changes continually. That's the way to make the future of the planet great.
