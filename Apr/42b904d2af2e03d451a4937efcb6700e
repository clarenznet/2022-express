The legal system should not have allowed this terrorist to be represented by any barrister. He should have been instructed to enter a guilty plea rather than pursuing a trial at a great cost to the British taxpayer. I know people will say that every person has a right to a defence but this should never have got that far. An innocent man working for the good of this country was murdered by a terrorist who should rot in hell. -------------------------------- Prospect of prosecution won’t stop madman Putin It comes as no surprise that Russia’s invasion has plumbed new depths (“Putin ‘drops chemical agent on besieged city’”, April 12). What is being ordered by Putin resembles Nazi Germany. It’ll take more than the threat of war crime prosecutions to stop this madman. Roy Daniels, Luton, Beds -------------------------------- MP should not be allowed to question legal integrity For once I agree with Labour for calling for action against Crispin Blunt for his disgraceful message defending MP Imran Ahmad Khan (“Tory MP apologises and retracts statement defending sex offender Khan after backlash”, April 12). No matter what Crispin Blunt’s private thoughts may be, we have to believe in the fairness and integrity of our justice system. Jean Norfolk, Knottingley, W Yorks -------------------------------- Refugee delay is chance to keep our country safe I can understand the frustration over the delay in processing Ukrainian refugees but the mayhem is such a great opportunity for terrorists and the like to slip through the net (“Frustrated Patel says refugees will come”, April 9). Hopefully this is one of the reasons for the delay as we must keep our country safe.
