Kim Leadbeater MP has warned the culture around politics has to change to stop people being “drawn towards extremes”. The reality of public-serving politicians has been shaken by the recent killings of Jo Cox and Sir David Amess, with the latter’s killer Ali Harbi Ali found guilty of murder today. Ms Leadbeater said that despite the conviction, the threats facing politicians have not “got any better” and British culture must be examined to protect against further deaths. Speaking to Sky News, the MP said: “Sadly, I’m not sure things have got any better over the last few years since Jo was murdered.“We see a lot of abuse, intimidation and threats directed at people in public life and we all have to work to try and change that, including politicians ourselves.“But also, let’s be clear, Sir David and Jo were murdered by political extremists.“We also have to look at what is going on in our society that is drawing people to the extremes.“I don’t think the two are separate. The culture around politics is an important part of the kind of society we want so that people are not drawn towards those kinds of extremes. Her comments follow the conviction of 26-year-old Ali for the murder of Sir David Amess on October 15 last year.The Conservative politician was brutally stabbed 21 times while hosting a meeting with his Southend West constituents.He died within an hour despite swift medical attention.During the hearing today, Ali reportedly refused to stand during the reading of the verdict, with the jury taking only 18 minutes to convict him.
