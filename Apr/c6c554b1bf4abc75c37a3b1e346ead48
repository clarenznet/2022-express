Frank Robert James, 62 was arrested in the East Village neighbourhood of New York City earlier today after a 24-hour manhunt. He was named as the only suspect related to the incident, which took place during rush hour on Tuesday. Speaking about the arrest, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said: "My fellow New Yorkers. We got him. We got him. "I cannot thank the men and women of the New York City Police Department enough, as well as the federal agents and our state police and first responders â€” from the 911 operators to the various state and medical professions, we got him." Ten people were shot and as many as 19 others were injured in a Brooklyn subway station. According to New York authorities, the shooter put on a gas mask, deployed a gas canister and began shooting. Earlier today, the force named Mr James as a "person of interest" in the case. They offered a reward of up to $50,000 for anyone who could provide information about him. They said: "The 62-year-old Frank Robert James is WANTED in connection with firing numerous gunshots inside of a subway car causing serious injuries to ten victims. "The perpetrator is known to have ties in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio. "There's a reward up to $50,000 for info leading to the arrest & indictment of this person." The suspect was linked to the attack through a rented U-Haul van, after the key was found at the scene. A gun, magazines, gas canisters and fireworks were also recovered from the scene. Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the station, surrounded by clouds of smoke. The NYPD has said they do not believe the shooting to be an act of terrorism. New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said: "An individual donned a gas mask, he then opened fire striking multiple people on the subway and on the platform. "This is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time."
