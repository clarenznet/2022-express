   Location, Location, Location star Kirstie Allsopp knocked heads in a fierce Twitter spat with Nadine Dorries over the privatisation of Channel 4, which airs several of Kirstie's programmes. The pair locked horns after the Culture Secretary wrote an opinion piece addressing the Government’s decision to push ahead with plans to sell off the channel.   Nadine, 64, told the British public that it was time for Channel 4 to “fly the nest towards a very exciting future”. In her piece, Nadine wrote that former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who set up Channel 4 in 1982, had ultimately wanted it to be “free from the constraints of the state” and described opposition to the move as “lazy, overwrought and ill-informed rhetoric from the Leftie luvvie lynch mob”. Kirstie, 50, who has been a long-time employee of the broadcaster, took to Twitter to disagree with the minister’s decision in view of her 427,000 followers. Yesterday, Kirstie shared Nadine’s article, writing: “Some of the language directed @nadinedorries has been vile 100%.

Sharing an article about the US Senate passing an anti-lynching Bill, she added: “This piece might make you think twice about using the term.”    Reacting to Nadine’s decision last week, Kirstie penned: “This is a load of utter twaddle! “No true Conservative would sell Channel 4, Lady T will be spinning in her grave. “C4 was set up to foster the British film & TV industry and it has done that job admirably. “Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party & country.” READ MORE...

She wrote: “Channel 4 rightly holds a cherished place in British life and I want that to remain the case. “I have come to the conclusion that government ownership is holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. “A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future.      “I will set out the future plan for Channel 4 in a White Paper in due course,” she continued. “I will seek to reinvest the proceeds of the sale into levelling up the creative sector, putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country - delivering a creative dividend for all.” The Government confirmed last week that it will proceed with plans to privatise Channel 4. The channel has been publicly owned since it was founded in 1982 and is currently funded by advertising.
