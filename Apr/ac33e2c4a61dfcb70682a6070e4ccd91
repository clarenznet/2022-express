Emergency services dashed to the café in Liverpool city centre at around 5.50pm on Saturday following reports an 18-year-old man had been "assaulted". The man was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Forensic officers have been pictured at the scene today as they investigate the death, which is being treated as a murder investigation. A woman who works nearby told Liverpool Echo: "I heard screaming and shouting coming from the café. "The next thing the police turned up. That is all I know." Other locals seemed baffled by the incident, which happened in broad daylight. About 12 police cars and vans were seen by the café on Saturday evening. Police vehicles and officers were also seen outside the Royal Liverpool Hospital some time later, according to witnesses. Merseyside Police confirmed these presences were linked. Speaking yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector Terry Davies said: "It is with great sadness that we confirm that an 18-year-old male has died following an incident in Liverpool city centre this evening (Saturday 16 April). "We are in the very early stages of the investigation as we seek to establish what has taken place and who was involved. "At the time of the incident, London Road would have been busy with people so I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity this evening at around 5.30pm onwards that saw or heard anything suspicious, or may have captured anything significant on their mobile phone, dashcam and CCTV to contact us as a matter of urgency."
