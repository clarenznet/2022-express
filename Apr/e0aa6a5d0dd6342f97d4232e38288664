Concerns were raised after claims of cocaine use and sexual misconduct by MP David Warburton, who has had the Tory whip removed. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson revealed she has never witnessed drug-taking on the parliamentary estate but said: "It would appear that there is a problem." She added: "What troubles me the most is the ongoing issues where it comes to sexual harassment." "We do have an independent process now and that is a welcome step. That people who have concerns and complaints to make do come forward, that those complaints are taken seriously and action is taken." Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) is looking into allegations made by two women about Mr Warburton. A Sunday newspaper claimed the MP took cocaine and behaved inappropriately. The case has also raised fresh concerns about the practice of MPs employing spouses on their staff as Mr Warburton's wife Harriet handles HR in his office. But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, who also employs his wife, said the system means "if anything the taxpayer gets more bang for their buck" as spouses will work around the clock."
