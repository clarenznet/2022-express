Sharing it with his 2.7 million TikTok followers, Mason ends the clip by performing the famous Spider-Man web shooter pose, as a homage to his favourite superhero character, and removing the mask to unveil himself. The Marvel mega fan teamed up with Sony Pictures to mark the home entertainment release of Spider-Man: No Way Home. And 23-year-old Mason is such a fan, he is even considering a future move to appear on the big screen – if he was offered a role in a future Spider-Man movie. He said: “There’s still a lot I need to achieve on the pitch, but maybe one day. Watch this space! “Of course, I love the action, but for this movie in particular there’s some jaw-dropping moments that will live forever in cinema history – and the all-star cast, too. “TikTok for me is all about having fun, and I jumped at the chance to be a part of this epic release.” Spider-Man: No Way Home has dominated the global box office, positioning it as the biggest superhero film of all time in the UK. It is currently the fourth highest-grossing movie in the UK, with stars Tom Holland and Zendaya reprising their roles. It is released on 4k Ultra HD, Blu-Ray and DVD on 4 April, with up to 80 minutes of extras including bloopers, behind-the-scenes moments, and Easter eggs.
