Frustrated would-be hosts have compiled a list since the scheme started on March 18. They include 622 who applied for visas in week one. Community groups, who protested outside Parliament yesterday, believe the real figures are much higher. Marlow Ukraine Collective consists of 45 host families sponsoring 123 Ukrainians - but only 19 visas had been granted. Kate Clarkson, 68, a retired nurse from Manchester, said: "I am now ashamed to be British because of the way we are treating people." The Government said 21,600 Ukrainians had arrived here so far, with thousands of visas a day now being processed by the Home Office.
