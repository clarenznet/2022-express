Putin has slapped sanctions on 13 British politicians, banning them from entering the country. He accused them of "inciting the Neo-Nazi Kiev regime", claiming that Britain's Russophobia is detrimental to the British people. Also on the list are Dominic Raab, Ben Wallace, Grant Shapps, Kwasi Kwarteng, Nadine Dorries, James Heappey, Nicola Sturgeon, Suella Braverman and Theresa May. The Russian foreign ministry said the move was taken "in view of the unprecedented hostile action by the British government, in particular the imposition of sanctions against senior Russian officials". The UK has put in place a severe package of sanctions on Russian individuals, businesses and financial institutions. The Government has estimated that up to Â£275bn worth of Russian assets are currently frozen - equivalent to 60 percent of Russian foreign currency reserves. It said that Russia is "heading for the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union" as a result of the sanctions. UPDATES TO FOLLOW...
