When the 95-year-old monarch celebrates her Platinum Jubilee, many Brits will see her deploy her signature regal wave. However, Her Majesty had been given a helping hand by a group of Australian students when she visited the land Down Under some sixty years ago. Princess Anne recalled the story back in 1980 during an appearance on the TV chat show programme Parkinson. She said: "There were still one or two sort of noisy students about in those days – the end of the sixties, you know. "There was this slightly noisy group on arrival, and we thought what are they up to. "And three of them pushed out of the crowd with this hand and it was a sort of stuffed glove, for want of a better expression, with a joint.

The Princess Royal added: "And the Queen took it from them and said 'Thank you very much, that is what I’ve always wanted!' "And their faces literally dropped because this wasn’t quite the reaction they’d expected!" When Sir Michael Parkinson asked what had happened to the hand, Anne claimed it had since been lost, adding that she suspected someone else in the Firm's "sense of humour perhaps didn't stretch as far as ours".
