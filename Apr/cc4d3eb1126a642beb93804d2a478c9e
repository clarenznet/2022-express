Dolet Hill, 64, her partner Denton Burke, 58, her daughter Tanysha Ofori-Akuffo 45, and Tanysha's daughter Samantha Drummonds, 27, were knifed to death early on Monday. A man aged 28, who was found in the same house as the victims, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Police say the suspect, from Lewisham, south-east London, is in a stable condition in hospital. Officers tasered him at the scene. They were called to Dolet's home in nearby Bermondsey at 1.40 am and forced their way in. All four victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Yesterday Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust in London paid tribute to former colleague Dolet, who had two daughters. Alastair Gourlay, director of estates and facilities, said: "We are devastated to hear about the tragic death of Dolet, who worked as a housekeeping assistant in our pharmacy department for more than 21 years, before her retirement in 2018. "Dolet was a well-respected colleague, who also helped to improve the workplace for others as an active Unison representative." It is thought that Tanysha was a district nurse and that Samantha, who lived in nearby Forest Hill, worked for NatWest. Mr Burke's sister Juleth Hutchinson said he worked as a chef in Jamaica before moving to Britain about 25 years ago "for a better life". Tanysha's husband Danny said last night: "I can't live without her. I don't know where I'm going to start my life. I'm too totally destroyed. "I don't think I can live with any woman again. All I know is that I have lost something very, very, very good, something dear to my heart. I've got a deep hole in my heart."
