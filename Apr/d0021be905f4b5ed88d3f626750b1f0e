The amount of money spent on road upkeep by councils across the UK has been revealed by a freedom of information request, with some spending almost twenty times more maintaining roads than others. The request was put in by Car Leasing Special Offers, and manager Will Bullen told Express.co.uk exclusively: “For many drivers, the state of the roads has a big impact on their driving, whether it be from doing smaller commutes or longer driving stints. “Road issues, such as potholes, can not only cause damage to your vehicle but also be expensive to fix, which is not ideal in a time where the cost of living is rising. “As part of our research, we uncovered which councils are spending the most and least on fixing up the UK’s roads. “Leeds Council was spending the most money overall, spending over £20millon on developing the city’s roads, with an even higher budget for 2022. “While at the other end of the scale, it was Coventry council that spent the least at £1,247,713.” READ MORE: Driver who queued for 17 minutes to pay for parking gets fined £270 Elsewhere in the findings, Bolton Council spent the most money on highway works and maintenance with the total cost at £4,623,000.
