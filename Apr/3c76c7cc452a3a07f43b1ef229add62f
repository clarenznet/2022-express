Lewis Dawson, 18, took goods worth £1,500 from the family home and sold them on for just £200 so he could go out to the cinema and buy meals. A court heard Dawson also stole and sold a Nintendo DS video console, which belonged to his younger brother.  The teenager, from Thornaby-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, has no previous convictions. Daniel Burke, defending, said: "He would state that his parents forced him to join the army when he was 16. It was not something he wanted to do. He spent the next two years trying to leave the Army, but he couldn't." He said Dawson left the forces when he turned 18 as he was unhappy doing the job, but that this decision upset the teenager's mother Mr Burke said: "He says his mother never forgave him for it and there was quite a lot of tension and friction. That is no excuse for what he did." Dawson pleaded guilty to theft at the first opportunity. The case was adjourned for sentencing.
