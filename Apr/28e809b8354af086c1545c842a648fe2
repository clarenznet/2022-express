Speaking to host Nick Ferrari on LBC, Lord Frost said that if he were to grade "the Brexit we delivered" he would give it an "A-" as there is still work to be done in Northern Ireland. However, he said he would give the way the Government is taking advantage of Brexit a B grade, adding that a lot more needs to be done. Lord Frost urged the Minister for Brexit opportunities Mr Rees-Mogg to take advantage of planning rules, procurement, labour market, tariffs and free trade deals to allow the UK to get the most out of Brexit.
