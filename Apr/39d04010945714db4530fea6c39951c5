The singer-songwriter, 31, also argued "baseless" lawsuits were damaging the music industry and said he had "suffered" as a father, husband and son. The Grammy Award-winning star was accused of lifting a refrain for his 2017 hit Shape Of You from grime artist Sami Chokri - but the claim was dismissed by the Honourable Mr Justice Zacaroli.  In the video, shared on Instagram minutes after his win, Sheeran, said: "Claims like this are way too common now - where a claim is made with the idea that settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there's no basis for the claim. "It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. I don't want to take anything away from the pain and hurt suffered from both sides of this case.  "But I just want to say I'm not an entity, I'm not a corporation, I'm a human being, I'm a father, I'm a husband, I'm a son. Lawsuits are not a pleasant experience. "I hope this ruling means baseless claims like this can be avoided. This really does have to end." Sheeran was also speaking on behalf of collaborators John McDaid and Steven McCutcheon who insisted they had never heard Chokri's 2015 OhWhy. Sheeran added: "Me, Johnny and Steve are very grateful for all the support sent to us by fellow songwriters over the last few weeks. "Hopefully we can all get back to writing songs rather than having to prove that we can write them."
