Lord David Frost was responding to a tweet from the author Bruno Macaes, who had criticised those who believed “Brexit would weaken Europe vis a vis Russia." He said: “We spent years worrying about and discussing the wrong problems”. Lord Frost answered back that he would agree if the tweet was aimed at “EU decision-takers, especially in Paris, Berlin and Brussels”.  The UK’s former chief Brexit negotiator added: “If they had spent less time trying to get the UK to change its mind on Brexit, & more time worrying about the other neighbours, we might all be in a better position now.” Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has suspended the opening of a major Russian gas pipeline - Nord Stream Two. Like many countries in Europe, Germany is heavily reliant on Russia for its stocks of natural gas - Independent Chemical and Energy Market Intelligence (ICIS) data showed Russian gas accounted for 32 percent of its supply last December. So, do you agree with Lord Frost and should the EU have spent less time obsessing over Brexit? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
