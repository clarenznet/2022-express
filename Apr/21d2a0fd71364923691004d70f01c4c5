Judges for the Sunday Times also approved of the sports clubs and opportunities for young people in the town, which is north of Bradford and Leeds. Slaithwaite, also in God’s own country, topped the North and North East section of the guide’s separate list of regional winners. The Isle of Bute was named as the finest place to live in Scotland and Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, was placed first for Wales. The newspaper’s panel pored over contenders’ assets from transport, schools and broadband to culture, green spaces and the health of the high street. Helen Davies, the Times and Sunday Times property editor, said: “The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list is necessarily subjective. “Leave it just to statistics and you will never capture the spirit of a place. “For that, you need to visit to take into account that ‘you have to be here’ feeling. Is the pub dog-friendly? Can you live car-free? What are the schools and houses like? “Is it multicultural and multigenerational – and can it offer a good way of life to lots of different sorts of people?” The comprehensive guide was released online yesterday.
