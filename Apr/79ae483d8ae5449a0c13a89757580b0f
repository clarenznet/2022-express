The poor animals were left locked in the cages of an animal shelter in Borodyanka, Ukraine. On Friday, April 1st, after Borodyanka was liberated from the Russian occupiers, volunteers were able to get to the shelter, where they witnessed the devastating scene.  Of the 485 dogs living in the shelter, only 150 survived, the animal rights organisation UAnimals reported. Another 27 animals were found in terrible condition, some barely able to walk or even move their heads. These dogs were transferred to clinics to receive treatment. Several dogs did not reach the clinics and died on the way, in the hands of volunteers, UAnimals said.
