A massive acceleration in the pursuit of homegrown energy to bolster the country's independence will be promised in the Prime Minister's British Energy Security Strategy. A wide range of energy sources - including wind, solar, hydrogen, oil and gas - are to be expanded under the plan. And up to eight nuclear power plants could be built to generate a quarter of the country's electricity supply by 2050. The document will also set a new aim of ensuring all UK electricity is low carbon by the end of the decade. Mr Johnson said last night: "We're setting out bold plans to scale up and accelerate affordable, clean and secure energy made in Britain, for Britain, in the decade ahead. This will reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills." His strategy follows eye-watering rises in fuel bills following global shortages made worse by the war in Ukraine. Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow climate change secretary, said: "Boris Johnson's own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar - the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power."
