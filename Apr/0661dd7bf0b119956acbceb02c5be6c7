  Former Countryfile host Helen Skelton previously revealed she was feeling “isolated” after moving to France for her husband Riche Myler's career in a resurfaced interview. The Springtime on the Farm presenter announced she and her husband of eight years had separated late on Monday night.      Helen, 38, took to social media two nights ago to share the heartbreaking news of her split from Richie, 31. The sad announcement came just four months after the BBC star had given birth to their third child, daughter Elsie Kate. Helen has previously opened up about the “crushing loneliness” she felt after moving to France to support her rugby player husband’s career. The couple moved back in 2015, when Richie switched rugby teams to the Catalan Dragons, who are based in Perpignan, France.

They thought I was bonkers,” she told The Daily Mail's You Magazine. Helen and Richie married in 2013, and share Ernie, six, Louis, five and Elsie Kate, four months. She has previously revealed that the traumatic birth of her second child had made her third and “final” pregnancy more difficult. In 2017, the star gave birth to her son Louis on the kitchen floor with only her eldest child Ernie for company, as Richie was in England at the time. READ MORE...

All of this was revealed before Helen took to Instagram on Monday night to inform her 276,000 followers that she and Richie had parted ways. In an emotional social media post, she told fans that she had separated from her husband after nine years of marriage. She wrote: “Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple.     “He has left the family home,” she continued. “We will be doing our best to co parent our small children,” she added with broken heart emojis. Helen is a television presenter, best known for appearing on Countryfile, while Richie plays as a scrum-half and fullback for Leeds Rhinos, as well as for England on an international level. Richie is yet to make a statement on the pair’s split.
