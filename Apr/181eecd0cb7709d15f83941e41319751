The near 184,000 offences was up more than a fifth on the previous 12 months, with rape accounting for 37 percent of the figure, the Office for National Statistics revealed. Campaigners say the spike in recorded offences highlights both an increasing willingness of victims to come forward - and "unprecedented levels of need" for specialist support services for victims. The ONS crime figures published yesterday showed police-recorded sexual offences in the year to December 2021 stood at 183,587. The number was up 22 percent in 2020 (150,748) and up 13 percent compared with 2019 (163,067). In total, 37 percent of sexual offences recorded (67,125) were rapes - a 21 percent increase compared with 55,592 in the previous 12 months to December 2020. The ONS said: "While violence and sexual offences recorded by the police have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, theft offences and robbery remain at a lower level despite increases over the last nine months."
