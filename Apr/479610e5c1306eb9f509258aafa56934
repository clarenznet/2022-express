JUST IN: Andrew clinging on 'to what time is left' before Charles takes throne — expert speculates Despite Harry and Meghan’s departure from the Firm in 2020, Eugenie is said to have remained close to her “favourite cousin” and his wife.The princess and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, are the only members of the Royal Family who have visited the Sussexes in their home in Montecito, California.Eugenie is known to have played an important role in Meghan and Harry’s relationship, and was the first member of the family to know about the romance.Now, a royal biographer has claimed that Eugenie even “orchestrated” the first meeting between Meghan and the Queen. In her new book entitled, ‘The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor, the Truth and the Turmoil’, Tina Brown wrote: “The Queen met with Meghan after attending church at Windsor, in an informal ‘drop by’ at Royal Lodge, orchestrated, doubtless, by Harry’s favourite cousin, [Prince] Andrew and Fergie’s [Sarah Ferguson] daughter Princess Eugenie, for whom the Queen has a soft spot.”She goes on to say Her Majesty “made the conversation easy and reserved judgement.”Ms Brown wrote: “She [the Queen] was just happy Harry was happy.”While the close bond between Eugenie and Harry was proven to be intact following the princess’ visit to the US, the statuses of the Duke’s relationships with other members of the Royal Family were not as clear.

Harry spoke affectionately of his meeting with the Queen, saying it was “great to see her”.In an interview with NBC’s Today show that aired last week, Harry said: “Being with her, it was great. It was just so nice to see her.”He continued: “She’s always got a great sense of humour with me.“We have a really special relationship. We talk about things that she can’t talk about with anybody else.” One royal expert has claimed the recent meeting between the Sussexes and Her Majesty may have also been orchestrated by Eugenie.Jonathan Sacerdoti told Us Weekly last week: “Princess Eugenie is a peacemaker.“Eugenie may have been the person to suggest the meeting… or to try and help arrange it, make the contact.”Mr Sacerdoti added: “She’s obviously maintained these good relations with Harry and Meghan, visiting them in California when she was out there and publicly being seen with them. “She’s also said to be close to the Queen as well, and that would put her in the perfect position to broker that sort of meeting.” Eugenie and Jack live in the Sussexes’ UK residence — Frogmore Cottage — with their son, August.The couples are known to have spent time with each other’s children, potentially making Eugenie and Jack the only members of the Royal Family who have met Meghan and Harry’s daughter — Lilibet Diana.The Queen is reportedly desperate to meet her namesake in-person.The upcoming Platinum Jubilee may provide the perfect opportunity for Her Majesty to finally be introduced.
