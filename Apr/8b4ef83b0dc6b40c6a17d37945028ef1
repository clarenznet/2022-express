An angry fan invaded the pitch after his side lost 2-1 to teach his goalkeeper how to become a better shot-stopper to the disbelief of 20,000 home fans. The supporter displayed his acrobatic skills as he dived into the air in the six-yard box while the real keeper watched closely on one knee. He continued to demonstrate his goal-saving techniques as he was led away from embarrassed Klever Rodrigo Gomes Rufino before appearing to get into an animated conversation with a police officer who let him continue walking back towards the stands. Every one of his imaginary saves was cheered by the home fans despite their team dropping three points. It was not until the entertaining supporter was met by riot police as he left the pitch that he was made to turn around and was marched back towards the players’ tunnel with an arm forced behind his back in an obvious sign he was about to be arrested. The surreal scenes happened after the final whistle of a Brazilian fourth-division match between Santa Cruz and ASA in Arruda Stadium in the north east Brazilian city of Recife. The home side equalised after an early ASA goal before the away side scored again, leaving them top of the Serie D league and Santa Cruz in seventh place. The footage of the unexpected goalkeeping display showed the fan’s white bucket hat going in one direction as he dived into the air the opposite way a couple of feet from the Santa Cruz goalie. Shot-stopper Klever, who had obviously not impressed the supporter with his performance, watched on in silence before picking himself up and leaving the pitch with the belongings he had left behind the goal. The man held by police, who was wearing shorts and flip-flops, repeatedly raised his arms in the air as if to say: ‘It’s easy, this is how you do it.’ It was not immediately clear if he had been formally arrested after his display and what the outcome had been.
