The sombre tolls at the town hall, which began shortly after 3.06pm, were for each victim of the tragedy at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final. The city then observed a minute's silence at the same time the match was officially halted as the scale of the disaster unfolded at the stadium in Sheffield.  The 97 fans were killed after a crush developed in the stands during the match on April 15 1989. Liverpool players and staff, including manager Jurgen Klopp and captain Jordan Henderson, laid wreaths at the Anfield memorial yesterday. Kop legends Ian Rush, 60, and Sir Kenny Dalglish, 71, and Liverpool FC communications director Susan Black also laid a tribute. Flags were flown at half-mast from council buildings and LiverpoolTown Hall was lit up in red last night.  A spokesman for the Anfield club said: "April 15 will always be a very significant and poignant date in the club's history and one that brings the LFC family together in remembrance and thought." Lord Mayor of Liverpool Mary Rasmussen said: "We have always pledged never to forget those who lost their lives as a result of that tragic day 33 years ago. In doing so, we honour their memory and stand in solidarity with their families." Football clubs and celebrities, including comedian Russell Brand, 46, also paid tribute.  Manchester United tweeted "You'll Never Walk Alone" and player Marcus Rashford, 24, added a red heart emoji and the words "Never forgotten". Brand said: "I'll never forget the lessons this tragedy taught us." Former Reds stars Jose Enrique and Jamie Carragher also uploaded tributes to Twitter. In a tweet local rivals Everton posted: "We were - and remain - a city united in its grief."
