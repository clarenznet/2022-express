Chrissy Teigen has been showing off her swimwear looks as she enjoyed some downtime with her family as they spend some time in Hawaii. The model, who is married to musician John Legend, didn't appear pleased with the odd tan lines caused by her bikini. Taking to Instagram stories, the 36-year-old decided to share a photo of her revelation in a nude selfie. The famous star went nude in a topless display as she gave her 37.5 million followers a glimpse of her unmissable tan lines. Chrissy appeared naked in a bathroom selfie that she took in front of the mirror. She held her phone up so that it obscured her face, and she had her free arm covering her bust. Just below, she had a tread-like pattern with darker squares of tanned skin, which were broken up by slim horizontal and vertical stripes. She sarcastically captioned the snap: "This is great." Chrissy has been sharing a number of photos of her family getaway with her husband John, 43, and their children Luna, six, and Miles, three.
