Barbra Streisand, 79, set pulses running in a series of stills from her 1970 film The Owl and the Pussycat. The legendary actress could be seen wearing a quirky sheer pyjama set. Her outfit featured a polka dot pattern and diamantés sewn into the spaghetti strap top. The unusual blouse also boasted a pattern cut in the shape of hands over either breast. Barbra elegantly modelled the two-piece ensemble on set. Her long, chestnut-coloured hair had been meticulously teased in a voluminous hairstyle. In other shots from the movie, Barbra could be seen sharing an intimate scene in a bathtub with co-star George Segal.
