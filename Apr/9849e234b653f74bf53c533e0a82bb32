Brooklyn Beckham’s wife, Nicola Peltz, 27, looked the epitome of elegance in a series of throwback pictures from 2016. The billionaire heiress made a glamorous appearance at the Second Annual InStyle Awards in 2016 in a black sheer lace dress. The star-studded event was held in Los Angeles, California in 2016. Nicola opted for an all-black ensemble consisting of a sheer black dress with floral lace embellishments, paired with peep-toe strappy heels. To finish off the look, Nicola added a touch of colour with deep red nail polish. The blonde beauty chose a classic cat-eye and blush lip for her stellar red carpet appearance. Nicola, who married David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son last week, channeled the Old Hollywood glamour by styling her hair in soft waves and a side parting.
