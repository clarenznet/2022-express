Summer Downie had been drinking vodka and taking drugs before hurling four bricks through a taxi office in Manchester with 10 friends last April. Manchester Crown Court heard the terrified taxi controller at Goodwins Olympics, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, was assaulted by the yobs and had to take refuge upstairs in the 1am attack. When jobless Downie, then 17, was arrested, she said: '"I broke the window, I did fight some guy on the floor. I put a brick through the window. I know I did wrong - that's why I ran.'' But she and co-accused Wiktor Ostrowski, both now 18 - who caused £600 of damage - will each pay £200 compensation after a judge heard Downie got £230 a month in Universal Credit. Judge Rachel Smith said: "I'm not going to order the £600 be divided between you.  "I have regard to your ages and means including the fact Summer Downie is on Universal Credit. I recognise people your age are on low incomes with the increasing cost of living everyone is facing." Prosecutor Eleanor Gleeson said: "They entered the office and pushed the dispatcher. They then started to throw punches. At this point 10 people appeared...attacking shopkeepers who owned local stores across the road." Admitting affray, Downie, of Withington, and Ostrowski, of Fallowfield, were ordered to do a 30-month community order plus 200 hours of unpaid work.
