Brooklyn Beckham, 23, married billionaire heiress Nicola Peltz, 27, in a lavish ceremony at her family’s £76 million home in Florida on Saturday. According to reports Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William turned down their invitation whilst Meghan and Harry were not invited at all. William and Kate were reported to be the ultimate choice of the Beckhams, opting for the Cambridges over the Sussexes in a tough choice between the royal couples. The Beckhams opted for William and Kate because in terms of friendship, “they are the people David and Victoria are attached to”, a source claimed. An insider told The Mirror: “David and Victoria wrote to William and Kate inviting them and the family to their son’s wedding, and William replied wishing them a great deal of joy but they are unable to attend.” The source said security arrangements figured into the Cambridges turning down the invitation. They added: “David’s attachment and history go back with William and Kate and they have a very strong relationship and they were their choice of wedding guests.” They continued: “They are the people David and Victoria are attached to and it’s always been about them because they’ve had a long history together.” And in a snub to the Sussexes, the source added: “It was always about them, it was never about Meghan and Harry."
