Officers said they entered the al-Aqsa Mosque compound at the Temple Mount holy site after they were pelted with fireworks and stones. Rocks were also thrown towards the Jewish prayer area of the Western Wall in the Old City. Three Israeli officers were injured shortly before dawn yesterday, as thousands of worshippers gathered for prayers during Ramadan.  Most of the Palestinian injuries came from rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas and beatings with batons. Israel's police said: "We will not allow rioters to disrupt the prayers and disrupt public order." Violence in the region has surged recently with deaths on both sides. In a once in every 33 years event, Ramadan, the Jewish Passover festival - which started on Friday - and the Christian marking of Easter all coincide.
