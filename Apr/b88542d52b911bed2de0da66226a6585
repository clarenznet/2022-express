Aljaz Skorjanec, 32, has vowed that he is "not touching pasta till Christmas" as he shares old holiday snaps. The professional dancer posted the throwback of himself enjoying a holiday in Santorini, Greece, leaving his ripped muscled physique on full display. He wore blue shorts as he posed by the poolside at the picturesque setting. In view of his 545,000 Instagram followers, he captioned the post: "Canâ€™t wait to get back to the pools and not breathing to take photos. "This popped up as a memory.. Not touching pasta till Christmas." Many social media users took to the post's comments to compliment the ripped dancer. Gemma Atkinson said: "Flawless with or without the pasta!" Social media user MissFortuneUK added: "Enjoy your body for whatever it is right now, if it is healthy and functioning then it is beautiful x." This comes after Aljaz took to Instagram last week to share a topless pic of his wife Janette. Janette looked amazing as she walked out of the sea in pink bikini bottoms, covering her assets as she posed. Aljaz captioned the post: "Looking for a mermaid? I found mine.." Janette, warmed by his public display of affection, said: "And I found my shipwreck Prince. Love you."
