The cash support was announced in response to soaring energy bills, with local authorities due to return money to households in council tax bands A to D.  Councils are urging residents to be vigilant, saying they would never ask for bank details or payment by phone. Those who pay council tax by direct debit will receive the Government rebate automatically while others will be sent letters about the process. The Local Government Association said text, email or call scams should be reported to Action Fraud.
