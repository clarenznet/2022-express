Opting for comfort, she wore black boat shoes with a brown detail on her feet. Like her daughter Zara Tindall, the Princess Royal has never been a huge lover of towering stilettos. Instead, she will often go for a pump or kitten heel if any. Donna Bonaccorso praised this style choice on Twitter: "She is one smart lady, no five inch stilettos - flat shoes for all the walking she's be doing on this trip." To accessorise, Princess Anne went for a simple black handbag which she wore on one shoulder. Fresh-faced, the Princess appeared to be wearing very minimal makeup, with just a burgundy lip.  She wore her hair in her signature style, unveiling a pair of studded earrings. These were gold and pearl-shaped. Peeking out from beneath her collar, the Princess wore a gold chain necklace with a yellow pendant. This subtly coordinated with her skirt in an understated way.
