Leslie Hodgson had a cochlear implant op at James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough.  The retired architect from Penrith, Cumbria, has no family and lost touch with pals after going deaf 10 years ago. Surgeon Noweed Ahmad said: "Leslie walked into my clinic, told me it was his 103rd birthday and that after researching it he wanted a cochlear implant." Leslie, who will be helped by an audiologist as his hearing improves, added: "I want stem cell treatment for my eyes."
