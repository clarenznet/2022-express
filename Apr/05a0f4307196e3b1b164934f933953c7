The 75-year-old Scot was taken from HMP Edinburgh to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Wednesday. He was last hospitalised for two days in January after collapsing in his cell.   He raped and killed Polish student Angelika Kluk, 23, then hid her body under the floor of a Glasgow church in 2006. He was also convicted of the 1991 murders of Vicky Hamilton, 15, and Dinah McNicol, 18, who he buried in his garden in Margate, Kent.
