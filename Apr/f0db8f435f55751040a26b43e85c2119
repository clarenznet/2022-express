Madonna, 63, is known for her very provocative snaps and last night was no different. The singer took to Instagram in view of her 17.8 million followers to share a string of pictures as she posed in a studio eating sushi. Madonna shared the raunchy photos while she rocked a black studded leather jacket and fishnet tights. She flaunted her enviable figure as she posed with her legs spread while holding onto her black sunglasses and provocatively covering her crotch with her hand. Madonna accessorised the black outfit with a pair of silver cross earrings, matching necklaces, black winged eyeliner and black leather gloves. Her signature platinum blonde tresses were styled in voluminous curls which fell effortlessly around her face. She made sure her hair did not block her ample assets though, as they were left on full display under her mesh top. The singer showed off her youthful appearance with several close ups of her wrinkle free face as she ate sushi in the sexy snaps. Madonna captioned the post: "Music and Sushi save my life.,,,,,,, @therealmikedean @sickickmusic #frozen." (sic) Many social media users took to the comments to compliment the hitmaker. Dazesplace said: "The most beautiful and talented woman in the world, Queen." Ant_dec added: "Lovely to see your mesmerizing eyes not hidden by dark sunglasses." Whatthefishsay commented: "Love the hair! You donâ€™t need the editing at all, Madonna. You're gorgeous. I promise."
