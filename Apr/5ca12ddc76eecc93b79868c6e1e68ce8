Princess Anne is on a three-day visit to Sydney on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II to mark Her Majesty's Platinum Jubilee. Today, she opened the 200th Sydney Royal Easter Show. The Princess Royal stepped out in a duck-egg blue ensemble to view cattle on the Cattle Judging Lawn. She wore a chic coat which cinched in at the waist. It fastened with three blue buttons in a slightly darker shade. It also had little buttons on the wrists in the same style.

The statement piece of the Princess's ensemble was her wide-brimmed hat, in an identical shade to the dress. The outfit was perfectly colour coordinated; even the hat boasted a minimal teal detail. Her hat also featured spiral detailing which resembled a flower. To accessorise, the Princess Royal opted for suede gloves in navy. She wore a small navy handbag on her shoulder, complete with a silver chain. Anne donned a gold brooch. The dainty accessory featured three small flowers arranged amongst spirals. Like her mother, who has an impressive collection of 98 brooches, Princess Anne is partial to this sophisticated yet intricate accessory. The royal even has a gold brooch in the shape of a horse, which she has owned since the 1980s. A talented Olympic equestrian, this brooch has special significance. She wore it at the Aintree races on April 7. To complement today's choice of brooch, the pretty trio of flowers, Princess Anne selected simplistic gold drop earrings. They had a small diamond shape which dangled off her ears. She paired this with a dainty gold chain choker-style necklace featuring several small diamonds. Ever practical, the Princess went for smart black shoes as she was standing on the grass. Princess Anne fan Gilly Lucas took to Twitter: "The Princess looks very nice too, loving the outfit colour." Royal Neddy said: "Loving the hat."
