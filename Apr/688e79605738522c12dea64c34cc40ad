Rihanna, 34, stunned during her latest night out to the popular restaurant The Nice Guy in West Hollywood. The heavily pregnant singer once again had her growing bump on full display in a head-to-toe pink ensemble on Monday evening. The hitmaker strutted her stuff in a pair of low-rise pink jeans paired with a tiny bralette. She paired the look with some towering bubblegum-coloured stilettos and a brown jacket with fur trim. The Barbadian beauty added some sparkle with a diamond necklace, matching stud earrings and a huge ring on her finger. Rihanna is expecting her first child with rapper A$AP Rocky who she started dating in 2020. Last month, Rihanna opened up about motherhood saying that she thinks she will be “psycho” if anyone upset her children. She told Elle US: “That's the type of mom I'm going to be. Psycho about it... You talk about my kids, it's over.” Last year A$AP Rocky said the Diamonds singer was the “love of his life”. When asked how he feels about being in a relationship, he told GQ: “So much better when you got 'The One.' She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones.”
