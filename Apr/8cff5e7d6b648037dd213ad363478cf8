Sharon joins her close friend Piers Morgan on new channel TalkTV, where the pair will present their own programmes. She said: “Everybody’s scared of saying something wrong that somebody would take and sell. “It’s no way to live. I don’t want it. I don’t need it. It’s just our time to go home. I don’t want to be judged.” The former X Factor judge left CBS show The Talk last year after defending Piers over his criticism of Meghan Markle’s famous Oprah Winfrey interview, which saw him quit Good Morning Britain. He had sparked controversy after insisting he “didn’t believe a word” the Duchess of Sussex said during the explosive talk. Rushing to her friend’s defence, Sharon tweeted at the time: “Piers Morgan, I am with you. I stand by you. People forget that you’re paid for your opinion and that you’re just speaking your truth.” During an episode of The Talk on March 10 last year, Sharon’s co-host Sheryl Underwood accused her of giving “validation” to “racist” views. Sharon replied: “I feel like I’m about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is a racist so that makes me a racist.” The racism row saw Sharon, who is married to rocker Ozzy Osbourne, receive death threats. She said: “They were saying they were going to come in the night, cut my throat, cut Ozzy’s throat, cut my dogs’ throats.” The Talk was taken off air while an investigation was carried out. It was later announced that she was leaving the show. But Sharon begins a new chapter tonight on TalkTV, a UK news channel that is launching today. She is hosting a nightly panel debate show, also called The Talk. The star will appear alongside five panellists on the programme, which airs on weeknights at 9pm.
