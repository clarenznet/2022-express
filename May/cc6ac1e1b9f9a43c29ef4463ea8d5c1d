It comes after it was revealed that convictions for motoring offences in England and Wales rose by more than a fifth last year, according to new figures.   Analysis of Home Office data by the AA, found 565,440 drivers were successfully prosecuted in 2021, up 22 percent from 462,817 a year earlier. This included a 30 percent spike in convictions for causing death by dangerous or careless driving, while those for speeding - the most common reason for a court appearance - rose 24 percent. Successful prosecutions for drug-driving increased by 51 percent year-on-year, with a 13 percent uplift in drink-drive convictions. The overall increase in convictions coincided with a rise in traffic during 2021, after Covid lockdowns caused a sharp fall in journeys during the previous year.    AA Head of Roads Policy Jack Cousens said the figures are a clear and stark warning to drivers that the law will catch them. He added: "Considering police forces are drastically stretched, they are still catching poor drivers in the act. "While the courts continue to catch up with a backlog of Covid cases, drivers should use this as a timely reminder of the huge responsibility they have to themselves and others when driving. "All the focus should be on getting from A to B safely without being under the influence or getting distracted."
