Manchester United transfer target Christopher Nkunku has dropped a huge hint over his future - and has indicated he won't be coming to Old Trafford. The French forward is in demand after an incredible season for RB Leipzig. Nkunku has been in fine form this season, earning the Bundesliga Player of the Year award. The striker has bagged 35 goals in 51 games across all competitions. Despite being under contract until 2024, Nkunku isn't short of potential suitors ahead of the summer transfer window. A host of teams from around Europe have been credited with an interest. United are believed to be among the frontrunners, but Nkunku's latest comments have indicated he is eager to move elsewhere. Speaking to a press conference on Sunday, he suggested he instead wanted to return to his old club Paris Saint-Germain. When asked about his future, Nkunku said: "Paris is my home, my favorite club. I don't close any doors. Everything is possible in football. It's nice to have the biggest clubs in the world interested in me. But it's also great to see that Leipzig are doing everything to keep me." Nkunku came through the academy at PSG and played 55 times for the French side, but departed in 2019 after growing frustrated at his lack of playing time. But it seems the Frenchman is eager to return to the Parc des Princes. Leipzig are desperate to keep Nkunku at the club for another year and are believed to be adamant he won't be going anywhere this summer. United were interested when Ralf Rangknick was at the club, but the former interim manager was apparently left stunned that United chiefs hadn't scouted him. Instead, United are set to prioritise looking for a new central midfielder this summer, with Frankie de Jong said to be the club's top target. The Barcelona playmaker could be sold this summer due to the Catalan side's dire financial situation. United are apparently willing to make De Jong their highest-paid player and offer him a contract worth Â£390,000 per-week.
