The Home Office said thugs convicted of using Class A drugs at football matches will now face a five-year-ban. Nearly half of murder suspects are users. And police will today tell the National Drugs Summit they need to target people who think taking drugs is a "victimless crime". The Prime Minister said: "Middle class cokeheads should stop kidding themselves. Their habit is feeding a war on our streets, driving misery and crime across our country."
