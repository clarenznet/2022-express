The Conveyor sank with the loss of 12 lives, including Captain Ian North. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. 114 years ago (1908) British prospectors led by William Knox D'Arcy made the first major oil discovery in the Middle East, in Persia, now called Iran. The oil rights were secured by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company (APOC) which then became the British Petroleum Company in 1954. 55 years ago (1967) The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the band's eighth studio album and their first release since the Fab Four had announced their retirement from touring in August 1966. Ranked by Rolling Stone magazine as the greatest album of all time, the record has since gone on to sell more than 32 million copies around the world.
