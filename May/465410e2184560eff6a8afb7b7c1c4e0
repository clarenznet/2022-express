While this seems like a colossal amount of food to non-strongmen champions, Brian made a surprising revelation: "I wake up starving - I'm pretty much starving all day to be fair." In the video, he polished the meat, eggs and rice with a cup of blueberries. For a "treat", Brian would enjoy two rice cakes. A further 10 ounces of bison was his next meal. Next, the strongman would drink a protein shake, complete with probiotics, digestive enzymes and 65g of protein. The average recommended amount for a male is 55g per day - and Brian got this in just one shake. With the protein shake, he'd enjoy a banana with peanut butter, plus two rice crispy treats on training days. His next meal was 12 ounces of shredded chicken, four ounces of asparagus and a bag of sweet potato fries. "I need carbs. I'm not going to cut out carbs completely because that would be ridiculous." Next is 10 ounces of bison meat, one and a half cups of rice and a bowl of salad, finished with a balsamic intake. The strongman used to eat between 9,000-10,000 calories per day - sometimes even more - so he described this current meal plan as a "significant drop". He also used a fat burning drink. He admitted to using progress photographs to track his transformation as opposed to incessant weigh-ins, as these put him in a "bad mental spot". But, he revealed he was "excited" about his journey. He offered a piece of advice to fellow slimmers: "If you're going through your own transformation, keep it up, just do it on a daily basis. "Stay motivated, stay hungry, stay excited."
