The election of Labor's Anthony Albanese as the new Prime Minister in Australia had raised questions about whether a new UK trade deal signed with Scott Morrison's Liberal Government would go ahead. But a senior source at the Department for International Trade said "the deal is done" and will not be cancelled. The source said: "The deal is done. In principle agreement last summer and the deal signed this winter. What is happening now is legislation to bring it into affect. Doesnâ€™t appear to be any worries from [International Trade secretary] Anne-Marie Trevelyan."  The Australian Labor party will topple the ruling conservatives at a national election although it may have to form a minority government, the Australian Broadcasting Corp said.  Initial vote counts showed Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative coalition and the Labor opposition under Anthony Albanese losing ground to smaller parties like the environment-focused Greens and climate-focussed independents. Neither of the major parties appeared certain to win the minimum 76 seats required for a majority in the 151-seat parliament, but Labor appeared on track to win more than 70 seats, the ABC said. "Labor is 72 and needs 76 seats to govern. There are 11 members of the crossbench, most of whom support action on climate change," said ABC election analyst Antony Green in a live broadcast. "If Labor falls short and it wants to form government, it can talk to the Greens or it can talk to the crossbench." Cable television station Sky News ran a chyron which said: "Labor tracking towards election victory".
