The UK is currently seeing an unprecedented rise in cases of monkeypox - a rare disease that is caused by infection with monkeypox virus. The leading hypothesis is that the viral infection was imported from Western Africa, although this is still being actively investigated. So far, 20 cases of monkeypox have been detected in the UK. The president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) predicts this number will jump in the coming weeks. Speaking to Sky News, Doctor Dewsnap said: "There is going to be more diagnoses over the next week. How many is hard to say.

David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist at the World Health Organisation, said he believed the viral infection had entered the population as a "sexual form". "What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world," he said. The CDC says: "In humans, the symptoms of monkeypox are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox."
