Demi Rose Mawby has taken to Instagram to put on an eye-popping display in a pearl and chain adorned top. The star, 27, dazzled in the barely-there top which was draped strategically over her voluptuous figure.  In view of her 19.7 million followers, Demi shared a series of sultry snaps on the sun-drenched island of Ibiza while simply captioning them, "Divine". The Birmingham native posed expertly for the pics while wearing very little. Demi donned a beautiful Pearl and chain bra which only just covered her ample assests. It fell seductively down her petite frame and hugged her incredible curves. On her lower half, the model wore a silky, cream-coloured sarong which had been tied in a knot at the front. The star put her perfectly toned figure on display as she posed on the sunny island. Demi wore a full face of natural-looking makeup, including a soft pink lip, a hint of blush and perfectly lined eyes. Her long, highlighted-brown tressed fell over one shoulder as she stood with her hands on her hips. In the third snap, the star coud be seen leaning against a tree as she gazed wistfully into the distance.
