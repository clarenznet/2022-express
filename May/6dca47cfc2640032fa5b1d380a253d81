The UK could face a wet start to next week just days before Brits welcome a “special extended bank holiday weekend” to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Britons will be able to mark the 96-year-old monarch's 70-years on the throne between Thursday and Sunday, including village fetes and 'Big Lunches'. However, the Met Office's forecast for Sunday to Tuesday has suggested Brits hoping to celebrate Her Majesty's milestone could see “cloud and showers” just days before. The forecast said: “Cold start for many west and southwestern areas, Sunday. “Cloud and showers, already affecting the northeast, will spread to all areas, lasting through Monday and Tuesday. Rather cool, or cool.” The UK's national weather service has also released its forecast for Friday and Saturday.

Temperatures in the early hours of Monday morning are also expected to be near freezing, with mercury hovering anywhere from 2C in places. However, as the day progresses, temperatures look set to exceed double-digits in much of England and Wales. Temperatures will also be near 10C in Scotland.
