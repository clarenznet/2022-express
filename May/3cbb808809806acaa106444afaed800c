They will pay around £2,000 more than they would have two years ago as values have surged and tax breaks against the duty have not risen since 2014, reveals property portal Zoopla. Average house prices, since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, have jumped £29,000 to stand at £249,700 after a race for space and demand was propped up by the stamp duty holiday. This ended last year, so with the normal rates back in force, the surge in property values means many homes have entered a new tax band. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "The stamp duty holiday had a nasty sting in the tail. Hundreds of thousands actually paid more tax, thanks to the huge hike in house prices. "While an estimated one million people paid less tax, as soon as the window closed other buyers started to pay the price. "The higher tax bills are piling more pressure on buyers, who are already facing rampant house price rises, hikes in mortgage rates and runaway bills, making it increasingly difficult to cover the cost of the mortgage." Yet Ms Coles said all these pressures have done little to dent the enthusiasm for property - with demand for homes at 58 percent above the five-year average. She added: "With property running so hot, buyers may feel they cannot afford to take their foot off the accelerator for fear of being left behind by the market. "But there will come a time when the pressure on buyers takes a toll. It could mean enthusiasm for property starts to cool, as the cost of living reaches a tipping point." A typical house worth £278,123 would mean £3,906 in stamp duty - with the levy for the Treasury forecast to top £17billion for the first time in the year to March 2023. First-time buyers are now spending an average of £225,000 up £27,000 on two years ago.  In England and Northern Ireland, no stamp duty is due on the first £125,000 of a property bought as a main residence - though that threshold is £300,000 for first time buyers. For properties between £125,001 and £250,000 the levy is two percent while for those on sale between £250,001 and £925,000 it is five percent. Meanwhile, interest rates could rise to a 13-year high tomorrow as the Bank of England battles high inflation. The Bank's policymakers are predicted to increase rates from 0.75 percent to one percent - a level not seen since early 2009. If the base bank rate is passed on to mortgage payers, two million of them could face an average rise of £1,000 a year in higher payments. An increase to one percent would lift mortgage payments by £99 per month on a 75 percent loan-to-value mortgage on the average UK property costing £270,708. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee have already raised rates at each of its past three meetings to try to rein in inflation, which hit a 30-year high of seven percent in March.
