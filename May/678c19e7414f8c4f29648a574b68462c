Boom Boom is portrayed by actor Sharif Atkins who has been in just three episodes of NCIS Hawaii season one. Despite his infrequent appearances, fans have enjoyed watching the bomb expert continue to pop up in the police procedural. Atkins isn't in every episode like the main cast as he is slated as just a recurring character which Captain Joe star Gjokaj also is. So there is no guarantee that actor Atkins will be back for more when the drama returns.  CBS renewed NCIS Hawaii for a second outing earlier this year, prior to the drama coming to an end. The green light for more episodes was not only given to the latest spin-off but to the original NCIS for its 20th season and NCIS Los Angeles for series 14. A release date for NCIS Hawaii season two has not yet been confirmed. NCIS Hawaii is available to watch on CBS in America.
