The Duke of Sussex joined 5Rights Foundation as it launched the Global Child Online Safety Toolkit webinar, where he spoke from his and Duchess Meghan's Montecito home about the dangers that the digital world poses to children. Speaking for the first time about his opinion on social media, he said: "I'm not an expert on law or technology, but I am a fatherâ€”and I'm lucky enough to be a father with a platform. My kids are too young to have experienced the online world yet, and I hope they never have to experience it as it exists now. No kid should have to." He continued: "It is not realistic to protect kids from everything. We need new laws. We need public pressure. We need strong leadership." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
