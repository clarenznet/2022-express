  Danni, 33, shared the pair of sizzling snaps this afternoon, which were liked by her co-star Scarlette Douglas. “Go fast or go home,” she captioned the sun-soaked images, adding a series of hashtags revealing her to be in Mykonos, Greece. The pictures showed Danni posing atop a white quad bike on a dirt road with a view of the ocean behind her. She showed off her deep tan and some impressive abs in a skimpy white crop top.  The star matched the top with some high-rise, frayed denim shorts that displayed her long legs. Danni paired the outfit with some stunning white, high heeled boots. She accessorised with some white-rimmed shades and wore her blonde looks in a casual down-do. The star looked ecstatic as she made a peace sign for the camera and smiled.
