Jane Fonda, 84, debuted her drastic new hair colour while out and about on set in Rome, Italy. The Hollywood icon looked beyond youthful as she debuted her chestnut hair, featuring platinum silver streaks. The actress looked very stylish in a floral yellow blazer and smart black trousers. She styled the outfit with a gold necklace, pump shoes and a black and gold clutch bag. Jane was filming in Villa Borghese Park in Rome for Book Club 2. Book Club is a 2018 American comedy directed by Bill Holderman, starring Diane Keaton, Jane, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen.
