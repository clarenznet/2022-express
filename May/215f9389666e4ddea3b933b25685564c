Antonio Conte has struck back at Jurgen Klopp for making 'excuses' after the Liverpool boss criticised Tottenham's game plan in a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday. The result made a huge dent in the Reds' Premier League title prospects, and Conte suggested that the emotion may have got the better of his managerial rival after a tense encounter. Klopp hit out at Spurs for 'sitting back' on Saturday, despite fielding a team full of 'world-class players'. Nevertheless, the game plan earned Conte and co a crucial point in their quest for fourth place. Having soaked up waves of pressure, Ryan Sessegnon set up Heung-min Son to tap home and stun the home crowd. Luis Diaz's deflected strike ensured that the game finished 1-1, but Manchester City's emphatic victory over Newcastle on Sunday opened up a three-point gap at the top of the table. Conte issued his own response to Klopp's emotional rant on Tuesday, saying: "Honestly, for the coach it is not simple after the game, you have to try to keep your head cool. Sometimes it is not easy and many times if you remember this season I was disappointed with the result and myself and my players.

It is important to be focused on your team. "He was a bit frustrated after the game but at the same time for every coach it is important to be focused on your team, not the opponent. It means you want to find an excuse or an alibi because your job was wrong."
