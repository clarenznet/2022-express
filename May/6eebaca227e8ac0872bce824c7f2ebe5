After being hit with financial cutbacks, Netflix has cancelled Archewell Productions' "Pearl", an animated children's series following the adventures of a young girl who found inspiration in influential women throughout history. Royal biographer and expert Robert Jobson told the Mirror the streaming giant would expect "more bang" for their £71million deal with the Sussexes. He said: "The couple may now face increasing pressure to come up with the goods, royal related goods too, to bring back Netflix’s subscribers... But the cancelling of Meghan’s series proves one thing - their name and royal associations alone, doesn’t guarantee backing in the ruthless world of showbiz. Will Netflix demand more royal tittle tattle, from the prince and his wife? Are they prepared to sell-out even more? Only time will tell." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
