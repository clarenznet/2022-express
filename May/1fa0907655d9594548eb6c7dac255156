  Ncuti was positively beaming on the red carpet today following the news that he will be the next actor to take on the role of the Doctor in BBC’s Doctor Who. The actor was previously best known for playing Eric in Netflix’s hit show Sex Education, but it seems that even bigger things are on the star’s horizon. Ncuti looked confident as he posed ahead of the awards show tonight, sporting a new blonde hairdo. He wore a black, long-sleeved top with a large cut-out around his chest, leaving the area bare to highlight his impressive abs.  The star wore black trousers with streams of matching material surrounding his legs, and finished the look with a pair of black sandals. The Virgin Media BAFTA TV Awards recognises the television highlights viewers enjoyed in 2021, with hit, critically acclaimed shows including It’s A Sin, We Are Lady Parts, Landscapers, Help and Time leading the nominations. The star-studded ceremony is being held at the Royal Festival Hall in London today. The ceremony will air for fans tonight from 6pm on BBC One.
