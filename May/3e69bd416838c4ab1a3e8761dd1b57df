Following the serious crash at Mottram Moor late last night, the A57 remains shut in both directions. Greater Manchester Police are at the scene.  They are conducting an investigation into what caused the incident. National Highways said a serious collision investigation will be required due to the nature of the accident. The road is currently closed to traffic between the BB6174 and the A628 near Mottram in Longdendale. Traffic monitoring service Inrix reports: "The road is likely to remain closed well into the morning." Congestion is building in alternative routes as people are encouraged to avoid the area. Inrix report: "Congestion to Tintwistle. Also seeing delays through Broadbottom and Charlesworth as traffic diverts." Transport for Greater Manchester later added: "Heavy congestion is now being experienced on surrounding routes around Gamesley Broadbottom & Charlesworth. "Please consider postponing or delaying your journey if possible." Bus routes are also being affected by the diversion of travel. Stagecoach has confirmed that their 237 service will not be able to attend Glossop as a result. However, their 817 school bus service is still in operation. Just over a week ago a car was half-destroyed when it crashed into a lorry on the A27. The collision occurred westbound between Devil’s Dyke Road and Hangleton, causing long delays. Images taken at the scene show the car being removed from the road with the entire front of the vehicle destroyed.
