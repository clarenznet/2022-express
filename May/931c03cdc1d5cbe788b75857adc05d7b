Category judge Natalie Kenway, the editor of ESG Clarity, said: “What stood out for me about Steph’s work was the fact that there were two sides of the coin; that sometimes climate change can feel quite distant for some people. It doesn’t quite feel like part of our everyday lives. “Talking about air pollution and asthma in our children, quite literally brings [the issue] into our homes. I think people find that a lot more relatable. “But on the other side of the coin, it was really interesting and quite saddening to read about the Kenyan tribes and the impact of droughts on their cattle. That really did have a lasting impact on me. I was thinking about that for days after.” Steph has travelled to Sri Lanka to highlight how pollution is choking the country, and recently returned from Kenya where she covered how the Maasai tribe’s livelihood is threatened by climate change. Keith Gladdis, a senior director of media at MHP Mischief, said: “This year’s awards have been bigger than ever. We’ve had a record 450 entries from journalists across Britain and around the world. “But it’s not just the number of entries that makes the eleventh 30 To Watch Awards so exciting, it’s the quality.”
