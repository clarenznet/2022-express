Holly Willoughby, 41, left fans stunned as she jumped in the pool fully clothed after hosting ITV's The Games on Tuesday night. The presenter was joined by her co-star Andrew "Freddie" Flintoff, 44, who held her hand as they both jumped in. Despite the pair’s antics, Holly managed to look effortlessly chic in a shorts and blazer co-ord in a boomerang shared in view of her 7.7 million Instagram followers. She captioned the post: “And that’s a wrap on tonight’s episode of @thegamestv … always a pleasure @aflintoff11” Her followers appeared amused by the ITV stars' fun display, with some rushing to the post’s comments section. Grannydenise56 said: “Perfect end to a perfect evening.” Dave_octave_sings added: “Loved this moment so much! I was screaming from the sideline!” Geoffers008 simply commented: “Absolutely love this.”
