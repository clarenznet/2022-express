A Place In The Sun presenter Danni Menzies has been soaking up the sun on a recent getaway to Mykonos, Greece. The blonde beauty sent temperatures soaring after she took to Instagram and shared a cheeky photo today. The 33-year-old showed off her incredible physique as she posed on a boat in a blue two-piece bikini. The Channel 4 favourite enjoyed fun in the sun as she enjoyed her break from work. In one photo, Danni could be seen flaunting her taut abs as she stood on the ladder of the boat which led out to sea while sporting a pair of sunglasses. Her blonde tresses were soaked from the seawater as she looked out into the distance. In a second snap, the property expert beamed directly at the camera as she flashed her bottom. In view of her 99,000 followers, she captioned the post with a simple heart emoji. The presenter added the hashtags: "#mykonos #greekislands #lovetravel #alwaystraveling #healthylifestyle #boatlife #atsea #greece."
