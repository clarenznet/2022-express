Fulham prodigy Fabio Carvalho surprisingly chose Manchester United as his go-to team on FIFA in a video with Bleacher Report - despite a move to Liverpool for the Portuguese youngster being imminent.  Carvalho, 19, has impressed heavily for the Cottagers since bursting onto the scene in the first team in 2020. Having moved to England when he was 11, the star immediately joined Fulham's youth academy and has made 40 league appearances since, scoring 11 goals. That has piqued the interest of the quadruple-chasing Reds, with a deal imminent according to various reports. But after playing FIFA with Bleacher Report's Jake Barford, the Lisbon-born star has surprised fans by opting to use United instead. "I'm gonna go with United, I need some five-star skillers," Carvalho admitted. The midfielder may initially find it difficult to break into Liverpool's star-studded midfield given the excellence of Thiago, Fabinho and Jordan Henderson to name but a few. But having already had Premier League experience, he may be more of an asset than people realise. And he touched upon his experiences in the Premier League when he played against the world's best in his time at Fulham. "Just playing against all the players, like [Kevin] de Bruyne and that, it was just crazy seeing everyone in real life," Carvalho continued. "But I told myself before the game, like, just go out and try and get on the ball as much as possible. "Like I told you, I played against United and that was one of my first games for Fulham. And I was just starstruck, but I told myself 'this game, just go out and show the world what you can do'.  "It was just good to be a part of the experience as a whole." Fulham are expected to battle against relegation next season after they won the Championship. And Carvalho could come back to haunt them if he starts for the Reds next season.
