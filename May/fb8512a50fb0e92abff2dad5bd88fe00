Queen Elizabeth II, 96, has been experiencing mobility problems that have kept her from attending high-profile events over the past few months. For the upcoming Jubilee celebrations, the Queen is likely to have a limited role at the planned events. Royal aides have said she is now experiencing “good and less good days” and is “aware of her frailties”. As a result, two contingency plans have been drafted depending on how she will be feeling during the Trooping the Colour parade. The first plan will see her travelling by carriage to inspect the troops and then reappearing on the balcony with other working royals. The second option reportedly being considered would see the Queen only appear on the balcony, skipping the parade altogether. Claims have been made that this appearance of the Queen alongside her family might be the last chance for royal fans to praise her. Writer and royal biographer, Hugo Vickers, said this year’s Jubilee will be particularly special for the nation. He said: “The British will be all the more excited because this Jubilee will probably be the last major public occasion to thank the Queen.” The expert, who has met the Queen on multiple occasions, noted that no monarch will be able to surpass her majesty. Expressing his admiration for the Queen, he said: “We will never see anything like it again, even if we were to live a thousand years.” And he went on to explain that it will all be different when she is gone, since she is difficult to be replaced: “She is unique in the world, unshakeable! “A great queen, who has instilled an atmosphere of calm and confidence in her kingdom and the Commonwealth. “She has presided over decades of change with equal dignity, never making mistakes.” Asked about whether her heir, Prince Charles, has taken her place by taking on some of the monarch’s responsibilities, Mr Vickers said that this is not the case.
