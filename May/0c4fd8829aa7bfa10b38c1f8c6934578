Connelly, 40, will be out in weeks after the board rejected Dominic Raab's arguments to keep her locked up. He said her cruelty towards her son was "pure evil". Baby P suffered more than 50 injuries at the hands of Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. The case sparked revulsion and outrage after it emerged the tot - whose name was Peter - had received 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals in Tottenham, north London, before his death in 2007. Mr Raab said: "The decision to release her demonstrates why the Parole Board needs a fundamental overhaul - including a ministerial check for the most serious offenders - so that it protects the public." Connelly was jailed in 2009 over the death of her 17-month-old son, along with Barker and Owen. She admitted causing or allowing the death of a child. Barker remains locked up while Owen was freed in 2011 then recalled in 2013. Connelly left jail the same year but was back two years later after selling porn of herself. Mr Raab argued allowing her to be released now was irrational. But the Parole Board said a judge upheld its decision, finding it was based on all the evidence and "was not irrational". When released, Connelly must wear a tag, keep a curfew and disclose any relationships. Her internet use and location are also subject to rules.
