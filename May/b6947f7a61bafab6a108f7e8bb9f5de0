BA has been struggling with staff shortages over the last few weeks. This has led to mass cancellations.

This could even be with a rival airline. British Airways said all passengers were given advance notice. If the cancellation was announced less than two weeks in advance, passengers should receive compensation if the airline was responsible. easyJet has also cancelled flights from Gatwick but said most passengers were able to switch onto new flights. The budget carrier is set to cut a row of seating from its flights so it can reduce the number of passengers to 150. This would allow the airline to deploy fewer members of crew on flights in a move it hopes will reduce cancellations. Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO of Advantage Travel Partnership, told Express.co.uk: “easyJet resorting to stripping out seats prevents them from having to cancel flights and keeps their capacity for this summer close to 2019 levels avoiding unnecessary flight cancellations helping consumers and travel agents manage demand for overseas travel.” Staff shortages have hit a huge range of businesses in the aviation industry with airports also affected. Passengers at Birmingham and Manchester airports faced chaotic scenes yesterday as they tried to get away. Tourists had to queue outside the airport due to lengthy security waits. Security staff can take a while to recruit due to the high level of safety clearance needed. Julia told Express.co.uk she thinks staff shortages are “likely to continue for a while” although the industry is working to address matters.
