You can add your voice to the tens of thousands of comments posted daily on Express.co.uk and have your say on the big issues facing the country today. In England, more than 4,000 councillors in 146 councils will be standing for election in major cities including Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs. The Scots and the Welsh will also head to the polling booth to elect every local authority, and across the Irish Sea, those in Northern Ireland will vote for all 90 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Local elections don’t enjoy the same prominence as a general election but they still decide who is responsible for local services in your area. Everything from planning issues, rubbish collection, potholes and public transport is controlled by your local council, and Thursday is the day you get to decide who should be in charge. But do local elections matter to you? Are you voting for your local services or to have your say on Boris Johnson’s Government?
