The M1 northbound has been closed in Leicestershire due to a smash-up involving multiple vehicles, just next to East Midlands Airport. It is closed from J23A (leading to the airport) to J24, with a diversion in place - although traffic is reportedly taking a long time to clear. Emergency services are at the scene. National Highways' Traffic Officers are also present to help with traffic management. One frustrated driver said of the traffic: "Absolutely ridiculous how long it’s taking to clear!" The AA said the motorway was closed due to a "rolled over vehicle". As well as creating problems for East Midlands Airport, the closure could prove disastrous for football fans travelling north to see Luton Town play Huddersfield tonight at 7.45pm. They will playing at the John Smith's Stadium in Huddersfield. Luton Town F.C. tweeted warning fans of the closure and reminding them to "travel safely" following the collision. One eager fan responded demanding: "DELAY KICK OFF!" Another tweeted from the pile-up of traffic: "Going to be a real stretch to make kick off and probably majority of Luton fans stuck behind us." Travellers are advised to follow the Solid Square diversion symbol on road signs. The diversion path advises drivers to exit the M1 at J23A, and take the slip road onto the A42 free flow lane to the A42/A453 Finger Farm Roundabout.Drivers should then take the third exit onto the A453 southbound and continue along the A453 southbound to the M1 J24 interchange. They should then take the second exit onto the M1 Northbound.
