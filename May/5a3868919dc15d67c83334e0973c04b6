Joe Biden has been blasted for overseeing "amateur hour" at the White House after the US President was forced to walk back on a previous statement which appeared to talk up the United States's willingness to use force to defend Taiwan from China. Mr Biden's mishandling of the US policy on Taiwan has been blasted by Asia expert Gordon Chang who argues the gaffe could have grave consequences for US "defence commitments around the world." Mr Chang told Fox News: "This is amateur hour at 1600, Pennsylvania. Mr BidenÂ stressed during the trip, intended in part to counter China's growing influence in the region, that the United States will stand with its allies and partners to push for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
