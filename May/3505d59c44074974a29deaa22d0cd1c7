Qantas Airways has ordered new jets in a deal with Airbus which will allow them to make the non-stop trip between the UK and Australia. This trip is set to take 20 hours. This is four hours quicker than the current travelling time with many airlines. Qantas Airways has announced it has ordered 12 special Airbus jets to make this possible. The airline has not stated how much the flights will cost. However, they are likely to be impacted by high fuel costs and limited seating on the aircrafts.

This is what has happened on similar long haul flights, such as those between Perth and London. Plans show this will launch in late 2025, meaning trips could be possible in just a few years. A250-1000 aircrafts will be used and they will include extra premium seating.  Capacity will also be reduced with up to 238 seats available on each flight. This is around 100 fewer seats than British Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd use for similar routes. Those taking the trip with Qantas will be able to choose from four classes. More than 40 percent of seating will be dedicated to premium classes. Currently, travelling from London to Sydney takes up to 24 hours. This is because aircrafts need to stop to refuel for the lengthy journey. When the new aircraft is launched, it will become the longest direct commercial flight. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce spoke today of growing demand for flights as Covid restrictions relax. Many people have been cautious when travelling in the last two years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Travel rules have continually changed at short notice. This has led to holidaymakers being stranded abroad or not able to reach their destination. However, many countries have been relaxing restrictions in recent months. Those heading abroad are urged to check entry requirements before travelling.
