The supermarket giant launched the £8 twin dresses ahead of the four-day bank holiday celebration of the monarch's 70-year reign. Many shoppers were quick to fall in love with the George at Asda dresses featuring a floral Union Jack print. They come in midi length for adults as well as children aged 12 months to 14 years, reports Manchester Evening News. One Instagram user posted two heart eye emojis and said “how cuteee”, while another added: "Ooh I love me some matching Mummy and daughter outfits!!" But the range has sold out in "record time" cauisng some shoppers to take to social media in frustration. The supermarket's fashion label posted a picture of the dresses to its 727k followers this week and said: "Twin in dresses fit for Queens. Prices from £8!" But shoppers said they had not been able to buy the clothes in time. Sarah_b104 said: "I missed this! Gutted". Clarke.nicky added: "Pointless out of stock."  And hayley.worthington said: "Every single size out of stock. So this is a pointless post isn’t it!" Responding in the comments, George at Asda said: "Sorry folks, you loved the dress so much it sold out in record time!! "The team are working hard to get more sizes available online. It may be worth checking in your local ASDA store." Pubs and shops are in line for a £1 billion boost from the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The country’s 45,000 boozers are expected to serve 90 million pints during the four-day knees-up after getting the go-ahead to open until 1am from June 2 to 4. Millions will also head to shops and pubs and shell out for beer, champagne, barbecue food and decorations. The bonanza will give the retail and hospitality sectors a welcome boost after two years of lockdown misery. Co-op has said it is expecting to sell 30,000 bottles of champagne – three times its normal amount for a bank holiday weekend – and 300,000 ice lollies.
