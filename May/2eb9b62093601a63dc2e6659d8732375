Flt Lt Jon Egging, right, died as his Hawk T1 plane crashed at Bournemouth Air Festival in 2011. Dr Emma Egging flew over Northamptonshire in a two-seat Spitfire and told ITV: "Jon would be so jealous because it would have been his dream to get in a Spitfire. "For me to be doing this, of course he'd be proud, but pretty jealous." Jon, 33, from Rutland, had been performing with the RAF aerobatic team when he blacked out due to the effects of G-force and crashed. Emma later paid tribute to him as "a hero in anybody's book". The flight in a Spitfire was the last of her 10 challenges to mark a decade since she founded the Jon Egging Trust. The charity, supported by TV scientist Brian Cox, provides support through STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) education for vulnerable youngsters. Emma also completed an ultra-marathon and hiked 20 miles across the Peak District to raise funds.
