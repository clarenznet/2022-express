Jim Chuter, 33, carried out the burglaries at the height of lockdown when the victims were entirely alone and unable to see friends or family. He was, though, jailed last week for 10 years after pleading guilty to 26 charges, including nine for burglary, sixteen counts of fraud and a robbery. A court heard Chuter targeted one 90-year-old man for several months, stealing his entire life savings of £25,000. His "campaign of dishonesty" happened across west London boroughs, including Hillingdon, Hounslow and Ealing, and parts of Surrey, between September 2019 and July 2020. Guildford Crown Court heard Chuter was arrested in August that year and was recalled to prison, having been recently released on licence for similar offences. Once Chuter had been inside their homes, he would continue to hound the victims, phoning and intimidating them into paying more money for work that had never been done, reports My London. Investigating for Metropolitan Police, detective constable Hannah Woodford said: "Chuter is a career criminal whose cowardly offences were committed against vulnerable and frail people at a time when they were already living with the worries and loneliness of pandemic life. "As police, we understand that the effects of being a victim of crime go far beyond a loss of property and my thoughts are with Chuter’s many victims and their families. "I hope that the considerable sentence handed down brings them some comfort and a sense of justice."
