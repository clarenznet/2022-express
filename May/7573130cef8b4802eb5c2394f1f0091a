The Greek musician won an Oscar for the 1981 British film's stirring score and also wrote memorable music for Blade Runner, The Bounty and Missing. But it was the lush synthesiser sound of Chariots of Fire that shot Vangelis to fame, famously accompanying an iconic opening shot of athletes running along St Andrews beach in Scotland. The movie was set before the 1924 Olympics and covered the true stories of sprinters Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams. Vangelis once said the theme, which topped both the UK and US charts, was in part a tribute to his father who had been a keen amateur runner. But he was slightly dismissive of its popularity, saying: "It's only another piece of music." He enjoyed unexpected further success with it in 2012 when it shot to the top of the UK classical singles chart after being performed by Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.  As a child Vangelis, who was born Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou in 1943, would experiment with sounds produced by banging pots and pans or fixing nails, glasses and other objects to the strings of his parents' piano. He had no formal musical training but left for Paris at the age of 25 in an exodus of young artists in the wake of a military coup in Greece. He was then drawn by the cutting-edge field of electronic synthesisers which allowed him to create the melodic sounds that would become his trademark. He also had a big hit with Yes lead singer Jon Anderson with I'll Find My Way Home, in 1982.  Vangelis Papathanassiou, born March 29, 1943 - died May 17, 2022, aged 79.
