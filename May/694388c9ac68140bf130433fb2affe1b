The Radio 4 Today programme hust sparked fury yesterday when he got his facts wrong as he questioned Steve Barclay, Boris Johnson's chief of staff. Probing him about the findings of civil servant Sue Gray's "Partygate" report, Mr Robinson said: "One government cleaner, instructed to keep coming into work during lockdown, contracted Covid and died. His name was Emanuel Gomes. "What do you think his family, what do you think his friends, will be thinking today when you say to them the Prime Minister didn't know booze was being brought in industrial quantities so that people could relax after work?" Mr Barclay replied: "I think all our hearts will go out to his family. "As a constituency MP I've heard many absolutely distressing stories from my constituents, who weren't able to attend funerals, who lost loved ones...it was an incredibly fraught time." But in fact Mr Gomes, who died in April 2020, did not work at Downing Street. He was an outsourced cleaner at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). And coronavirus was not given a cause on his death certificate. The interview has outraged critics of the BBC. Rebecca Ryan, of the Defund The BBC campaign, claimed it was emblematic of an anti- Government agenda within the corporation. She said: "Are there no depths to which the BBC will not sink in order to try to unseat an elected Prime Minister? "The broadcaster is obliged by its charter to deliver unbiased journalistic excellence. "Instead, licence fee payers are being forced...to fund a campaign organisation which has a monopas oly over the UK news cycle. There is no balance at the BBC and seemingly no shame."
