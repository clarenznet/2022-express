There will be nearly £10 million in prize money available at the second major golf championship of 2022 this week, the US PGA. The 104th edition of the tournament will be held at the Southern Hills Country Club in Oklahoma, with world No 1 Scottie Scheffler and the man he displaced, Jon Rahm, among the big favourites.  American star Scheffler is aiming for back-to-back major titles after his comprehensive win at the US Masters in April. His victory, which signified his first major success, earned him a cool £2.16 million and more importantly, cemented his status as a future star of the sport. Undoubtedly though, Tiger Woods will again prove one of the star attractions. The 15-time major winner made a miraculous return to action in Augusta, and despite fading after an opening round 71, defied doubters over his physical condition by completing all 72 holes. He won't now be joined in Oklahoma this week by Phil Mickleson, who was set to return from an indefinite break having courted controversy with his comments on the proposed Saudi-backed breakaway tour. The legendary left-hander withdrew last week despite being defending champion, after his surprise 2021 win at Kiawah Island.

Winning the PGA also means automatic inclusion into the other three majors and The Players Championship for the next five years. Second place means just short of £104,000, and third £654,000. There is then quite a sizeable gap to fourth place, which is worth just over £461,000, with the fifth place finisher taking home £385,000.

The reward for creeping inside the top 10 is just over £238,000. The financial implications of finishing way back in 70th place mean a paltry prize of just £15,700 - barely enough to cover the flights of an overseas golfer. Regardless of the outcome, Woods will leave Southern Hills still way ahead on the all-time money list, having made just short of £100 million.
