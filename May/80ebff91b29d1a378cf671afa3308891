The Xbox Series X is widely available to buy right now, with a number of major retailers in the UK listing the Microsoft console as in stock this week. Big name stores such as Amazon UK, GAME, Argos and Currys all have the Xbox Series X as in stock and available to buy, with standalone consoles ready to be purchased as well as bundles. The stock situation in the UK is arguably the best it's been since the Xbox Series X first launched back in November 2020 with the console widely and readily available to purchase. For the time being, gone are the days of having to get into a lengthy queue to purchase an Xbox Series X or worry about stock getting snapped up in a matter of minutes. You can easily pick up the next-gen console from the store of your choice at the moment. Among the best deals available right now can be found at Currys who are selling the Xbox Series X console on its own. But what's great about Currys right now is you can use the FNDDGAMING voucher code to get over one percent off the price.  This code brings the Xbox Series X down from £449 to £444. That's the cheapest the Xbox Series X has been on its own since launch. Currys also offers free delivery or, if you'd rather get your console sooner, you can pay to get it delivered during a specific time slot. You can find some of the best Xbox Series X deals below...
