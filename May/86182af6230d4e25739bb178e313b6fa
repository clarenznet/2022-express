According to the air hostess - named Jet - you should never order a Diet Coke if you're flying abroad. Writing in her blog online, she explained that asking for this drink, as well as other fizzy beverages, whilst in the air can be a bad idea for one simple reason - the bubbles. "Soft drinks foam up a lot more when poured out of a can, and the worst culprit for this is Diet Coke – I literally have to sit and wait for the bubbles to fall before I can continue pouring," Jet explained. "If all three passengers ask for Diet Coke I'll often get them started, take another three drink orders, serve those, and then finish the Diet Cokes." Many of us would think that ordering hot drinks would likely be more inconvenient for in-flight crew, what with turbulence and scolding water, but this isn't the case, the Manchester Evening News reports. In a video demonstrating how Diet Coke can be difficult to pour, the cabin crew said: "What you can't see is that the Diet Coke doesn't come out of the can when flipped upside down until you lift it up and tilt it slightly. This is because the air pressure is keeping the Coke in the can. It makes pouring the Diet Coke very controllable and reduces the chances of spilling or overflow."  The air on a plane is much drier than what it is on the ground, meaning consuming fizzy drinks as well as alcohol can leave you feeling unwell. These are both drinks that can cause passengers problems before and during a plane journey because the risk of dehydration is huge. Also, carbonated drinks can cause gas and heartburn, both of which are unpleasant feelings to have during a flight. The altitude of the plane can also make the situation worse and leave you feeling poorly until you reach your destination. So, next time you fly, it may be worth ordering something else for your sake as well as the cabin crew's.
