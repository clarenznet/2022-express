There was initially no information on the fate of those onboard after the plane went off the radar for unknown reasons. These have all now been found dead. Damir Trut, General Director at the National Protection and Rescue Directorate, said on day after the plane went missing: “Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that all passengers who were on board the Cessna aircraft were killed.” He added that the search had been delayed due to bad weather. Search teams also used drones to help with their efforts. The plane crashed in a mountainous area. Its wreckage was found in the hamlet of Brocanac. This is just over 60 miles south of Zagreb, Croatia’s capital. READ MORE: Rejected Russian student university row raises 'more questions' The passengers are reported to have been his acquaintances.
