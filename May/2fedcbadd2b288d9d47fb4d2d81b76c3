Joan Collins, 88, looked phenomenal as she attended talent management company InterTalent's 30th birthday party. The ageless actress put on a cosy display with her husband, Percy Gibson, 57, as they made their way to the bash. The loved up couple, who were photographed holding hands, have been married for 20 years. For the event, Joan wore a black midi dress with an asymmetric neckline with lace inserts. She completed the look with shiny silver stilettos and jewellery, while wearing her staple chestnut hair in voluminous curls. Percy looked dapper in a grey suit complete with a silver tie and pink shirt.
