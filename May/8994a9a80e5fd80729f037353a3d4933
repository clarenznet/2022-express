Gareth Leach, 28, and Kyle Martin, 22, pounced on Dean Williamson, dashing his head against a wall and stamping upon him. A court heard Mr Williamson, 45, had stolen a mobility scooter, which belonged to the thugs' mum Sara Martin, in the days before the beating. Ms Martin, who lived next door to Mr Williamson, had taken the scooter back and informed her sons. They battered the victim, who had lung problems, on the street in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and he died as a result of his injuries. Leach begged for his mum to help place the blame on his younger brother, Yorkshire Live reports. But both siblings were arrested and, yesterday, were each jailed for nine years at Sheffield Crown Court. Leach was charged with murder alongside his brother. Martin pleaded guilty to manslaughter at a plea, trial and preparation hearing and Leach admitted the charge on the day of trial. Both were acquitted of murder last month. Sara Martin was handed a two-year suspended sentence for a charge of perverting the course of justice, the same charge faced by Leach. The court heard she had gone along with her eldest son's account out of sympathy for her grandchildren. Sentencing the half-brothers, the Honourable Mr Justice Robin Knowles CBE said: "This is a depressing case and one that is not without its complexities. The foolish theft of a disability scooter by a disabled man from a disabled woman led to a cowardly attack on the deceased by two able-bodied men. It was started by Kyle Martin and Gareth Leach joined in. The vulnerability [of Mr Williamson] was known to both attackers, but not his vulnerability through illness." As all three defendants awaited their fate and a judge to return their sentence, Kyle Martin mused that he had "places to be" and sang: "You're f*****, you're f*****, you're really, really f*****" while his brother paced the room he had been placed in for the video link. Following the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Palmerm at South Yorkshire Policem said: "My thoughts are firstly with Dean's family and friends. Today's sentencing will not bring Dean back to his family, but I hope the end of the proceedings bring closure to all that knew and loved him. "Leach and Martin's actions that day were evil and twisted. I am pleased their sentences reflect their actions."  Leach, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was caught out in his own lies, and had been captured on dashcam footage in his white Picasso car telling his mother that the pair had "killed him." The dad of two could also be heard begging her to say it was his half-brother that was responsible for the killing. In the footage, played in court, Leach could be heard saying: "I've just killed him. Me and Kyle. We left him with broken ribs. I had to pull Kyle off him before he killed him. I threatened him and Kyle came and said, 'where is he?' He went and shouted, "I don't know what came over me...killed him. I had to get Kyle off, I thought he was going to kill him, literally kill him. "I didn't put my fists on him so there's no evidence. ... told me he'd bought it off someone. I said, 'I have got you on CCTV.' I told you didn't I, I told you. I knew it was a bad idea going today." Mobile phone analysis showed that just after that conversation, Ms Martin called her other son and was on the phone for around 30 seconds before she called Leach back. In that call he could be heard saying: "Tell them it's Kyle not me. I've got kids mum. I'm going to lose my kids, I'm going to lose everything. You have got to tell Kyle not to mention me." Later that same day, Leach was arrested and interviewed. The footage was not recovered until the next day so his mother was taken in for questioning as a witness and he handed a pre-prepared statement to police with his account that it was Martin, from Rotherham, that was responsible for the killing. When he was shown evidence of the footage a day later, he exercised his right to silence. Further footage recovered showed Leach talking to his two children, and laying the formation of his lies. He can be heard saying: "Uncle Kyle beat someone up, that man who robbed nanny's scooter. He beat them up proper. The police might come and see me but I haven't done anything wrong. I think they'll want to know the ins and outs of it and want to know I didn't have a part in it too because I didn't, I just stopped him."
