The crash occured at junction 23a on Monday morning (May 9). At least one southbound lane was shut near Castle Donington and traffic on both the M1 and the A50 are being affected by the accident. The lanes have since been reopened and the vehicles involved in the crash moved to the hard shoulder. However, traffic is still moving extremely slowly all the way to Long Eaton. Traffic cameras show queues of traffic on the approach to the scene of the crash. Long queues were seen on the southbound carriageway soon after 08:00am on Monday. It is unclear how long the disruption to traffic in the area will continue. It comes after a serious collision yesterday morning (May 8) closed the northbound M1 between Leicester and Loughborough for the majority of the day. UPDATES TO FOLLOW...
