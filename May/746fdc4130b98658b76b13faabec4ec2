Speaking about her mother, she detailed: "My late mother Edna, was diagnosed with vascular dementia back in 2003 or 2004, after my father's sudden death from a massive heart attack.

Due to this, she has had a strong involvement with the Alzheimer's Society for which she is an Ambassador. She is also the co-chair of the Dementia Friendly Communities Champion Group as part of the Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia. Angela also made a documentary with the BBC titled Dementia where she investigated Alzheimer's disease, furthering her knowledge. The BBC journalist recalled to Express.co.uk something she did on the documentary that changed her perspective of dementia. She said: "When I was making the documentary for the BBC about dementia, I was given the privilege of going to the national brain bank in Queens Square here in London and they allowed me with one of the clinicians to look at two brains that had been donated for research. "One was a perfectly healthy brain and it was painted with fat, it was heavy and then next to it was a brain from someone who had died with dementia. "When we sliced into the dementia brain, it was like having a slice of black lace because this was where the cells had died, there were just holes and they were not replenished. "And that is what dementia is. It's not just having a funny turn or being a bit forgetful. "Dementia is a serious disease of the brain. It takes away someone's personality. It doesn't just take away their memory. It takes away so many other things." Alzheimer’s Society’s Dementia Action Week (16-22 May) is all about making sure people know what symptoms to look out for and have the confidence to take the first step and visit their GP.
