With 912 square miles to explore, Britons will be spoilt for choice on a road trip in the Lake District. Some of the national parks’ most popular routes include the Keswick Loop and Grasmere to Windermere. The most challenging route, according to Vanarama, is the Coniston Loop which will test drivers with jaw dropping valleys. The second favourite road trip route and the most popular in Wales was Snowdonia which had more than 25,000 searches on YouTube. With nine mountain ranges, Snowdonia is packed full with adventurous activities for British staycationers. Dubbed ‘Highway to Heaven’ the route is one of the UK’s most stunning with many pretty villages to stop for a cup of tea. Britons shouldn’t leave without seeing Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales at 1,085m above sea level. Scotland’s North Coast took third place and is also the longest road trip route recommended by Vanarama. A whopping 516 mile trek, the route explores the jaw dropping Scottish highlands and should take around five days. Starting and finishing at Inverness Castle, Britons should also make a stop at John O’Groats for a photo. The Peak District was the fourth most popular road trip and is just a short drive from Sheffield or Manchester. 11) Cheddar Gorge12) Brecon Beacons13) Malvern Hills14) Giant’s Causeway15) Northumberland National Park16) Exmoor17) South Downs18) Cat and Fiddle19) Buttertubs20) Evo Triangle
