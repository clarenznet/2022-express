The 17-year-old, from Kyiv, has spent months attempting to join Reverend Jenny Kilgour, and her family, in Devon. But because she is not yet 18 years old she is considered to be an unaccompanied minor and has therefore found getting a visa impossible. Mr Gove said he and the Refugees Minister Richard Harrington were looking to help such instances. He said: "There will always be some cases where people don't qualify for the scheme but who do deserve our compassion. "We are looking at some of those people we haven't yet been able to help. In some cases those under the age of 18."
