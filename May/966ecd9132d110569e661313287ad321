Ferrari have locked out the front row for the Miami Grand Prix after a superb late push from Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz in Q3. However, they will both have one eye over their should with a pair of Red Bulls on the second row. Valtteri Bottas will start the race fifth, alongside former team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton came agonisingly close to crashing out in Q1, sitting 17th with three minutes left on the clock. Mercedes brought their man into the pits to change onto softer tyres and the Brit then went fifth fastest as Nicolas Latifi, Alex Albon, Zhou Guanyu and Kevin Magnussen went out. Only four of the usual five drivers were eliminated because Esteban Ocon did not compete in qualifying due to a damaged car from FP3. Hamilton continued to show his pace in Q2 but the same could not be said about his team-mate George Russell, who will start 12th on the grid. Mick Schumacher, Daniel Ricciardo, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso were also dumped out. Verstappen set a blistering lap early on in Q3 which looked as though it may not be beaten until Leclerc and Sainz turned up the heat. The former will start on pole, with Sainz in second.
