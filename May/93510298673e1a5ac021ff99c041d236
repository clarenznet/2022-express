It's almost time for the June 2022 PlayStation Plus free games reveal. A highlight of the month for PS Plus subscribers, the free PS4 and PS5 games will be unveiled at 4.30pm BST on June 1. The games will be available to download and play less than a week later on the morning of June 7. The next batch of PlayStation Plus releases will replace the current line-up of FIFA 22, Tribes of Midgard, and Curse of the Dead Gods. Needless to say, fans have been having fun making predictions in the build up to the big PS Plus reveal. Borderlands 3 is one of the more popular choices on the list, especially after it appeared as a free game on the Epic Store. As one reader points out, the game is also about to introduce cross-platform play across Stadia, PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is another popular choice. Star Wars games have also been a regular fixture for PS Plus in the month of June, after Star Wars Battlefront 2 was given away in June 2020, followed by Star Wars Squadrons in June 2021. First-party predictions include Sackboy: A Big Adventure, as well as Gravity Rush and Everybody's Golf. Other games with multiple predictions include Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Marvel's Avengers, and Hades. If recent months are anything to go by, there's a good chance the free PlayStation Plus games could leak ahead of schedule. Indeed, one leaker believes the June line-up will be headlined by God of War. That's alongside Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker. Be sure to check back at 4.30pm BST on June 1 for the official PlayStation Plus reveal. Express Online will update this story when the games are confirmed. If you want to join PS Plus at a discounted price, then you should head over to ShopTo where you can pick up a 12-month subscription for just Â£42.85.
