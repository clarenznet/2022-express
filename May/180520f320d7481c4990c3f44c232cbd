Carol Kirkwood, 59, announced the big news on BBC Breakfast after the weather forecaster left her co-stars Sally Nugent and Jon Kay speechless. The longstanding weather host revealed she is now engaged - 14 years following her split from her first husband. The BBC favourite recently gushed about finding love after her divorce from her ex-husband Jimmy but has kept her new romance low-key. The on-screen star has since shared the exciting news she is set to walk down the aisle for a second time. After she wrapped up her weather forecast, host Sally said she was a bit "concerned" for the weather presenter. "I don't know how you're managing to stand up with that giant rock on your left hand Carol?" Sally mused. The weather presenter chuckled: "Thank you Sal. It is rather nice. I got engaged." Carol confirmed she and her boyfriend got engaged while on holiday and added she is "thrilled". Viewers rushed to social media and congratulated the presenter. Brad wrote: "@carolkirkwood my 80 year old mum is a big fan of yours and looks forward to your weather reports every day. Visiting her today, sheâ€™s delighted at the news of your engagement. Good luck and enjoy Chelsea. Brad on behalf of Rosemary Smith, Cambridge." Maureen commented: "Congratulations on your engagement."
