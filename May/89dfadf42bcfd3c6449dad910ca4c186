The party won dozens of extra town hall seats, including snatching Hull City Council from Labour, which was an embarrassment for Sir Keir Starmer. The Lib-Dems also took seats from the Conservatives in places such as Stockport, Wimbledon and West Oxfordshire – David Cameron’s former backyard. The results follow a run of election thrashings which saw the party’s fortunes dwindle. Speaking in front of party activists on Wimbledon Common, Sir Ed said: “We are going to have a Liberal Democrat MP for Wimbledon at the next election. And I think there are other places where we’re going to see Liberal Democrat success for the first time ever. “I’m really excited about the South-west of England and coming back there. I’m excited about all those seats across the Blue Wall which, frankly, we haven’t been players in for a long time.” He also said more needed to be done to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.
