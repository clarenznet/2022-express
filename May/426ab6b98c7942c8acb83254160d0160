The subsidy will be applied to properties rather than individuals, so those with multiple homes could rack up significantly higher savings. The Chancellor is believed to own three homes in the UK, including a house and flat in central London plus a sprawling estate in his Yorkshire constituency. That could give him a £1,200 benefit. Mr Sunak, 42, who is the first Cabinet minister to appear on the Sunday Times Rich List with a family fortune of around £730million, said he would hand the rebate over to charity. He told Sky News interviewer Niall Paterson: "You, like me, can also give that money to charity if you don't need it. I'm sure you will, and set an example." Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast: "Second homes account for one or two percent of the property stock." Boris Johnson has stakes in multiple homes but they are thought to be rented out while neither he nor Mr Sunak pay utility bills at Downing Street and Chequers residences. An estimated 770,000 households own two homes not routinely rented out while 60,000 have three.
