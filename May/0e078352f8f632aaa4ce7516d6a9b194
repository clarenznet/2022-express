His Williams FW16 car was travelling at nearly 200 miles an hour when it smashed into a concrete wall. Considered the most talented driver of his generation, Senna predicted in an interview: "We'll be lucky if something serious doesn't happen this year." 70 years ago (1952) The world's first commercial jet airliner took off on its maiden flight from London to Johannesburg. The De Havilland Comet 1 took almost a day to finish the 7,000-mile journey. But problems with the Comet would emerge with three planes lost in 12 months. 40 years ago (1982) Argentine cruiser the General Belgrano was sunk in the Falklands War by the Royal Navy submarine Conqueror, with the loss of 323 lives. The sinking remains controversial as the Belgrano was hit outside the 200-mile exclusion zone around the islands and may have been returning to port. She remains the only ship to have been sunk during a military operation by a nuclear-powered submarine.
