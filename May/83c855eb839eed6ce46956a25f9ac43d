Aussie actress Nicole Kidman, 54, has been in Hong Kong, where she's busy filming for the new Amazon series Expats. As action got underway to complete the series, which is based on the 2016 novel The Expatriate, Nicole shared a photo of her wrinkle and blemish-free complexion. Oscar and BAFTA-winning Nicole also shared make-up free photos of herself chatting with the executive producer of the series, Lulu Wang. She had earlier sparked controversy for being granted an exemption from Hong Kong's quarantine rules, after originally jetting in last year while the coronavirus pandemic was still at large. Hong Kong authorities stated that the exemption from the one week quarantine, compulsory for other travellers, was due to her participating in work activities which would boost the local economy. Meanwhile, Nicole is co-executive producing the series too.
