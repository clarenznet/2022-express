The single storey dwelling which has just about enough room for your average car would set you back a fortune. Sellers claim the property would give the buyer the perfect opportunity for a project in the heart of Gosforth's Conservation Area, reports Chronicle Live. But Newcastle Chronicle readers were left baffled by the price tag. One wrote: "Worthy of Grand Designs not for people who can't afford it." Another said: "Hope it’s an electric opening door for that price!." And one commented: "Is there £1,980,000 in £50 notes inside?"   The reason the garage commands such a hefty price tag is due to the plot of land it is located on. Graham Park in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of the most exclusive streets in the North East, where properties sold for an average price of £1,623,000 over the last year.  In October 2018, a six bedroom detached property two houses down from the site sold for £1,375,000 - since then prices have dramatically risen, which is why the asking price for the plot of land featuring a garage and a tennis court is so high. Graham Park Road attracts the region’s higher-budget family buyers, drawn to the late 19th century architecture, mature gardens and proximity to amenities and schools.  The plot, which extends to 760 square metres, has planning permission for a detached property which upon completion would offer approximately 450m² of gross floor area across three levels.   Plans are available via Newcastle City Council 'Public Access' service or by request from Bradley Hall Gosforth. * Graham Park Road, Gosforth, Newcastle, is for sale with a guide price of £1.2m and is being marketed by Bradley Hall Chartered Surveyors & Estate Agents.
