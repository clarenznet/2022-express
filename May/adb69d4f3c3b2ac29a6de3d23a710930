Nine-month-old Nova beat off stiff competition from corgis, cockerpoos, sprockers and Hungarian vizslas to win the title. Pet care website Rover launched a search for Britain's most patriotic dog to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of the animal-loving Queen. Dog owners were urged to enter their pooches to be judged for manners, potential royal associations, such as names or heritage, and appreciation for Her Majesty. Our 96-year-old monarch is famously fond of Pembroke Welsh corgis and has owned more than 30 since becoming Queen in 1952. But she has also kept other breeds and alongside her five corgis in 2007, had five cocker spaniels and four dorgis (dachshund-corgi crossbreeds). Australian cobberdogs are purebred labradoodles known for their gentle temperament.  Nova is owned by Amna Ahmad, 35, from south London, who described her as "cheeky, silly and loving". She added: "I've always thought Nova had something regal about her! "I saw the competition and knew she was the perfect fit. "I'm delighted that she has won the acclaim she deserves." Amna and Nova have won a Â£150 prize package and a Doggy Afternoon Tea for Two at a London hotel. Highly commended entrants included Wilbur and Lil'Pumpkin, both corgis; Wilson, a cockerpoo; Princess Margaret, a cocker spaniel; Bodie, a sprocker; Jupiter, a Hungarian vizsla and Frida, a wire-haired dachshund.
