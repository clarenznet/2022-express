However, 78 percent admitted a lack of social interaction would be a key consideration to changing jobs. In fact, 25 percent, of 18-41-year-olds, thought about switching jobs in the past year due to concerns for their mental health. But there was also a large generational divide, as 18 percent of Gen Zs prioritise flexibility, while 34 percent of Millennials consider a high salary to be important. And 38 percent of Gen Zs also value an employer which champions diversity, equity and inclusion, while 29 percent of Millennials most value an employer that champions sustainability. Steve Cassidy, senior vice president and managing director in UK and Ireland for Hilton, which commissioned the research, said: “Our research shows the pandemic has shifted how we think about work. I am proud Hilton has continued to evolve to meet the ever-changing needs of its teams. “We lead with culture and are fiercely committed to create a truly diverse and meaningful work environment where individuals are empowered with the tools, technology, and culture to unleash their full potential.” The research also found having a good work-life balance was a key reason for 39 percent of Millennials and Gen Zs staying in their current roles. However, 66 per cent of Millennials and Gen Zs have considered a career in hospitality over the past 12 months. Of those, having flexible working hours (21 percent), good travel perks (19 percent) and career development opportunities (16 percent), are what they valued from a job. Steve Cassidy, from Hilton, which is looking to recruit more than 1,400 team members across its hotels, added: “We know when we invest in our team members, our guests and communities also benefit. “It’s why we’re so committed to providing so many benefits, from life-changing travel opportunities, to ensuring a sense of belonging for every team member.” TOP 10 MOST IMPORTANT WORK PERKS
