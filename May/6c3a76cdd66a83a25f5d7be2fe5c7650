In the aftermath of major terrorist incidents and tragedies I have seen their combination of clinical professionalism and human kindness. I am proudly pro-police and anyone who feels differently should vote for someone else. This Government understands that in order to cut crime, level up the country and make sure people feel safe, we need to back our police officers with the right tools and powers. We are funding the police to the tune of almost £17billion this year. And we are helping the police tackle violence against women and girls through investment in more CCTV and street lighting. On Tuesday at the annual Police Federation Conference, I spoke about two recent policy decisions. I am strengthening stop and search powers as it is vital to get knives off our streets and save lives. These powers have contributed to more than 50,000 weapons being removed from our streets since 2019 already. On top of this, I am authorising Special Constables to carry and use Tasers. Backing the police also means making it easier for them to call out the minority of officers who fall short of the standards we should expect.  Some have fallen hugely short, misusing social media or abusing their power for sexual purposes. The horrendous rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer shocked the whole country. I set up the Angiolini inquiry, which will establish whether previous allegations against her killer were handled the right way, so we can get answers, especially for her family. I promised to recruit an additional 20,000 police officers by next March. We already have an additional 13,500. I’ve championed the Police Covenant, which will provide serving and former members of the service with continued health and wellbeing support, as well as protection. Today I am making clear I would welcome the Police Federation back to the table on discussions around pay. Police officers run towards danger. They have my backing.
