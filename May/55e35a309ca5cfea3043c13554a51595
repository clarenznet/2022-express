Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, said many of the 124,000 missing "ghost" pupils have never come back to school after being kept away in Covid lockdowns - and Government proposals to deal with the problem do not go far enough. The MP wants schools to recruit staff who will visit parents and round up absent children. A SchoolsWhite Paper published last week details plans for a register of missing children, designed to help ensure no child is lost from the system. But Mr Halfon said: "What is needed is schools engaging with parents - field workers reaching out, bringing children back to school." He suggested that schools could employ additional staff using their share of the Â£5billion "catch up" funding from the Government to help pupils make up for lost education. He said: "The Secretary of State should have a computer on his desk which shows every school in the country where pupils are absent, and how many there are." Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza, the Government-appointed watchdog for children, found in a recent study that many authorities do not know how many children in their area are missing school, being educated at home or are out of education altogether.
