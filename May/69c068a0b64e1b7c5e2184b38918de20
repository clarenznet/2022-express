But Raiola's cocksure style and knack of always getting the best deal for his millionaire charges led him to cross swords with many, including former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis. He also fell out with Pep Guardiola, but his most famous disagreement was with Ferguson. After spotting Pogba's talent early on, he became the player's agent while he was still at United's academy. Raiola managed to spirit Pogba out of Manchester United to Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, and four years later brokered a deal for him to return to Old Trafford for a transfer fee of around £89million. Raiola was rumoured to have pocketed around £20million from that move. Describing his anger at the move years later, the Scot said: "I distrusted Pogba's agent from the moment I met him." Raiola couldn't care less and revelled in upsetting football boardrooms. He would walk out of meetings for the slightest reason and gave little ground in contract deals. Born in Nocera Inferiore in southern Italy, Raiola grew up in the Netherlands, eventually working in his father's chain of pizzerias. After a brief football career Raiola began working as an agent, assisting with high-profile Dutch players' moves to Italian clubs. He set up business in the mid-90s to become one of the richest and most powerful agents in football. He died in hospital in Milan following a long illness.
