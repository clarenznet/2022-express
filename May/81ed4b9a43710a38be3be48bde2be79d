A van ploughed into the back of the lorry barely five minutes after it became stranded on the inside lane. Witnesses said the driver was lucky to be pulled alive from the mangled wreckage. He’s now in hospital with serious injuries. On and on goes this sheer madness, the mounting injuries and deaths as inevitable as the tides and as dangerous as a tsunami. This latest crash on what used to be the hard shoulder safe haven comes after a woman died less than two months ago on a stretch of M4 “smart’”motorway. Pulvinder Dhillon, 68, perished when her broken-down car was struck by a van. Again, SVD cameras are thought to have failed. Memo to transport minister Grant Shapps. For pity’s sake, switch on the Red Xs above ALL inside lanes of ALL “smart” motorways NOW and give us back our life-saving hard shoulders.
