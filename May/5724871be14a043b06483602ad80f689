Keith Anderson, who runs Scottish Power, is urging the Government to take action to help the poorest households as prices are spiralling out of control. He warned four in 10 could fall into fuel poverty by October if ministers do not tackle it immediately. Mr Anderson said bills are likely to go up by nearly another £1,000 for millions when Ofgem’s price cap is reviewed in October. The Prime Minister’s spokesman did not rule out this figure. He said: “With Ofgem, we do expect further increases later in the year. The Chancellor made clear we will look to do what we can when we know more about what the prices will be.” Mr Anderson said in a BBC interview yesterday: “Given what’s going to happen in October, we think urgent action is required to support customers through this.” Households had a 54 percent rise in the energy tariff price cap on April 1, adding about £700 to annual bills and taking them close to £2,000. Mr Anderson said the Government’s plan to give £200 towards the energy bill – a sum that will need to be paid back – is insufficient. Ofgem said: “Our priority is to protect consumers, making sure bill payers pay a fair price and we engage with suppliers to ensure they are treating and billing consumers fairly.” An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Our top priority is to protect consumers including making sure bill payers pay a fair price and we engage with suppliers to ensure they are treating and billing consumers fairly. “We know this is a challenging time and customers struggling to pay for energy may be eligible for extra help such as debt repayment plans, emergency credit for prepayment metered customers and priority support. “Higher energy bills are never welcome and any customer worried about bills should contact their supplier to access available support.”
