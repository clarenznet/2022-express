On Friday morning, armed officers were pictured scouring moorland in Salford. A footpath from the corner of Heathland Road and Wensley Road onto Kersal Moor was cordoned off using blue and white crime scene tape. Greater Manchester Police Salford wrote on Twitter: “We’ve evacuated a small number of properties in the Kersal Moor area after a suspicious item was found during an isolated & contained search operation. “EOD are at the scene as a precaution to make an assessment of the item. “There is no known risk to the wider public.” According to the Manchester Evening News, at least one police van was parked close to the path entrance, with officers also stationed there. Two other police vehicles, including a van and car, were also pictured stationed on nearby Moor Lane. No further details have been given on the specific investigation. It has not yet been confirmed how long the search will go on for. Ramazani Mwamba, a MEN reporter, said on Twitter “it’s mainly the homes close to the footpath that leads onto the moor that have been evacuated”. He added: “Bomb disposal unit are on the scene and this is what it was like a few hours ago when the bomb disposal robot was deployed.” Mr Mwamba also reported “Salford City Council have also been called for assistance”, and said Kersal ward councillor Ari Lietner “is here helping residents who have been evacuated”.
