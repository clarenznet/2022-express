Monkeypox can be passed on through direct contact during sex, or via clothing, bedding or towels and through coughs and sneezes. The disease is usually mild but can cause severe illness in certain patients. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face and spreading to other parts, of the body, including the genitals, before lesions appear. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, thanked people affected for coming forward, saying they were "helping us limit the spread of this infection". She added: "We are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have symptoms." Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a nine-year-old. It has now been found in 16 countries outside Africa.
