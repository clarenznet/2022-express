Petro Poroshenko, who was leader of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, said his country will reclaim not only the Donbas region but also Crimea, which was annexed by the Russians at the start of his Presidency. He added that Putin posed a threat not only to “neighbouring countries” but the world if he was not removed from office in Russia.    Mr Poroshenko said: “All Ukrainian land including Crimea, including Donbas, including Kherson, we will definitely liberate. “Exactly like how the Supreme commander and chief of Ukrainian armed forces in 2014 made Mariupol free. Together they also occupied two-thirds of the Donbas. “We did that in 2014 and we will do that the same now.” GB News presenter Darren McCaffrey then asked: “Do you think Ukraine will not settle now?”    He added: “Does Ukrainian victory mean pushing Russians out of not just the Donbas region but maybe even Crimea too?” Former President Poroshenko said: “Please, remove ‘even’. Donbas, definitely. Crimea, definitely. And point number three: De-Putinise Russia. “De-Putinise Europe and de-Putinise the world. If we do not do that, in one or two years time, Putin can knock at the door of any neighbouring countries. “Or maybe not neighbouring. Now Putin is completely unpredictable.” READ MORE: Putin's power under threat as Russian leader 'loses trust’ [REVEAL]   Since Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul in late March to discuss peace in the region, there has been “no significant changes, no progress”, according to a Ukrainian official.

Russia does not demonstrate the key – the understanding of today’s processes in the world and (Russia’s) extremely negative role.” He added Russia’s political elite were afraid of admitting the truth and would “continue negotiations as an element of their propaganda only for domestic use”.
