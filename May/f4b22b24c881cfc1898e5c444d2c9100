Princess Charlene showed off her svelte figure with a thin navy belt which pulled her in at the waist. The dress continued below the belt into a long pleated skirt which cut off above the ankles. In some photos, the royal was seen wearing a pair of large black sunglasses.  She took these off a number of times during the outing to show a glam makeup look. This included lashing of mascara, a slick of bronzer and a nude lip gloss. The mother-of-two wore her short platinum blonde hair swept to the side of her face. She had on a pair of silver earrings and her large engagement ring was on show. This was a rare outing from the Princess following a number of health issues recently. She stayed out of the public eye as she was stuck in her native South Africa after contracting a serious sinus infection. Princess Charlene has only made one other public appearance this year. This was last week when the 44-year-old was seen at the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship in Monaco. Royal fans used social media to comment on her appearance today. One shared their appreciation of seeing the family back together. They simply wrote "reunited" with a love heart emoji. Another user "ora1185" posted: "Nice family". Another added: "super photos, I adore." Instagram user Hilary said: "Stunning pictures."
