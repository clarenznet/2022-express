The Â£159 levy will be frozen for the next two years and in 2027 it is set to be ditched for a new funding model. Mr Davie told the Deloitte Media and Telecoms conference yesterday: "We are not trying to be Netflix, we are trying to be the BBC. "I believe we will still offer great value for the licence fee. We have some choices to make. I think we will still be able to offer a great service." On levelling up, Mr Davie said the BBC's biggest challenge was staying "relevant", adding: "It's all about local economic growth - we are very bullish about that." But Rebecca Ryan, of campaigners Defund the BBC, said the world had "moved on" and told the corporation to "step out into the big wide world". Channel 4 boss Alex Mahon said at the event: "Audiences want content from the UK. It's about how we evolve our business to capture that. "The reason the landscape is so strong is because of the competitiveness we have here."
