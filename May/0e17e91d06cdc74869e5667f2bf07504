The PGA Championship is the second major tournament of the year, and a capacity crowd is expected to flock to Southern Hills, which is hosting the event for first time since 2007. Tiger Woods won that year, and fans will be desperate to see the best golfers on the planet contend for glory in 2022 - including Dustin Johnson. Johnson, who turned professional aged 23 back in 2007, has already claimed two major titles when he won the 2016 US Open and the 2020 Masters, with the latter coming at a canter. He shattered the course record by finishing -20. The 37-year-old overcame injuries and off-course issues to climb to World No. 1 while winning tournaments along the way. With rumours rife, an official PGA Tour announcement in 2014 declared Johnson was stepping away from the sport and he was not suspended, with the American claiming he was seeking help for ‘personal challenges’. When he returned in 2015, Johnson found form to return to the top 15 and reached world number one status in 2017. With his win at the Genesis Open that year, Johnson had secured a title in each of his first 10 seasons - a feat previously only accomplished by legends Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.

This is largely aided by his impressive £53.5m earned in tournament prize money over the course of his career. If you include the £11.5m he won at the 2020 FedEx Cup, Johnson is the third-highest earning golfer in history behind Woods (approximately £92m) and Phil Mickelson (£70m). Even without the FedEx Cup money, the 2020 Masters champion is the fifth highest-earning golfer of all-time.
