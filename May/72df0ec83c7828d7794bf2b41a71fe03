Virgin Media is offering customers the chance to grab ultra-fast broadband at a price that's pretty hard to believe. The firm's fastest 1Gbps service, which can download a full HD movie in under 40 seconds, usually costs £62 per month but right now it's on offer for just £28 - that's a saving of over £30 per month. Along with its Gig1 plan being cheaper, Virgin has also slashed the price of its M200, M350 and M500 speeds with all of these plans also now costing £28. That's easily the best Virgin Media broadband deal we've heard of in a long time. The only catch that you need to be aware of is that these low prices only last for six months before returning to the standard price. For example, those signing up for Virgin's Gig1 plan will pay £28 for the first six months then £62 for the remaining 12 months of the 18-month contract. Here are all of the deals available from Virgin right now.

That's £1 cheaper than Virgin and that price lasts for the entire 24-month contract, not just the first six months. If 500Mbps doesn't sound fast enough there's more good news as Community Fibre has also slashed the price of its ludicrously quick 3Gbps service which now costs £50 per month rather than the usual £89.
