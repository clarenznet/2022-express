Royal commentator Daniela Elser said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had a "fairly easy go of things" with the Queen at the helm of the monarchy following Megxit despite their bombshell interviews. Writing for news.com.au, Ms Elser said: "So, what happens, both in a personal and a royal sense, when she passes away and Charles takes the reins? (Or should that be reigns? Sorry, I couldn't resist.) "There is every chance that Harry and Meghan might face a much less sympathetic time of it." Ms Elser said a photo of the Prince of Wales at the State Opening of Parliament shows the Queen's reign is "every day drawing just a bit closer to closing" and "should panic" and be a "cause for serious alarm" for Harry and Meghan. She said: "This hands-off approach on the part of the Palace could very possibly go out the window under King Charles III. "He has waited a literal lifetime for the top job and his willingness to sit back and take whatever Molotov media cocktails the Sussexes might lob at the Palace in the future could be very, very limited."
