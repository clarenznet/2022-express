Sir Keir and members of the delegation talked about the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, which secured peace in the province, with a "working" deal. They also discussed the need to be creative and ambitious in trade talks with between London and Washington as well as the importance of Western unity in the face of Russian aggression in Europe.
