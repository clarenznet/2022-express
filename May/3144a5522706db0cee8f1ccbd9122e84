You are being expected to abide by other people’s wishes and demands. You’re starting to feel resentful of others who try to interfere with your life and the sooner you break free from this situation, the better. Feelings of restlessness and a need for change has been with you for a while. Sometimes it feels as if you are banging your head against a brick wall. One problem after another makes it difficult to sort out a frustrating dilemma. As well as not being able to make any progress in your own affairs, a colleague is expecting your help in a matter you would prefer not to get involved in. Criticism of your work will make it feel as if a colleague is deliberately picking on you. Don’t make any rash decisions based on another person’s cruel or insensitive comments. Rather than dignifying their remarks with a response, quietly walk away. If you allow anyone to undermine your confidence, you have let them win.  It’s alright to have fun and to be silly occasionally. A little frivolity is not being stupid. It is in fact a way to loosen up and release tension. Revisit childhood memories and reconnect with your inner child. Creative and artistic pastimes will give you a lot of pleasure. Procrastination will only hold you back and leave you wondering about the good prospects you have let slip by. Through being more appreciative of the opportunities that now lay in your path, you will be more likely to make the most of the good things that come your way. Although work and private responsibilities aren’t minimal, it would be wise to keep an eye on what a competitor is getting up to. In legal and financial matters, read correspondence and contracts very carefully or you could miss something interesting in the small print.  Tension is in the air and money seems to be the main bone of contention. Nothing seems to go right but forget the date. It has nothing to do with unlucky numbers or any other superstition. Difficulties can be resolved if you take a more positive approach to unexpected problems. You can’t be expected to do everything. A colleague is getting very clever at shirking their responsibilities. This is starting to cause problems for you. You are doing the work of two yet receiving little in the way of compensation. Be sure those in charge are made aware of the situation. A friend or partner’s irresponsible actions could cause you to rethink your relationship. Before acting hastily consider whether your lack of belief in their abilities has caused them to behave in this way. A heart-to-heart talk would be better than issuing an ultimatum. Discussions give you a better understanding of the situation.  You hardly have time to think when demands come your way from all directions. Once you do manage to sit down, you won’t want to get back up again. It will hit you how much you have managed to get through and on top of this revelation you will realise how tired this has made you. A job vacancy will catch your eye. You may not have been intending to make a career change but this post holds a special attraction. If you think you’ve got what it takes to go for it, send in an application and leave the rest to Fate. If this job is meant for you, it will happen. A partner will take up an opportunity that will give them a taste of new experiences. Try your best not to feel too possessive. Have you just started dating someone new? Take your time as they may not be ready yet to give up their independence.
