  Steph McGovern has given a rare insight into her family plans with her partner, who she chooses to keep out of the spotlight. The Steph’s Packed Lunch star gave a surprisingly candid interview about their relationship and what it’s like to be a mother.   Steph, 39, spoke about whether she might consider welcoming more children into the world. The former BBC Breakfast presenter and her wife announced the birth of their two-year-old daughter back in November 2019. Steph said: “I don’t think more children are on the cards. It’s a bit like the Strictly question.” The presenter was referencing her own uncertainty over whether she would be interested in competing in the hit BBC One show, Strictly Come Dancing, in the future.      “It feels like a no but I’m not going to say a definitive no because you don’t know,” she explained. “I say to my younger friends ‘don’t wait for somebody perfect or financial perfection because it doesn’t happen’. “Just crack on. Being a mum keeps me healthy because I want to be around as long as possible.” During the interview, Steph also explained how it was important to “normalise” being part of a family with same-sex parents.     “I talk about it in a way that any parent would, I just don’t say their names,” she explained in her interview with Woman & Home Magazine. Steph has always kept the identity of her long-term partner a secret, though it has been revealed she is a TV executive at the BBC. The star has consistently set very clear boundaries with the media, declining to share her family members' names or to post any pictures of her wife and daughter. In a previous interview with The Herald, she said: “My rule is, I never put my family on there. READ MORE...

Back in November 2020, Steph confirmed for the first time that she had given birth to her daughter in an Instagram post. She penned at the time: “Well hello world, just surfaced to let you know that we now have a daughter! “Born on Monday morning just as @BBCBreakfast was wrapping up. We’re all fine and dandy. Just getting used to the eau de sick/poo I am now regularly wearing. #babylife.” The July issue of Woman & Home is on sale Wednesday 25 May 2022.
