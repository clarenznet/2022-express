Liverpool fan Neal Skupski has admitted defeat in his bid to go to the Stade de France tonight (sat) after winning through to the third round of the men's doubles. The world doubles No.12 had secured a ticket for the Champions League final across Paris from Roland-Garros.  But Skupski, who is the No.6 seed pairing with Dutchman Wesley Koolhof, said: “I’m going to be playing Saturday, so I’m not going to take the chance. “I’m going to be watching it in the hotel rooms. “I wouldn’t want to take it away from some other Liverpudlian. It’s through a contact and then they contacted Liverpool so I’ve had to pass on it. “It’s very difficult for me to pass up on this opportunity. If I wasn’t here, for sure I would have gone.”   World No.16 Argentine Diego Schwartzmann yesterday beat Grigor Dimitrov to reach the fourth round of the singles - and used his post-match press conference to ask tournament organisers to get him a ticket. “Roland Garros, I know you can do it,” said the Argentine. No.10 seeds Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares lost in the second round to American pairing MacKenzie McDonald and Tommy Paul 7-6 4-6 6-3. But No.1 seeds Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram beat Miomir Kecmanovic and Nicolas Monroe 6-3 7-6.
