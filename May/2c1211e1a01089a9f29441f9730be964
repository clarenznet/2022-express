PlayStation and Xbox fans could be treated to some new consoles as early as next year. That's according to a new leak which has emerged today, claiming that mid-generation upgrades for the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S could launch as early as 2023. This news was highlighted by Tom Henderson, the leaker best known for his Call of Duty, Battlefield and more recently GTA 6 leaks. In a post on Twitter Henderson revealed how chip maker TCL in a presentation claimed a PS5 Pro and new Xbox Series X and S consoles could launch in either 2023 or 2024. Henderson tweeted: "In a new conference, TCL Technology have said that a new Xbox Series S/X and PS5 Pro are coming in 2023/2024." Pictures taken from the event also gave expected specs for the PS5 Pro and new Xbox Series X and S consoles. These consoles will allegedly be capable of 8K visuals at 120Hz and have a GPU equivalent to AMD's RX7700XT, whereas the TCL slide says the PS5 and Xbox Series X is similar to a RX6700XT GPU.   The pictures of the TCL presentation were originally published byÂ Polish website PPE. And while a potential mid-generation upgrade for the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S in 2023 or 2024 may seem too soon to many gamers, this would be in keeping with previous timeframes. The PS4 and Xbox One consoles launched in 2013 with the PS4 Pro out in 2016 and the Xbox One X releasing in 2017. With the past generation, it was either three or four years between the original console launching and the mid-generation upgrade hitting shelves. So if a PS5 Pro or new Xbox Series X or S launch in 2023 or 2024 that would be similar timings. Yes, it may seem hard to believe to you - especially if you've struggled to buy a next-gen console - but both the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S have been out for some time now. Despite the stock shortages which have persisted since launch, both Sony and Microsoft's latest consoles have been out for over a year and a half. And this November will mark two years since these systems first hit shelves.
