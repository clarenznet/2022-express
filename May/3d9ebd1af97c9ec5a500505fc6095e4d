“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on Earth. For your entertainment tonight I give you the hilarious Partygate! (toots party horn). Followed by the shameful spectacle of Porngate! (bassoon). Then, for tonight’s grand finale (drum roll), we bring you the chilling saga of Beergate! (cymbals). “And, courtesy of Durham Police, Beergate’s nail-biting denouement (crashing crescendo) – The Resignation of the Upstanding One. Will he or won’t he be stuck on his moral high horse forever, his career in tatters? Tonight we present to you the leaders of the nation as you’ve never seen them before!” Aren’t our MPs ashamed of what’s going on in the name of Parliament, our highest legislature, the elected representatives of the people... those who make the laws under which we live? Aren’t they aware of our growing contempt? They should be. Is Keir Starmer, really going to resign if Durham Police decide he was at an illegal lockdown party and didn’t return to work after he finished his beer and vindaloo? How mad is that? Is this a serious country? Or is the British Government a shrieking kindergarten where local plod decide who’s in and who’s out? Couldn’t the mobile phone porn fiasco have been sorted out with intelligence and dignity instead of hysterical publicity? What happened to HR, to quiet words and warnings? Having claimed the moral high ground, hoping to leave Boris sinking in the stinking Partygate swamp below, Starmer is hoist with his own petard. Does he care more for his saintly conscience than the future of the Labour Party? Or the country? This is government for Twitter, not the people. Once again – just as they were during the interminable Brexit years – MPs are high on their own publicity, but it’s incredibly tiresome for the rest of us, not to mention demeaning. With a hideous war raging in Europe and terrifying inflation here, we need wisdom not circus acts... don’t send in the clowns.
