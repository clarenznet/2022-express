Durham Police confirmed on Friday that it would be investigating the Labour leader for a potential Covid rules breach in April 2021. The Labour leader was pictured with a bottle in his hand alongside other people, at roughly the same time the Prime Minister and Chancellor attended lockdown parties they were fined for. A Durham Constabulary spokesperson said: ”Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham Constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted." Sir Keir’s focus has been taking down the Prime Minister for his proven breach of breaking lockdown rules for attending a birthday party thrown in his honour. But now his credibility is being questioned thanks to the investigation, which was announced on the day Labour made significant gains in local elections across Britain. So, do you think Keir Starmer should resign if he’s found guilty of breaching lockdown rules? Do you think the Labour leader is a hypocrite?
