Miss Congeniality and Speed star Sandra Bullock might have been in showbusiness for almost 35 years, but she still looks just as radiant as she did when her acting career first began. Fresh-faced American actress Sandra started carving out her path to fame with just a minor role in the thriller Hangmen, back in 1987. The Hollywood icon's Working Girl TV series then followed just a year later, to great acclaim. Her first big break was in the 1993 sci-fi movie Demolition Man, when she showed off her classic good looks with a bob haircut. As Sandra's fans know, major roles have been pouring in for her ever since. The series of photos shows how The Lost City star Sandra has evolved from the radiant newcomer who first hit screens in the late 80s at the tender age of 22, but it is also clear the talented actress has not lost a jot of her legendary sex appeal along the way.
