Police were at Inchmickery Court in Muirhouse, in the north of the Scottish city for several hours. A 23-year-old and two men, aged 32, have been arrested in connection with the house break ins. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: “Around 8.30am on Thursday, 19 May, officers attended after receiving a report of a fire and housebreakings at a block of flats on Inchmickery Court in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. “One man aged 23 and two men aged 32 have been arrested in connection with the housebreaking and enquiries remain ongoing.” “The fire was extinguished by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and is currently being treated as unexplained.” A witness said the block of flats was cordoned off. Residents were not permitted to go in or out of the flats. They told the local Edinburgh Evening News: “The fire crews turned up in the morning and I think they wanted into one of the flats. “There was shouting through a door but because of the high winds and height of the building it was impossible to hear what was being said. “Then the police turned up in the full gear. Armed officers, what looked like two vanloads from a support unit. “The building was sealed off so no one was getting in or out. There's often incidents at these flats and folk outside like me – I had popped out to walk the dog – can't get back in.”
