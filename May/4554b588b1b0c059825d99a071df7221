The Sue Gray investigation into Downing Street lockdown gatherings has been published. Ms Gray's report included that "many of these events should not have been allowed to happen" and staff felt "unable" to raise concerns about behaviour. She also detailed that she was made aware of "multiple examples" when there was a lack of respect or "poor treatment" for security and cleaning staff. "The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture," Ms Gray added. Reflecting on the report, former special adviser Dominic Cummings said: "He doesn't think he did anything wrong, as he said repeatedly in 2020 'Everyone better remember I'm the f****** Fuhrer around here.'"
