The Post Office is the UK’s national postal services, meaning it ensures letters and parcels are delivered across the country. But the Post Office also runs some banking services, including some international bank transfers, which it provides through Western union. These are both trusted companies, so sending your hard-earned money abroad through this way is a safe process. To send money overseas, you first need to register with the Post Office to start transferring money. You can do this on a desktop, mobile or tablet device. Simply type in Ukraine and select how much money you’d like to transfer. You can send up to £8,000 at one time. The screen will then show you two options. Select whether the receiver wants to receive the money as cash, or as a bank transfer. You can make the transfer either as a bank transfer from your UK current account, or by interring your credit or debit card details. Once you’ve gone through the full process, the money will be available to the recipient within minutes. The Post Office says: “If your money is needed within minutes, you can send online using your credit or debit card. “Recipients can pick up cash at Western Union locations worldwide, depending on the hours of operation at that location. “ If your recipient lives in a country where we offer mobile money transfer, you can send money to their mobile phone in minutes. Make sure your receiver has activated a mobile wallet with one of our partner mobile operators in their country. “If you send money to a bank account, your money's generally available in up to 2 working days, depending on your recipient country.” The rates are also much lower than many other providers, and the rate you’ll pay will be made clear to you when you make the transfer.
