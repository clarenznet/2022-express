Actress Blake Lively, 34, and her husband Ryan Reynolds, 45, both co-chairs of the prestigious fashion event, stunned on the Met Gala red carpet tonight. Taking to the red carpet, the Hollywood couple posed for pictures and they looked ever so in love. It's the first time the couple have attended the event together since 2017. Ryan wore a black tuxedo while Blake was dressed in custom Atelier Versace. Blake's pink, on first impression, dress proceeded to shock Ryan and onlookers, as it opened up to reveal icey blue fabric. Ryan's jaw hit the floor when he saw Blake's outfit transformation, in an adorable candid moment. This year's Met Gala theme is "Gilded Glamour and White Tie" which is inspired by theÂ extravagant era of American fashion in the last decades of the 19th century. The Gilded Age was a 30-year period during which industrialists and real estate magnates became even wealthier. The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser that raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.
