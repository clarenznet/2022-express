The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have extended their lease with a 12-month rolling deal at the property which is a stone's throw away from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's residence and a ten-minute walk from the Queen’s apartments. Harry and Meghan are expected to stay at the cottage for the Jubilee celebrations with son Archie, three, and daughter Lilibet, who turns one on Saturday. The royal pair had lived in the cottage for an unhappy six months before abandoning royal duties and moving abroad in 2020. Royal insiders believe the Sussexes, who have a £13million mansion in California, plan to spend more time in Windsor. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
