IOn March 4, a 37-year-old woman, who, according to the police, was a drug addict, broke into the man’s home in Birmingham to steal money from him. The burglar entered two other homes on Hasbury Road, Bartley Green and stole from two other pensioners and a support worker. When she forced herself into the 87-year-old man’s home, Samantha McDonnell was confronted by him. She then brutally attacked him, leaving him with a broken nose and a brain bleed, and then escaped with the pensioner’s bank card. During the attack, McDonnell even unplugged the victim’s phone to stop him from calling for help. Neighbours raised the alarm and the elderly person, who was found battered on the floor, was rushed to the hospital where he received treatment for his severe injuries. He has since been released from the hospital, but he had to move to a new home due to not feeling safe. Through West Midlands Police, the victim’s family released a photo of the man to show how bad the injuries inflicted by McDonnell were. The horrific picture shows the man with two swollen eyes and blood all over his face and head. McDonnell was found through DNA evidence left in the flat and she was arrested at her home in Bartley Green one day later.
