Around £600million is being invested in training specialists to track down fraudsters. Some staff will also be given new powers to arrest and search suspects, under the plan to claw back around £2billion in three years. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: "The welfare system is there to help the most vulnerable. "It is not a cash machine for callous criminals." Under the "fighting fraud in the welfare system" plan, 2,000 investigators will review two million Universal Credit claims. Government Efficiency Minister Jacob Rees - Mogg said: "Taxpayers must have confidence that money spent on welfare reaches those who really need it."
