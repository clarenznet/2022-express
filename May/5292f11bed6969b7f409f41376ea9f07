Vitamin D may be a commonly thrown around vitamin in the winter months, but it is a potent and effective supplement with multiple useful properties. The vitamin is effective at maintaining bone strength and strengthening the immune system. As a result, it can be used to strengthen the bones as people grow older and their bones become more susceptible to fractures. However, it is possible to overdose on vitamin D; this can increase rather than reduce the likelihood of bones fracturing. Vitamin B12 also has health benefits. Found in eggs, seafood, chicken, liver, and beef, the vitamin increases the production of red blood cells and helps maintain the central nervous system. Dr Yawitz says: “Many people don’t know that after the age of 50 or so, your body may have a more difficulty time absorbing vitamin B12 from food sources. “After this age, your stomach secretes less hydrochloric acid, which is what’s responsible for helping your body separate vitamin B12 from protein in food.” Magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 are just three vitamin supplements available for purchase from a number of shops. However, it is important to be careful not to overdose and to consult with a professional before taking them. This includes checking to seek if the correct dosage is already being consumed through food. Supplements should never replace food; they should only sit alongside it as an extra means of improving overall health.
