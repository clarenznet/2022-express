"If that's you, I want to check product-by-product if you can save £100s or £1,000s by cutting the interest. He added: “With further rate rises predicted, and many lenders' default standard variable rates heading to five percent, checking if you can save by changing deals is a must-do. “You may not save as much compared to a few months back, but compared to doing nowt, switching could still help you save £1,000s."

He said: “As interest rates continue to increase, anyone buying a property will see a direct impact on the amount they can borrow. “However, a far greater impact is likely to be seen from the increase in the cost of living, as this is stopping mortgage companies lending as much as they were previously. “Lenders are having to build in the increased costs of food and fuel into their affordability calculations.”        Mr Johnson urged people to consider whether now is a good time to take out a mortgage. He added: “Buyers need to ensure not just that they can afford monthly mortgage payments and the associated bills, but that it is genuinely the best time for them to buy and not speculate on the property market. “Interest rates look set to continue to rise, so fixed rates with payment security will prevent those with mortgages suffering the impact of further fluctuations. “The property market still hasn’t seen a major slowdown, with demand still outstripping supply, but if interest rates and mortgage companies’ affordability requirements continue to increase we will ultimately see a fall in property prices.” What is happening where you live?

The Money Saving Expert founder told This Morning viewers that unless they're "very lucky", Britons are better off putting their savings into a savings account.
