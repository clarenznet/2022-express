Kate Moss and her supermodel offspring Lila Moss turned heads at the Met Gala last night as they took to the red carpet in stunning designer outfits. Lila, 19, turned heads as she put on a daring display in a jewelled sheer number which hugged her petite frame, while her supermodel mother Kate, 48, opted for a timeless black evening gown. The pair cosied up to each other while posing professionally for snaps on the red carpet. Kate had been dressed in a custom made designer gown which perfectly fit the Gilded Age theme of the night. Featuring a plunging sweetheart neckline, the model flashed a leg thanks to the slit up the front of the garment. She accentuated her ageless beauty with a face of fresh make up and a hot pink lip, while accesoring with a stunning diamond necklace and pair of earrings.
