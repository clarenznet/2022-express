Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and his wife Nicola Anne Peltz, 27, took to Instagram to share some seemingly topless snaps as they posed together. The son of David Beckham shared a close up picture of the pair posing as Nicola held the camera up to the mirror, while he kissed her cheek. Nicola and Brooklyn appeared to be topless, however the picture was cut off, covering their modesty. Brooklyn captioned the snap in view of his 13.9 million followers: "I'm so lucky to have you." Many social media users took to the post's comments to compliment the newly wedded couple and share their thoughts on their very public display of affection. Nicola replied: "I’m so lucky! I love you so much!" Thescreenshotfolder added: "Gorgeous couple. So glad you found one another." Michelle38617 commented: "Absolutely stunning couple." However, not all social media users were a fan of the couple's very public display of affection. Gordon_Liza said: "So nice to keep it private." Micheleazumi added: "It's none of my business but I feel a relationship if given some privacy, it lasts longer or else it's just love in social media opposite off cameras..." (sic) Nicola, meanwhile, also took to Instagram to share a string of five snaps of herself, showing off her giant wedding ring as well as sharing the same romantic snap as her other half. The new ring is seemingly a replacement for the £350k engagement ring that Brooklyn gifted her back in 2020, which had an emerald cut. The pair tied the knot last month on Nicola's family estate in Palm Beach Florida.
