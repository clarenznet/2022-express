Carol Vorderman, 61, unveiled her ageless appearance as she showed off her washboard abs in a tightly fitting cropped jumper. The BBC Radio Wales host also showed off her brand new cropped blonde hair while putting on a busty display. Carol took a selfie as she posed in a green cropped jumper paired with leopard print leggings. The star looked glamorous as she enhanced her hazel eyes with lashings of mascara and eyeliner. She typed: “Time to get out of exercise gear and off to Cardiff for this week's @BBCRadioWales. “Talking to @willyoung later about his wonderful new album celebrating 20 years since Pop Idol... and he hasn't looked back since.” In response, fans gushed over the TV presenters' physique. @Richard02252511 said: "Stuck in work get on Twitter and the lovely gorgeous @carolvorders has just posted photos herself made my Saturday happy Saturday everyone." @slm01merc typed: "Looking fabulous."
