The young women say they have been targeted by the man, who would sit in seats near them and watched their reactions as he played pornographic videos on his phone. Two of the six women also said that the man appeared to be, or was actively touching himself at the same time, according to the Manchester Evening News (MEN). The alleged victims connected with each other on social media, before going to the police. According to the MEN, when one of the women got on the 143 bus in Manchester, she sat two rows behind the man, with another two women sitting in front of her. She described that the man could initially be seen watching ‘fart’ porn, which seemed odd but not too explicit. He then put on more and more extreme videos and, while watching them, he was consistently looking behind him to see the women’s reactions. When the women in front of her got off the bus, the man stood up and sat in their row, right in front of her. That’s when she reportedly felt “scared” and said: “What made me more scared is that so many people have seen it. So many people have been impacted by this. “Obviously nobody on the bus consented to that [watching porn]. “He was definitely looking around to see how people were reacting. “He was getting off on the public element of it.” Another alleged victim told the MEN that during the incident she felt “shocked” and “uncomfortable”. She said: “It was funny when it started, at first we were like, surely this is not happening”. "We were laughing because we were sort of in shock, we just wanted to make a joke out of it. “And then as it just kept going, we got really uncomfortable. “We thought, he’s looking at us weird - what if he gets off at the same stop as us? It’s late at night.”
