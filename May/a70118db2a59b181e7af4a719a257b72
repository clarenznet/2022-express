"It can improve your feeling of satiety." When enjoying a Mediterranean meal, you are "less inclined to overeat". What's more, this feeling of fullness stops dieters from reaching into their cupboards and fridges for processed foods when it comes to snack time.

"If we look at fats, it doesn't have the trans fats and the fractionated oil, all that garbage, it doesn't have all those fake fats. "It's also not high in saturated fat - it's full of polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats." Healthy fats to stock up on when following a Mediterranean diet include olive oil, avocado and nuts and seeds. Seafoods that are high in Omega 3's, such as mackerel, salmon, herring and sardines, are also great for a Mediterranean diet weight loss plan. What it doesn't include is a "tonne of red meat" such as, beef, lamb and pork, or processed foods. The Mediterranean diet is "loaded with fermented foods" such as kefir, which is optimum for gut health. "It's also a diet that is very high in fibre." High-fibre veggies help the body feel full quicker, consequently meaning that people eat less and consume fewer calories. Alongside this, the world renowned diet prioritises high-quality proteins and high-quality carbs. "There is very little processed carbs or refined sugar in this diet. This means that the diet is low-inflammatory as opposed to high - which is particularly good for perimenopausal women, as perimenopause is an inflammatory event. Jillian stated that "everybody that kinda matters in health and wellness" would call the Mediterranean diet the "best" one.
