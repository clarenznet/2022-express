Antonio Rudiger has signed a pre-contract agreement with Real Madrid ahead of the end of his Chelsea contract, reports claim. Rudiger will be out of contract at Stamford Bridge at the end of the season. It was already known that Rudiger would leave the club this summer after the centre-back informed Thomas Tuchel he had no intention of staying put next season. Rudiger is out of contract at the end of the season and he had already snubbed the offer of a new deal. Instead, according to The Athletic, he will sign for Real Madrid from July 1 on a four-year deal worth a whopping £164,000 per-week. Rudiger's new contract will also have a staggering £342million release clause inserted in it. Rudiger is unlikely to be the only player walking away from Stamford Bridge this summer due to the uncertainty surrounding the club. Todd Boehly's consortium recently signed an agreement to purchase the club from Roman Abramovich, but that hasn't stopped players from looking elsewhere. Andreas Christensen is expected to follow Rudiger to La Liga and sign for Barcelona on a free this summer when his Stamford Bridge deal expires. The Danish centre-back has been urged to stay by Tuchel but it appears he has his heart set on a move to the Nou Camp to join Xavi's Barca revolution. Cesar Azpilicueta is another who has been linked with the exit door, despite signing a new one-year contract to keep him at the club until 2023. Azpilicueta, who has been at the club for a decade, has reportedly agreed terms with Barcelona ahead of a potential move this year. Rudiger's move to Madrid will reportedly be announced after the Champions League final. Madrid will take on Liverpool in the competition's showpiece final on May 28 in Paris. The German international has apparently already completed his medical ahead of the move, and will pocket a sizeable signing-on fee ahead of the move.
