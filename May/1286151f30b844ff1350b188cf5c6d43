Crippling energy price rises in 2022 have left Britons financially worse off during a countrywide cost of living surge. Rising inflation, stagnating pay growth and an adjusted price cap due to increase again in October have prompted an income raid unprecedented for decades. A support package unveiled by Rishi Sunak last week will aim to offload some of the burdens with Government coffers, starting with a £400 rebate. Among the measures promised by the Chancellor last week is a £400 energy rebate. The measure may sound familiar to some, as Mr Sunak originally proposed it in his spring budget as a £200 sum used to discount energy bills Britons would have to pay back in £40 instalments from 2023.

Ministers have earmarked the additional sum for those on Universal Credit, legacy benefits, Tax Credit and Pension Credit. Pensioners and disabled Britons can receive even more through the Government's package. The Chancellor's intervention has also set aside £300 more for pensioner households and £150 for those on disability benefits. Disability benefits in the UK include: Altogether, some people may end up entitled to £1,650 overall.
