BBC World News and BBC News will merge to create a single 24-hour channel serving both the UK and international audiences. Regional TV news in Oxford and Cambridge will also be devolved to the Southampton and Norwich operations respectively.  Speaking to staff yesterday, Director-General Mr Davie said: "This is our moment to build a digital-first BBC… "[The Government] wants us to keep the BBC relevant…We need to evolve faster and embrace huge shifts in the market around us." The first phase of cuts will total £500million in annual savings and reinvestment, £200million of which will go towards bridging the £285million annual shortfall.  The remainder of the funding gap - resulting from Culture Minister Nadine Dorries freezing the TV Licence fee at £159 for two years in January - will be covered in the years from 2024 to the end of the BBC Charter period in 2027. Mr Davie has overseen a slimming-down of the corporation since he took over from Lord Hall in September 2020 - with it losing some 1,200 staff over the last 18 months.
