On February 6, 2022, the Queen's 70th year on the throne officially commenced and a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend has been planned for the monarch this week to celebrate her long reign. Hopes are high that the Platinum Jubilee celebrations will beat the high standard set by the monarch's previous Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002 and 2012 respectively. Here are some of the best pictures of the Queen's Jubilees over the years.
