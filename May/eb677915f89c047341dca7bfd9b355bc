Foo Fighters frontman Grohl loves lairy Liam so much that he co-wrote and drums on his Everything's Electric single which mixes the feel of Beastie Boys' Sabotage with a frisky Stones riff. Fans of the warring Gallagher brothers will find plenty to love in Liam's third solo album. It delivers proper belters but takes risks too.  Our Kid, now pushing 50, opens with a children's choir on plaintive piano ballad More Power, before joining in 50 seconds later with that familiar fine whine. "I wish I had more power," he rasps. His boisterous C'mon You Know is a swaggering beauty that feels like early Oasis. The lyrics are unexpectedly upbeat. "C'mon, you know it's gonna be alright, and we're gonna dance all night," he assures us. "Get up, stand up if you feel alive" That'll get the Knebworth crowds going. "Start living, be thankful... show love," Liam advises, before the song deviates into dreamier dimensions. Once again, he's worked with Andrew Wyatt and Greg Kurstin throughout. Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner and Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig also chip in.  You can, of course, detect Beatles' DNA, along with a sliver of The Smiths, on the jaunty Diamond In The Dark. Don't Go Halfway is a menacing mid-paced groover, while piano ballad Too Good For Giving Up has traces of Elton. "The universe will provide a guiding hand," Liam promises. Hope so. On More Power, he targets "People talking like they're gods", cautioning, "But that's just not the deal, if you want to keep the things you love, then you'd better learn to kneel". Which people? Surely not someone else called Gallagher?
