A lorry and a van collided with one another on the M6 northbound, between junctions J17 and J18. Pictures show a huge gridlock of traffic following the closure of lanes 1 and 2. Emergency services attended the scene of the accident which occurred at 3.45pm. Inrix reported: "Two lanes closed and queuing traffic due to accident, a lorry and a van involved on M6 Northbound before J18 A54 Middlewich Road (Middlewich/Holmes Chapel). "Congestion to J17 (Sandbach/Crewe)." They later added the lanes had been reopened. There were understood to be delays of 40 minutes above normal journey times on the motorway. Congestion on the road stretched for six miles. The gridlocked traffic comes just as M6 commuters are warned there will be heavy congestion over the weekend as a 50-year-old bridge at junction 10 is demolished. The demolition is the latest stage of the £78million transformation of the Walsall junction. As a result, junction 10 will be closed all weekend. "The south bridge at Junction 10 of the M6 in Walsall is to be demolished this weekend, between 8pm Friday and 6am Monday. "The north bridge is expected to be removed later this month."
