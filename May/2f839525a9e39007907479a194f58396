Alister Gray, 32, is now fighting for his life in hospital after the brutal attack. The civil engineer was on his way from a bar in the early house of Saturday morning in Istanbul, Turkey, when the thieves attacked. At first, one of them tries to snatch the phone out of his hand.  Mr Gray was heading towards an underground station at 2.30am, to return to his hotel. He tried to fight back, swinging at the first hooded attacker. In the footage, another attacker then runs to join in the assault. Mr Gray then tried to flee but is chased. According to local media reports, Mr Gray suffered serious injuries to his neck and chest.  He was stabbed seven times. Mr Gray is now being treated at Okmeydani Hospital. He is said to be in a critical condition. The holidaymaker told police: “Four people tried to take my mobile phone on the street. “When I resisted, they stabbed me and took my mobile phone and ran away.” Four suspects have been identified by police using the CCTV footage. All four have previous criminal records. In a raid the next day, Enes Yoldas, Seyithan Erdem, Abdurrahman Baydak, and U.A., reportedly a minor, were arrested. Mr Gray’s fight for his life in hospital goes on as the investigation continues.
