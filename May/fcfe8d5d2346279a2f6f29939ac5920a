Gemma Atkinson, 37, took to Instagram and shared a candid snap ahead of her appearance at The Audio and Radio Industry Awards (ARIAS). The former Emmerdale star caught the attention of the Strictly Come Dancing star and fianc√© Gorka Marquez, 31, when she shared a few sultry snaps. In view of her 1.7 million followers, the mum-of-one shared a series of photos as she gave her legion of fans a glimpse of her outfit. The blonde beauty looked chic in a floor-length gown that featured a plunging neckline and a thigh-high split. Gemma styled her braided tresses which were wept into an updo as two curls hung loosely down her face. She accentuated her features with light makeup and added a rouge lip. The Hits Radio DJ teamed her stylish dress with a pair of pointed black heels. The first photo she uploaded showcased Gemma sitting in her hotel room while on a chair as she posed with her legs on display. A second snap saw her pose as she unveiled her ensemble, while a third picture was a close-up selfie that unveiled her flawless makeup. Gemma captioned the post: "All set for the Arias! (Posh radio awards) Thank you @cintalondon for dashing across London to paint my face and do my hair! What a difference from this morning's green tracksuit and nursery dash." Her other half, Gorka, was one of the first to reply, with a series of heart-eye emojis. Others also gushed over her appearance, as Claire Hartley penned: "You look stunning." Natasha added: "Gorgeous." Gemma attended the ARIAS Awards at The Adelphi Theatre in London which honours top talent in the industry.
