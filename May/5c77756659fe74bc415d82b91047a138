Priscilla Presley was the picture of elegance as she took to the red carpet at the Cannes Film festival for the screening of new film, Elvis. The film is a biographical musical film directed by Baz Luhrmann and has already received Priscilla's seal of approval.   Priscilla, 77, dazzled at the glitzy event as she donned a chocolate brown satin dress which ended just below her knees. The smooth fabric perfectly hugged her incredible curves and featured long sleeves and a square neckline. The garment featured intricate beaded patterns all over which added an element of glam to the gown. The ex-wife of singer Elvis Presley wore her flame-coloured locks swept away from her face into a ponytail. She wore a full face of makeup including a glamorous smokey eye and pink lip. Priscilla smiled and waved for snaps alongside star of the biopic, Austin Butler, 30, who donned a suit and bowtie for the occasion.
