Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia are just two debilitating conditions that may qualify - in total there are 87 conditions which qualify for PIP. However, how much a person gets is down to how the condition affects a them. This extra £627 a month in benefits could be a lifeline to those struggling during the cost of living crisis. While millions of people are struggling due to food and energy price crises, approximately £15billion is lost in unclaimed benefits every year, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Thousands of people are not claiming benefits they are entitled to including disability benefits such as PIP. PIP replaced the Disability Living Allowance in 2013 and is paid to people between 16 and state pension age who have difficulty completing everyday tasks or moving around. Depending on how badly their condition affects them, they could receive up to £627 a month from the DWP.

Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are just two conditions that are included in the full list of 87 muscle and joint conditions. People can also claim if they suffer from arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions. Some people are put off claiming because they claim the process can be time consuming and stressful. However, they can ask Citizen’s Advice or Macmillan Cancer Support for help filling out the forms.
