Material Girl singer Madonna, 63, delighted her fans last night by sharing some intriguing behind-the-scenes snaps from her latest performance with her collaborator Maluma, 28, in Medellín, Columbia.  The pop icon showed off her incredibly smooth visage in the series of pics, as she cosied up to the Columbian singer during his tour.  Madonna also teased her 18 million Instagram followers with a very busty close-up photo of her chest.  The star wore a skintight red T-shirt that was emblazoned with the word “prom”, alongside an AAA logo.  Madonna cheekily explained in the caption of the zoomed in shot that her T-shirt read “PROM not porn” alongside ice cube and teardrop emojis.  She paired the tiny top with her signature fishnet tights and black leather combat boots, alongside skimpy black shorts decorated with a lace pattern.  Madonna went on to show off her close relationship with Maluma, as she posed with her fellow songwriter with her arms wrapped around him.  The star also shared a cryptic message about broken hearts, following her recent split from 28-year-old dancer Ahlamalik Williams.  Maluma tilted Maluma’s head forward to the camera to display a broken-heart shape that had been buzzed into his haircut in bright red.  Madonna captioned the photo: “Broken hearts can learn to fly,” alongside three broken heart emojis.
