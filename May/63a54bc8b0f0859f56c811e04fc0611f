Demi Rose, 27, left little to the imagination as she posed on a sunbed on holiday in Palm Springs. The model shared a string of three snaps of herself posing while soaking up the sun. In the first snap, Demi can be seen looking away from the camera as she lays on the green and white sunbed with her legs up and arms on the rests. Her barely-there green underwired bikini top met on one shoulder, leaving Demi's ample assets on full display. The bikini bottoms featured a similar cut-out, showcasing her curvaceous figure. In the next snap, Demi posed for a closeup as she sat up, pulling her bikini bottoms higher, showcasing her enviable curves. The final snap showed more of the glamorous landscape as well as the model sunbathing. The signature brunette tresses were worn straight, as she went for minimal makeup, only wearing mascara. She captioned the post in view of her 19.4 Instagram million followers: "Summer is that you?"
