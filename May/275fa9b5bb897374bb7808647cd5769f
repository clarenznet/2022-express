The brother of David Haines, a British aid worker killed by an Islamic State cell known as 'the Beatles' said the conviction of one of their members had closed “an eight-year chapter of pain” for his family. Mike appeared on Monday's Good Morning Britain, where he told Kate Garraway and Richard Madeley how he told his brother's killer he forgives him in order to stop "the spread of hate". ITV viewers blasted the pair as being "rude" during the emotional conversation, in which Mike became choked up whilst talking about the impact on his parents. "I tried to think 'What was his murder about?'" revealed Mike. "It wasn't because he was white, it wasn't because he was Christian, it wasn't because he was a humanitarian. "He was nothing to them, and then it hit me, it really was an epiphany moment, that they wanted me to hate - to spread hate. "It hit me again that all terror attacks are about the spread of hate and I knew I had to do something against the spread of hate.

"My mum, right the way through the whole process, from when he was taken to when he was murdered, was incredibly strong," Mike recalled tearfully. "And my dad was a great support for me personally as the liaison between the government agencies acted and the family. "When David was murdered, my mum slowly gave up on life and slowly faded away until her death." DON'T MISS...

Twitter users flooded social media with comments about the interview, with @LukeHayesII1 writing: "Talk about rubbing it in Kate ffs #GMB." @hooray_k fumed: "#GMB #GoodMorningBritain #MikeHaines #DavidHaines Poor family must have been through hell. Now they have to endure torture of  a fake empathy, ill-educated & cringe interview with the buffoons, #KateGarraway & #RichardMadeley." @hooray_k penned: " #GMB #GoodMorningBritain #KateGarraway Clumsy & Gobby Garraway again fails to understand basic concept of interview to ask question then wait for an answer.  Not, ask question then shout over interviewee with further question or drown out by saying “Mmm” loudly. Embarrassing." (sic) "Jeez could Kate have looked any more uninterested during that interview? She wasn’t even looking at him she had her head turned away from him. Very rude #gmb #goodmorningbritain," @FlopsyPickle commented. @bestchester276 addeD: "Kates got a new way to be even more annoying, when interviewing that wonderful man all I could hear was mmm, mmm, #GMB," (sic) @pippygro shared: "Madeley loves a bit of bloodthirsty hyperbole #gmb." Meanwhile, @MandyMae737 wrote: "What an amazing man is Mike Haines.....heartbreaking to hear his story. His forgiveness is  incredible. A credit to the human race and moreover the brother he clearly loves and mourns. God Bless him #gmb." Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.
