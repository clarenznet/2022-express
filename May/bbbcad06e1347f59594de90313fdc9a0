"But somehow he has forced himself into a corner where he has no choice but to resign himself if he is fined.And he thinks that will give him the moral high ground. What he and his Labour colleagues don't get is that most people don't care about Partygate or Beergate - but they do care about rank hypocrisy and that's why he has to go. I do hope that the Tory position is to continue to deal with important matters and that Starmer can please himself what he does".  "Through his continued harassment of the PM, Sir Keir Starmer now appears to have made a rod for his own back", says Malcolm Seddon from Barnsley, SYorks. "The man has no idea how politics works. He must learn that by opening his mouth without engaging his brain he can quite quickly get into trouble". "I'm sure many Labour supporters would be delighted if Sir Keir Starmer were to stand down as it would give them a better chance of success in any future election", says Michael Carter from Rickmansworth, Herts. " If Sir Keir Starmer is forced to resign over Beergate and Boris fails to resign over Partygate then the law is an ass and justice is a joke", says Simon Gladdish from Swansea. "What a magnificent Queen's Speech on behalf of Boris Johnson and his Government", says Geoffrey Brooking from Havant, Hants. "While Labour does its best to waste Parliamentary time on Partygate the Conservatives continue to work hard for the British people". "Well done Boris, your back to basics Queen's Speech is just what's needed to get our nation back on track ("PM: I'll strive night and day to 'level up' Britain", May 10)", says Roy Daniels from Luton, Beds. "Exploiting Brexit, jailing ecovandals, clamping down on illegal migration and the lawyers who defend them, and getting more children into good education is music to the ears of most voters. "Expect loud cheers from the ex-Labour red wall voters and the rest of us in the real world".
