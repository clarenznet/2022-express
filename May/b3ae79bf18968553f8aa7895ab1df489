 Their love of the sport was once something that brought him and William closer together, allowing them to make money for their favoured charities each summer at benefit matches in the Cotswold countryside. But the sight of Harry, 37, playing at the exclusive Santa Barbara Polo & Racquet Club in Carpinteria, a 10-minute drive from his home in Montecito, only served to highlight yesterday the different path he has chosen from his elder brother, William, who was in Abu Dhabi with world leaders. William has spent the past few days focusing on a life of duty and public service representing their grandmother the Queen. Last week among other duties, he stood in for the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament, undertook engagements in Manchester, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, and travelled to present a Damehood to brave bowel cancer patient Deborah James as she received end-of-life care. Harry, who quit royal duties in March 2020 for a life of making money using his royal name, has signed up for a summer season of polo playing with the Los Padres team of his friend Nacho Figueras. He was listed as H Wales in the match on Saturday. His involvement may still raise money for good causes. When he announced Harry’s involvement, Figueras said: “My polo team has a platform where we use the sport and the platform to raise awareness for charities. Harry’s going to be a part of this team.” Harry’s wife Meghan, 40, turned out to see him play but there was no sign of their children, Archie. three and 11-month-old Lilibet, who will travel to England to meet their Windsor in-laws in less than three weeks to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.
