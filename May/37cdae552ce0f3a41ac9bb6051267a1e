The Duke of Sussex's charity, called Sentebale, was set up to help orphaned African children. The charity's accounts show that it has seen a multimillion pound income. The charity, called Sentebale, was co-founded by the Prince in 2006.  However, over the past two years, the organisation claimed almost £20,000 of taxpayers’ money. According to the Daily Mail, newly released accounts disclose that Sentebale claimed £5,000 from the Government’s Job Retention scheme last year, on top of £14,000 in 2020. The claim was made even though the charity boasted an income of £3.1 million in the 12 months to last August.
