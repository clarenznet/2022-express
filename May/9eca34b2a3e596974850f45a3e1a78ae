Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has argued that by announcing the opening of the new Elizabeth tube line the day before the local elections, Mayor of London Mr Khan breached election rules. Mr Shapps added that he will be referring the "breach" to the Electoral Commission for investigation. He said: "This announcement is an act of breathtaking political cynicism by the Mayor, breaking election rules on such announcements in an effort to garner votes the day before the local elections in London. "I am therefore immediately referring this breach to the Electoral Commission for investigation. "Londoners reading this unscrupulous headline grab might like to know that the Government has poured billions into Crossrail to solve delays clocked up on the Mayor's watch, while propping up a transport system hobbled financially by his chronic incompetence."
