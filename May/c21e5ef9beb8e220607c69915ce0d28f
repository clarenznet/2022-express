  Rylan Clark has confessed he "completely lost six months of his life" after separating from his ex husband Dan Neal, in an interview with Express.co.uk. The Strictly: It Takes Two star, who is set to oversee Eurovision coverage for the UK this year, opened up about the tough time he experienced when his marriage ended after six years.     Rylan, 33, opened up to Express.co.uk about his marriage at the Boots No7 Pro Derm scan launch party last month. The Eurovision presenter had a very public split from husband Dan last year. When the pair parted ways, the star admitted that he had become very ill and lost weight, retreating from the spotlight for months due to his health struggles. Quizzed about that period, the presenter gave an honest insight into how he had been feeling.

In the interview, Rylan also suggested that his honesty under the public eye has helped him keep his career going, although being under the spotlight has sometimes been tough on his mental health. Speaking about his knack for being open with the public, Rylan said: “I think that's part of why I'm still here 10 years on. “I've always been honest. I've been honest with the public, I've been honest with my family, I’ve been honest with my relationship.     “I have had a lot of support from the public,” he added. “It was also one of the things that contributed to me not feeling great, being who I was. “And then being put in a position to say something that wasn't necessarily true, being so ill.” However, it seems since that time, Rylan is feeling more positive about his future.
