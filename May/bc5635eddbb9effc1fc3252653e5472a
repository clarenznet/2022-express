Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has told the Gunners that they made a mistake in sacking his replacement Unai Emery after the Spaniard came close to leading Villarreal to an unlikely Champions League final. The Yellow Submarine had already scalped Juventus and Bayern Munich in the knockout rounds before a tie against English giants Liverpool awaited.
