Amanda Holden, 51, showed off her impossibly toned legs in a summery floral dress today. The Britain’s Got Talent judge took to Instagram to reveal her outfit to her 1.8 million followers, as she revealed she was “loving this frock”. In a Boomerang post, Amanda could be seen giving the camera a fierce look as she strutted towards it. The presenter put her long legs on display in a floral dress in orange and pink tones. She paired the frock with some hot pink and orange ombré stiletto heels, while keeping her hair casual with some waves that fell either side of her face. Amanda also took to her Story to share a picture of herself trying the official pudding for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. She later shared some more pictures contorting as she posed and showed off her colourful outfit.
