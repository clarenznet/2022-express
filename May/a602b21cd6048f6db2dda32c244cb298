Royal author Howard Hodgson believes that if the Duke of Sussex makes up with the Royal Family he may want to make a royal comeback in Britain. His opinion comes as Harry and Meghan, who are living in California after quitting the Firm in 2020, are set to travel to the UK for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Mr Hodgson told the Sun: "I don’t think Meghan wants it to be repaired, because if it was repaired, that might get Harry wanting to come back and play his role. "In a way, Prince Charles doesn’t want any focus going in that direction, he wants a straight-line focus on him, William, George.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
