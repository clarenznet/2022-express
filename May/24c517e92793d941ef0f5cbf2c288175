Who will be crowned “Kings of Europe” in Paris? It’s Liverpool v Real Madrid in the Champions League final. We’ve teamed up with William Hill to give you a £2 free bet to stake on the game in their shops. The two sides met in the 2018 final, with Madrid coming out on top thanks to Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale. That was Real’s last European crown. Can they lift a 14th? Victory for Liverpool would see them join AC Milan on seven titles and lift the famous trophy for a second time under Jurgen Klopp. Mohamed Salah and Karim Benzema could prove crucial for their sides. Salah has scored 31 goals in all competitions this season. Benzema is the leading scorer in the 2021/22 Champions League (15). So don't miss out, pick up your Daily Express this weekend (May 28) where you'll find a voucher for the free bet to use at your local William Hill shop.
