New Chelsea owner Todd Boehly looked far from impressed at the final whistle in the match against Wolves after visiting Stamford Bridge for his first game since his takeover was confirmed. The Blues appeared to be heading for a straight-forward 2-0 win after Romelu Lukaku scored twice.

And Conor Coady scored with the last kick of the game to send the Wolves fans crazy behind the goal. Cameras quickly panned to Boehly in the stands with his head slumped into his hands.
