Luran, a five-and-a-half-year-old ex-racing greyhound, came into the care of Blue Cross Southampton in August 2021. But she is still waiting to be picked by adopters as her one-year anniversary approaches. Luran loves a fuss and will rest her head in your lap to be stroked. She is on ongoing pain medication due to a shoulder injury from her racing past which her new owners will need to continue. The ex-racing greyhound is looking for a home where she is the only pet.
