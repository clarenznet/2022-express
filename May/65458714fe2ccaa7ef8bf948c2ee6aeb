Maddie Thomas, who had been missing since April 26, was found by police at 12.45pm today. Three men at the address have been arrested and remain in police custody. Both Maddie’s foster parents and family have been informed. Detective Inspector Laura Miller said that the 15-year-old is being provided "with all the care and support she needs". She said: "We’re delighted to confirm Maddie has been found. "Three men are in police custody and will soon be questioned by officers. "We’re extremely grateful for all the support the public gave us in our search for Maddie and would like to reassure them she is now being provided with all the care and support she needs. "We appreciate there is significant interest in this case and I’d ask people not to speculate and to think about the impact it may have on Maddie and her loved ones." Yesterday, Avon and Somerset Police announced that they were "no longer investigating Maddie's disappearance as a missing person case but as a child abduction". Enquiries are ongoing.
