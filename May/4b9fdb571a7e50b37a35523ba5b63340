Liverpool take on Real Madrid in the Champions League looking to win their seventh major European honour. Express Sport brings you all the live updates from Paris as Jurgen Klopp looks to lead his team to glory and complete a cup treble.  However, the German coach fears Real will head into the tie as the favourites. “If you look at the history of the club, the experience of the other team if you look at the way Real Madrid celebrated comebacks (this season) then I would say from my point of view that Real Madrid is the favourite,” he said. “But actually I want us to be on the same level, these kinds of things. Thinking we are at the same level. I want us to completely be ourselves in this game. If we are on the top of our game we are difficult to play, really difficult to play, and that is my only concern at the moment: that we be ourselves and be really confident as well. “But of course the confidence level of the Madrid players is incredibly high. It would mean a lot to win. The world we are living in means we get judged by the final result but if you are a football person then you know what my boys did this season so far is absolutely exceptional. “But of course in the end it is all measured by the colour of the medal you get after a game. We are ready for that. History will tell us what people say about us. I am really happy with what we did so far.”  Follow Express Sport's live updates below.
