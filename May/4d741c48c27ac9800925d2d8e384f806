Jennifer Connolly, 51, showcased her ageless beauty as she posed for photographers at the London premiere of Top Gun: Maverick. The actress looked phenomenal in a show-stopping cream gown with black embroidery. The maxi dress featured a black belt that chinched Jennifer’s waist, while the flow sleeves gave the outfit an ethereal look. Jennifer wore her black hair down and it was styled in retro waves and a side parting. The actress, who was joined by co-star Tom Cruise, 59, plays Penny Benjamin in the follow-up to the hit 1980s film Top Gun: Maverick. Tom looked dapper in a classic black tuxedo at the event’s red carpet, which takes place tonight in London’s Leicester Square. The original Top Gun film has grossed more than £289.5 million worldwide.
