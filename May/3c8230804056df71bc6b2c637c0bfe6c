"Peekaboo!" the sensational star teased, as fans were treated to a tantalising glimpse of her lingerie look. Sweeping her hair in front of one eye, the 52-year-old actress looked mysterious and sophisticated. Catherine, who is married to Michael Douglas, 77, also took to social media this week to share the mutual appreciation between herself and her children for Mother's Day. She shared black and white vintage styled shots of herself with her daughter Carys and son Dylan, as well as a photo with mother Patricia Fair. The actress captioned the insightful shots: "Happy Mother’s Day, to all mothers, and stepmothers and foster mothers and grandmothers and all who have the joy in life to love and protect children." Her stepson Cameron, Michael's child with ex-wife Diandra Luker, reciprocated her affection, chiming in: "Amen to that! and thank you for being such a great stepmother and ZeeZee to my kids and I ♥️ We Love you @catherinezetajones." Cameron had previously spoken to the Daily Mail about the close bond shared between the pair, explaining: "You hear stories all the time about the stepmother pushing away the kids from a previous marriage", before insisting that hadn't happened in his case. Meanwhile Catherine's biological son Dylan joined in on the praise, posting his own photo of himself with his mum and captioning it: "Happy Mother’s Day to all!!! Especially my mother !!! I love you very much."
