A study of children aged four and five found parents and schools felt pupils were disadvantaged in social and emotional wellbeing, language and numeracy skills when entering reception classes in 2020. The proportion of pupils reaching expected levels in all areas was 59 percent in 2021, compared with 72 percent for 2019. This equates to three more children in every classroom not reaching expected levels by the end of the school year. The study was commissioned by the Education Endowment Foundation. Chief executive Becky Francis said: "The early years are such a crucial time for development. "It is particularly concerning fewer children reached the expected levels of development by the end of reception class."
