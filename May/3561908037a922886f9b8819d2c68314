Police pulled over the vehicle on Saturday afternoon on the A30 near Bodmin, Cornwall. Devon and Cornwall Police shared details about the irresponsible behaviour on one of its Twitter pages. The force posted: "Vehicle stopped #A30 #InnisDowns - two children on the laps of adults in the rear of the car - driver reported and alternative transport sorted for the adults #NoExcuse." Cars should not carry more than the number of people it’s designed for, including the driver as it’s dangerous and could put your insurance cover at risk. Many insurers exclude claims caused by a vehicle carrying passengers unsafely or illegally, reports Cornwall Live. By law, every person in the car, no matter how old, must have a properly fitted seatbelt or child seat in order to set off on your journey lawfully. If you have an accident while carrying more people than your car is designed for or they’re seated somewhere other than a car seat, then you risk having your claim repudiated and are putting lives at risk. It comes as motorists are being warned of major new driving law changes in June, which some experts have warned could lead to an "avalanche of fines". For example, councils across England and Wales will be given new powers to charge drivers for traffic offences. And in addition to the new electric vehicle chargers, any homes and businesses which have existing EV chargers will be required to ensure they have smart charging capabilities.
