Denise Van Outen, 47, cut a stylish figure as she attended the Top Gun London premiere this evening. The Celebrity Gogglebox star stunned in a long sleeved maroon velvet dress. The dress featured a high neck along with a creased velvet pattern meeting in the middle. This left the television personality's toned pins on display, showing off her petite figure. Denise looked bronze as she posed in Leicester Square for the long awaited Top Gun: Maverick film. She accompanied the dress with butterfly stamped heels, and silver dangle earrings. Her signature blonde tresses were straight and kept behind her ears, falling effortlessly down her back, not to distract from the dress. Top Gun: Maverick is a follow up to the hit 1980s film, with Tom reprising his role as Pete "Maverick" Mitchell. Yesterday, the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where Tom and his co-star Jennifer Connelly, who plays Penny Benjamin, walked the red carpet.
