  Jodie Whittaker was spotted cradling her bundle of joy in some new pictures, which revealed she had given birth to her second baby. The Doctor Who actress, who had not announced the birth prior to being spotted with the little one in London, was beaming as she snuggled her newborn, whom she shares with her husband Christian Contreras.     Jodie, 39, was spotted out and about with her other half Christian, as the pair met up with The Crown actor Claire Foy. The BBC actress was seen grinning with her adorable newborn strapped to her in a papoose. Jodie keeps her family life quite private and did not choose to officially announce her second child’s arrival. Christian and Jodie first welcomed a daughter back in 2015, whom they keep out of the spotlight.

Jodie rose to fame on mainstream television when she appeared as grieving mother Beth Latimer in critically acclaimed ITV drama Broadchurch in 2013. In 2017, the BBC announced the actress as the first woman to play the iconic role of the Doctor in classic sci-fi show Doctor Who. Jodie played the thirteenth incarnation of the character, taking over from The Thick of It actor Peter Capaldi.      The BBC have since announced Ncuti Gatwa as Jodie’s replacement in the legendary role. The actor was previously best known for playing Eric in Netflix’s hit show Sex Education, but it seems that even bigger things are on the star’s horizon. Iconic screenwriter Russell T. Davies will be taking the reins from showrunner Chris Chibnall for the new series of the popular sci-fi show. Russell was responsible for the 2005 revival of Doctor Who after the show was cancelled in the 1980s, and has recently won critical acclaim for his Channel 4 show It's a Sin.
