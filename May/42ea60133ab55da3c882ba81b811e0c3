Loose Women star Denise Welch, 64, was all smiles as she dressed to impress in a plunging pink swimsuit for her Grecian holiday. Telling her 363,000 Instagram fans that her husband had whisked her away as part of a "birthday treat", the Hollyoaks actress could scarcely contain her delight. Denise paired her sensational swimwear with a bright orange cover-up as part of a clashing colours ensemble. The star accessorised with a splash of crimson red lipstick and a pair of white platform heels. Fans marvelled at her age-defying voluptuous figure, as she told them that she was having a "wonderful time" on her adventures abroad. However, Greece is not the only sun-drenched location she has touched down in recently. She recently jetted to LA as part of her Loose Women role, causing a string of controversial comments from social media followers querying who financed the trip. However she hit back at one, quipping: "You might want to change your Twitter handle."
