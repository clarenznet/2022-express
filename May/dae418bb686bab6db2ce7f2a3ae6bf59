The University of Glasgow’s Professor Naveed Sattar was sceptical of the research, believing they overestimated the impact of reduced TV screen time on heart disease risk. Professor Sattar said: “There is abundant other evidence that increasing activity time by replacing time spent sitting help slower body fat levels and prevents weight gain, improves blood pressure and blood fat levels, and lowers diabetes risks. “All such improvements, in turn, are known to lessen heart attack and stroke risks.” It’s not so much that watching TV increases heart disease risk, but rather the subsequent lack of activity that raises the risk. Meanwhile, one of the major risk factors for heart disease is high blood pressure. Among other causes, stress can be a major contributor to blood pressure as it causes the release of the hormone cortisol. New research suggests one way of reducing levels of stress and the risk of heart disease is a hug. Data published in the journal PLOS One suggests people who received a hug saw their cortisol levels drop. As well as increasing blood pressure, cortisol can also have an impact on memory recall and the ability to do certain tasks. The act of a hug from a loved one releases oxytocin, lowering cortisol levels. However, there was one caveat to the study. Just women, not men, saw their cortisol levels drop after a hug.
