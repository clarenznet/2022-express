To keep with tradition, designers took the sprig of myrtle from the same plant that was used for the Queen’s bouquet when she married Prince Philip. While the bouquet looked simple without detracting attention from the bride or her dress, the floral arrangement was quite meticulous. In fact, each flower was specifically chosen for its symbolism. Reports reveal that each stem of Lily of the Valley had to be hard-wired to create the finished look.  Buckingham Palace noted the arrangement drew "on the traditions of flowers of significance for the Royal Family, the Middleton family and on the Language of Flowers”. Lily of the Valley “is often used by brides as it signifies purity”, the experts said. The “future Queen Consort also chose hyacinths which represent steady love”. In addition to Lily of the Valley and Hyacinths, Kate’s bouquet contained ivy which is said to symbolise “fidelity and friendship”.  As for Sweet William, this flower choice is said to be a nod to her husband. Finally, the myrtle is seen as “the emblem of matrimony”. After saying her vows, the Duchess followed the tradition started by the Queen Mother. Members of the public witnessed her laying flowers on The Grave of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.
