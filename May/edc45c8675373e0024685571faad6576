During lockdown, a number of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) were imposed across Britain. The zones block traffic from certain areas and require motorists to pay for adjustments, which make their vehicles more eco-compliant. Some embattled Britons have labelled the schemes as a ‘war on cars’, and questioned their introduction.  London Mayor Sadiq Khan sparked the most recent development, after launching a consultation into whether to expand the capital’s 'ultra-low emission zone' (ULEZ). The move would see the entirety of greater London covered by the zone from August 2023. Residents already feeling the pinch from the cost of living crisis could soon be asked to find extra cash, just to keep their vehicles on the road. Do you agree that the schemes are needed to reduce traffic in busy towns and cities? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
