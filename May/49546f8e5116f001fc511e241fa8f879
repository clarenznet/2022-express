Government plans to widen the ban on exclusivity clauses, which have previously restricted staff from working for multiple employers, have been given the green light. The plans will allow Britain’s lowest-paid workers to boost their income by taking on extra work. One and a half million low paid workers who are earning £123 a week or less will be able to boost their earnings by taking on more work. The Government has announced reforms which will give workers more flexibility over when and where they work. The news comes after the government previously announced measures to help those struggling with the rising cost of living crisis, including increasing the National Living Wage to £9.50 per hour, Manchester Evening News reports. It follows a consultation launched in December 2020, which sought views on extending the ban on exclusivity clauses beyond zero hours contracts.

People earning between £184 and £967 a week have to pay NI but not everyone has to pay the same.

He said: “Alongside the inflation and the rising costs of utility bills, the new tax will impact even further the pockets of millions of workers across the UK.” However not everyone will be worse off and ‘average’ earners could actually be better off. Mr Smith added: “Employees who earn less than £34,000 per year will actually pay less National Insurance than they did prior to April 2022. He continued: “In this respect, for instance, a worker with a £20,000 annual salary will save £178 on their National Insurance between April 2022 and April 2023. “If an employee earns £30,000 per year, they will pay £53 less than they did the last year.” At the other end of the scale, people who earn more than £34,000 per year will end up paying more NI than they used to. Somebody on a £50,000 yearly wage will pay an extra £197, whereas those on a £100,000 annual pay will see their National Insurance increase by £822. What is happening where you live?
