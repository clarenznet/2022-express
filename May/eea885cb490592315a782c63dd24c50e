Bella Hadid, 25, was spotted out and about in New York City as the model sported an all-black ensemble on Sunday ahead of the Met Gala 2022. The model looked casual chic as she rocked a '90s-style low-rise leather pants. The Victoria's Secrets model showed off her slim and svelte figure when she left her apartment and later took pictures with fans. The beauty was clad in low-cut baggy leather pants and a cropped black sweater. The runway regular's top was ribbed and she pulled the sleeves up to her elbows at one point. The stylish piece was designed with a cut-out V-shape as she flashed the flesh and put her taut abs on full display. She teamed her look with baggy leather pants as she flashed the strings of her underwear that sat on her hips. She accessorised with a double-looped gold and pearl Chanel necklace, thin oval sunglasses, and a black handbag with a long chain. She completed the look with square-toe, patent-leather booties and a throwback-style updo. The model and her sister Gigi Hadid are reportedly attending the Met Gala which is being held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art later today.
