Ronnie O'Sullivan pocketed a cool £500,000 in prize money after defeating Judd Trump to win his seventh World Snooker Championship. O'Sullivan beat Trump 18-13 in the final, drawing level with Stephen Hendry for the most world title wins. And O'Sullivan has revealed he plans to spend some of his winnings on a rigid inflatable boat, with the 46-year-old set to travel to the Lake District with his family. He said: "I'm going to do loads of stuff, I'm going to travel. I might go to the Lake District, I've already got like a house boat up there but I might go and buy a little RIB and explore the lake and just have some fun. "I'm just going to be enjoying myself and getting fit as well." O'Sullivan also made it clear he has no intention of retiring anytime soon, praising the work sports psychiatrist Steve Peters has done with him. JUST IN: Ronnie O'Sullivan's cousin says family 'broke down' watching final O'Sullivan came close to quitting the sport in 2011, but Peters prevented him from calling it a day and the 'Rocket' has won four of his seven world titles since since Peters' inervention. "If it hadn't have been for Steve Peters I would probably be in some hot country like Portugal living in a nice beach house and coming to the UK once every six weeks to see my family," he added. "The size of winning the seventh title and the enormity of it is so important to everybody - and I can feel that. But I don't consider myself the greatest ever at all. O'Sullivan also said he would like to win two more world titles before calling time on his career, adding: "If I can get another two world titles out, that would be great, but I just like playing. I enjoy work away from snooker and I’m not all-in with snooker now."I became all-in this week, I was emotionally involved. For most of the year it’s like a holiday, win or lose, it didn’t matter, but this was a different beast and I found it difficult to go into the pit again."
