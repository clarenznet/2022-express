A team of 10 sand artists worked with palaeontologists to design the prints, and spent more than four hours creating the 50-metre-long prehistoric trail. The installation, which brought the Pembrokeshire beach back to the Late Cretaceous era, was created to mark the launch of the Apple TV+ series Prehistoric Planet today (May 23rd), which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough and features music composed by Hans Zimmer. Local passer-by Anna Hatton, aged 72, said: “I saw these giant footprints from up on the cliff path and came down to take a look. It’s amazing how big they are up close.” Sir David Attenborough said: “It’s an opportunity to see the world’s most famous dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops come to life, but also to really enter into their world and see the incredible diversity of life which existed at that time.” Executive Producer, Mike Gunton, added: “We wanted to find a showstopping way to get people talking about the release of Prehistoric Planet – and what better way than bringing dinosaurs back to the present day.” ABOUT THE T REX:
