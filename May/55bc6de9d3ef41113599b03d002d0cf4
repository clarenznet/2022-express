Charges usually rise in line with inflation each year, but Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he was taking action to help people facing soaring bills. Mr Javid said: “The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. Whilst we can’t completely prevent these rises, where we can help - we absolutely will. “This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people’s pockets.” Prescriptions will remain at £9.35 for a single charge or £30.25 for a 3-month prescription prepayment certificate. 12 month payment certificates will remain at £108.10 and can be paid for in installments, meaning patients can get all the medicines they need for just over £2 a week. In addition to the freeze on charges, the NHS Low Income scheme offers free prescriptions for eligible people including many pensioners, students, and those who receive state benefits or live in care homes. The prescription freeze will also apply to NHS wigs and fabric supports. The government says it is working to tackle record waiting lists for treatment following the Covid pandemic, including providing an additional £39 billion for health and social care services. The NHS is opening new surgical hubs and 160 community diagnostic centres. The number of people waiting for surgery or other procedures in hospitals rose to almost 6.4 million at the end of March, official figures show.
