He looked the epitome of elegance as he sported a black tailcoat and grey suit. The presenter could be seen in pictures following the ceremony holding up his MBE in the grounds of the castle. Other pictures showed the moment The Prince of Wales handed him his MBE and the pair shaking hands. Jay, who left school at 15, has set up a charity to help young people who struggle in education to partake in practical jobs.
