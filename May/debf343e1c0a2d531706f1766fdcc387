Countdown legend Carol Vorderman stole the show as she rocked a flight suit for the Top Gun: Maverick premiere in London on Thursday evening. The 61-year-old stunned in a khaki jumpsuit that hugged the presenter's famous curves at the star-studded event. The beauty had previously hinted she had planned to rock her Top Gun pilot suit for the film's London premiere and the age-defying beauty did not disappoint. The mathematician almost spilled out of the low-cut jumpsuit as she left the top buttons undone. Carol accessorised the outfit with a black belt that cinched her tiny waist. She teamed her look with a pair of heeled boots which elongated her long legs. The on-screen star posed for pictures wearing aviator sunglasses and later placed them on her outfit. Carol's blonde tresses were curled in loose waves as she sported bold makeup to accentuate her stunning features. Tonight, Tom Cruise’s latest Top Gun film premieres in London’s Leicester Square. Top Gun: Maverick is a follow up to the hit 1980s film, with Tom reprising his role as Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.
