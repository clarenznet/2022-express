Madonna, 63, looked very smooth-faced as she attended the Davis vs Romero fight event for the WBA World Lightweight Championship at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Saturday. The singer, 63, hid her eyes behind a pair of pink sunglasses and wore a black Balenciaga jacket to the fight. She accessorised with several silver necklaces, and styled her blonde tresses poker straight. The hitmaker was accompanied by her 16-year-old son David Banda, who cut a stylish figure in a red v-neck top. Madonna's outing comes as she was banned from going live on Instagram after continually breaking the app's rules with her nude posts, last week. The singer expressed her outrage after discovering she was unable to broadcast live to her 18 million followers for "going against Community Guidelines" on the app, with a later message reminding users not to "spam" or "post nudity".
