The Prime Minister was seen heading to the polling station this morning to vote in the local elections. Unlike his Labour counterpart, Mr Johnson was not accompanied by his wife, which has drawn ridicule on social media. Alastair Campbell said: "I’m guessing Carrie has a postal vote so she doesn’t have to be seen with him. And I bet she didn’t show it to him either." Meanwhile, Twitter user @JoyceJoyce500 commented: "Hey Johnsonski Where's Carrie Antoinette? Mr & Mrs Starmer were out, arm in arm voting. You took Dylan the dog!!! You showed true leadership with him as he pulled in all directions. Can't even control a dog for f**k sake." Polling stations will be open until 10pm tonight. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
