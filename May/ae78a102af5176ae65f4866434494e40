Mr Ross has started today's session of First Minister's Questions (FMQs) by grilling Ms Sturgeon over her government's handling of the Ferguson ferries scandal. The Scottish Tory leader told Holyrood that the SNP had done "such a poor job of redacting the documents, that if you copy and paste them into Microsoft Word, the information is revealed". Mr Ross continued: "In one section of the redacted document, it warns of a risk of legal challenge for this contract. It states that the impact of a successful legal challenge could be high. In the worst case the contract could be declared ineffective. In other words, going ahead with this contract was such a bad idea that it could open up the government to even more losses than they've already experienced. First Minister is clear to everyone now, why you and your government wanted that redacted but it's now in the public domain." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
