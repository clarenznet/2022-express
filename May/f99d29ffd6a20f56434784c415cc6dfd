A freight train has smashed into a passenger train after derailing while coming into Sant Boi station in Catalonia, Spain. The Catalonian Medical Emergency System confirmed that the driver has died. Meanwhile two people are reportedly seriously injured, and have been transferred to the nearby Moisès Broggi Hospital. At least 85 were injured in the disaster in total. The emergency services are at the scene, including doctors and two helicopters. Images shared online depict the trains crumpled after the fatal collision, while onlookers gather. Ten fire brigade crews are currently evacuating the roughly one hundred people still trapped inside the train. The Ferrocarrils de la Generalitatis is investigating the cause of the accident.  The freight train was reportedly carrying potash - a name given to minerals containing potassium. It derailed at the entrance of Sant Boi station, colliding with the cabin of a passenerge train leaving the station at the same time. The incident occurred at around 6pm, between the stations of Sant Boi and Molí Nou.  The Catalan Railway Emergency Plan (Ferrocat) has been activated in response. Madrid Councillor Marta Higueras tweeted: "The news that reaches us from Sant Boi is terrible. "My condolences to the family and colleagues of the driver who has died and the wish for a speedy recovery to those injured in the accident."  An alternative road service is being managed between Cornellà and Colònia Güell. For the Llobregat-Anoia line there is a service between the stations of Pl. Spain and Cornellà, and between Colònia Güell and Igualada and Manresa.
