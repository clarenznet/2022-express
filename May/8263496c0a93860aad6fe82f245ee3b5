A court yesterday dismissed 115 officers who had refused to be deployed to Ukraine, making them appear to be the largest individual group to refuse to engage in Putin’s war. This forms the first official ruling against internal staff amid widespread reports of dissatisfaction with the war among Putin’s men. The Kremlin has never formally declared war in Ukraine or imposed martial law. The Russian tyrant has maintained the invasion is merely a “special military operation” to cleanse Ukraine of Nazis. As a result, Russia cannot legally send conscripts or force anyone to go and fight in Ukraine. The Russian National Guard is a domestic security agency that operates separately to the armed forces. This appears to be the largest group of officers to refuse to be involved in the war. The court bizarrely claimed that the decision made by the officers was “arbitrary”, likely in an effort to downplay the many reasons a Russian would not want to be involved in Putin’s violent war. The court, based in the Kabardino-Balkaria region, ruled yesterday the guardsmen had “arbitrarily refused to perform an official assignment”. The court again repeated the propaganda line that the war is merely a “special military operation” and not an invasion of a sovereign nation. The men appealed against losing their jobs for their decision, which appeared to be a legal one. However, the ruling, posted on the court’s website, said the men were guilty of “flagrant violations”. The hearing was held behind closed doors for reasons of “military secrecy”. Due to Russia not officially being in a state of war, the objectors cannot be prosecuted for refusing to take part, and are not the first to make the decision at the expense of their jobs.
