Queen and Adam Lambert begin their UK and European Rhapsody tour after two long years of delays with two nights in the Northern Ireland capital this Friday and Saturday nights. Brian May, Roger Taylor and the singer will then perform in Manchester and Glasgow before heading to London for their Platinum Jubilee concert opening at Buckingham Palace and the start of their 10-night residency at The O2 and beyond. Not holding back his excitement, Brian May shared a Queen and Adam Lambert “Welcome back to The SEE Arena Belfast” sign, as the band gear up for tomorrow’s opening show. The 74-year-old captioned his post: “Wow ! Having to pinch myself … YES !!! This is really happening ! QAL are back on the road !!! Hello Beautiful Belfast !!! Bri." Roger also shared a snap of his drum kit with his face on, set up on the stage ready to go. The 72-year-old enthused: “She’s ready! Belfast…. Are you? Tomorrow – we begin and we can’t wait.” In a backstage video tease Brian captioned: "So …. without giving too much away …. Here we are, in the arena, running key pieces of the show technically - final preparations for our FIRST SHOW tomorrow !!! Incredibly exciting ! It’s been too long ! And we’ve had time to bring about some new angles - new moments into the show. Tomorrow night at the SSE Arena Belfast, all will be revealed !! Cheers folks - BRI."
