At its first-quarter trading update the broadcaster said it was holding talks with The Pensions Regulator (TPR) to try to reach agreement over how much it should put in. Box Clever was formed in 2000 as a joint venture between the TV rental businesses of ITV's predecessor Granada and Thorn's Radio Rentals. It failed in 2003 and TPR pursued ITV by using its anti-avoidance powers over shortfall payments. The regulator justified this by saying the broadcaster had "extracted significant value" from Box Clever prior to the collapse. The fund has around 2,800 members and has a £115million shortfall. TPR ordered it to financially support the pension fund in 2020, after the broadcaster lost an eight-year legal battle to avoid having to put money into it. Since then, the two sides have been locked in talks to try to reach an agreement on the level of support payments ITV said in its annual report last month that it had set aside £52million for the scheme, an increase of £21million on last year. The firm also said it had agreed with trustees to split a £200million payment due to its own pension scheme into instalments. It will make an upfront payment of £80million this year and then pay £16.4million a year after that until 2031. In its first quarter, ITV said revenues from advertisers and TV networks that buy its programmes rocketed 18 per cent to £834million. Advertising revenues climbed 16 per cent, while those from production and the likes of streaming service BritBox - a joint venture with BBC started in 2019 - grew 18 per cent. Boss Dame Carolyn McCall said a strong digital performance - with revenues up 24 per cent - bodes well for its new streaming service later this year. She added: "All of this provides a solid foundation for ITVX - our free, adfunded streaming service - which is on track for launch in Q4 and we remain confident that we will deliver at least £750million of digital revenue by 2026."
