A royal regiment of red, white and blue is fluttering high above London's Regent Street and Oxford Circus. And more than 4,000 of the UK's national symbols were hung from the roof of Covent Garden to mark Her Majesty's 70-year reign. As the country gears up for the Bank Holiday weekend, British firms have also been busy. Jubilee crockery is on display in Stoke on Trent, where Halcyon Days Ltd - supplier of royal objets d'art - is making commemorative china. Meanwhile Dudley, West Mids, is one of many boroughs looking forward to lighting a beacon on June 2. Councillor Anne Millward said it is a way to show our "support for the Queen" and celebrate how we "have pulled together over a challenging couple of years".
