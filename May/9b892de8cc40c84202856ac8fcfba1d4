It is a strength of our democracy that we expect people who set rules to abide by those same rules. Profound mistakes were made at the heart of Government. The so-called “Partygate” saga has shaken the country’s politics and rightly reminded politicians of all parties of the high standards we expect in public service. Important lessons have been learned and these must not be forgotten. But it is also essential that the country moves on. As Michael Gove argues powerfully in today’s Sunday Express, Boris Johnson has made the right calls on issues of truly historic significance. ----------------------------- Resist the militants Industrial strife paralysed communities and brought distress and difficulty to families on multiple occasions in past decades. Those of us with long memories shudder at the thought of the country once again battling high inflation while strikes inflict misery. There is a vital role for responsible trade unions but the Government should not be intimidated by union leaders who make utterly unreasonable demands which would ultimately hurt services and damage the economy. The RMT risks torching public sympathy if people cannot get to work. Former Thatcher aide Sir Bernard Ingham, who knows what it is involved in resisting militant unions, had simple advice for Boris Johnson: “Don’t give an inch.” We hope that discord will be avoided, but Britons do not give in to bullies. ------------------------------ Happy and glorious This is a wonderful week for the country and the Queen. We will savour this opportunity to celebrate Her Majesty’s extraordinary reign and thank her for her inspirational service. At parties in neighbourhoods throughout the UK, people will feel happy and glorious. This is all thanks to the Queen – and during the bank holidays, millions of us will feel pride and gratitude when we raise a glass in honour of a monarch who is a blessing to this land.
