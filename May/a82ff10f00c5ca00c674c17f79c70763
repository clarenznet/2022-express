Brits are similarly denied cheaper and more plentiful high-quality food and other goods by various tariffs and subsides while big companies across sectors benefit from chemicals to transport benefit from regulations that limit competition. The other obsessions of the Davos crowd is so-called ‘stakeholder capitalism’ that says businesses should focus less on their shareholders and more on issues like woke social justice, the environment and union representation. This stakeholder agenda actively diminishes the importance of profit-seeking enterprise, that delivers quality products to individuals while creating jobs and ensuring our pension funds provide good returns. It wrongly gives the impression that there is something wrong with the business of business, and that it is the role of top executives to solve the world’s problems, rather than running their enterprises. It thus risks entirely undermining the global free market system in the process. The global economy should be shaped by the decisions of billions of individuals and millions of business — not what goes on in Davos. *Matthew Lesh is Head of Public Policy at free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs.
