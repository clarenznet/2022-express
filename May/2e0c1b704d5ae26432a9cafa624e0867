The incentive was announced as the firm continues to vie with competitors for talent, amid staff shortages. Staff can clock off at Friday lunchtime in June, July and August. Kevin Ellis, chairman of PwC UK, said: "We hope our policy gives people more time for themselves, friends and families." The firm noted that over 90 percent of 6,000 staff involved in a pilot of the summer working hours last year thought it was "a good idea," adding that it improved their day-today working experience. In October it brought in a flexible time-off policy so people could take up to two bank holidays at a time that suited them. Meanwhile, Clifford Chance, one of London's oldest law firms, is considering hiring a "chief happiness officer".
