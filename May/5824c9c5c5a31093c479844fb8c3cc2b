Not too long after the controversial episode aired in March 2022, Domenica deactivated her OnlyFans account. This was in response to the drama on the show which was watched by millions of viewers around the world. A few months on and it appears that Domenica has changed her mind. At the weekend on Sunday, May 22, the 28-year-old returned to the OnlyFans platform.  OnlyFans is an online subscription-based service where users can sign up to receive all-access content from their favourite creators. Many of these accounts share adult content but it is up to the creator on what is provided. Opening up to Yahoo, Domenica explained: “It was a stage in my life where not only were we going into a global pandemic, but I had just gone through a divorce. I felt empowered by doing it.” Married at First Sight Australia is available to watch on Channel Nine in Australia and E4 in the UK.
