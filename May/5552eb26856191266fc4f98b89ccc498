 At a joint news conference in Madrid, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that rising instability coupled with hunger in Africa could have a significant impact on Europe. Referencing allegations made by western leaders that last year Russia supported Belarus in encouraging thousands of migrants fleeing war to cross into Ukraine in retaliation to EU sanctions, Mr Wallace said: "If (Russia) can use migrant flows as a weapon at one end of Europe, they can certainly use it at the other." Spain's Margarita Robles added that the expansion of Russian operations in countries like Mali and Libya was "very clear". She said: "NATO cannot remain indifferent in this situation."
