They also plan to turn down the water temperature and ask swimmers to spend less time showering. And charities are warning disabled people will miss out on vital exercise and therapy as a result. Richard Kramer, chief executive of Sense, said the cost-of-living fallout will have a “disproportionate impact” on those with mobility issues. He said: “The movement of the body in water offers a sense of freedom for those with limited mobility and can provide effective physiotherapy. Many will struggle to travel further to find another pool or find the change really disorientating.” The heating bill for public pools is predicted to rocket to £1.25billion this year from £500million in 2019. UKActive, which works with 4,000 organisations to promote a fitter nation, quizzed pool operators. It also found two-thirds expect to axe staff. A coalition of bodies are sending an urgent letter to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Communities Secretary Michael Gove. UKActive chief executive Huw Edwards said: “The pool operators can’t see a way through this unless there is government intervention.”
