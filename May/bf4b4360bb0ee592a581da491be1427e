      Uma, 52, stars in a leading role in The Kill Room, which comes from writer Jonathan Jacobson and director Nicol Paone. She will also act opposite her fellow Pulp Fiction star Samuel L. Jackson, 73. The story follows a hitman, his boss (Samuel), an art dealer (Uma) and a money-laundering scheme that accidentally turns the assassin into an overnight avant-garde sensation. The dark comedy is being filmed in New Jersey, which is where the pictures were taken.  New snaps show a fresh-faced Uma looking relaxed in a loose, cream-coloured blouse with long sleeves and a trail of buttons stopping halfway down the garment. She paired the top with some blue, straight-legged jeans and some black loafers. Uma wore a grey blazer over the white shirt, adding a more formal appearance to her look. She finished off the outfit with some blue, drop-down earrings and a large, deep red handbag.
