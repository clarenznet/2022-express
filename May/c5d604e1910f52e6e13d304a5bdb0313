The largest aircraft carrier in the Royal Navy’s arsenal was seen off of the Plymouth Sound by locals. Capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft, it is the Fleet Flagship of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy confirmed the flagship aircraft carrier is in Devon as part of an exercise. A spokeswoman for Devonport Naval Base said: "HMS Queen Elizabeth is in Plymouth Sound. She's undertaking some training. “I can't tell you if she's fully crewed or has any aircraft onboard as we don't really talk about operations but it's perfectly normal. "Plymouth Sound is our main training area so it's perfectly normal." When operating at full capacity, the HMS Queen Elizabeth is supported by eight other ships, a submarine, five air squadrons and some 3,700 personnel. The Royal Navy said HMS Queen Elizabeth is an "investment in Britain’s security, prosperity and place in the world, providing a conspicuous presence on the global stage, sending a clear message of reassurance to our allies, and of defiance to those who would do us harm". HMS Queen Elizabeth replaced HMS Ocean as the Royal Navy’s Fleet Flagship, and departed Portsmouth in March. It then visited the Clyde in Scotland and is on a seven-month long deployment which includes training exercises off Plymouth. The 65,000 tonne aircraft carrier was last spotted in Gosport on May 15. On Twitter, HMS Queen Elizabeth said: "Over the next few weeks we will be working and training hard to ensure we remain #GlobalModernReady." In 2021, the vessel embarked on her maiden voyage, including South Korea and India. The 28-week deployment saw the ship and her crew visit a range of locations.
