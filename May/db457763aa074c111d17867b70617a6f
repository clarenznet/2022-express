An update from the Institute of War issued on Saturday, May 14, said Russia appeared to have decided to withdraw from Ukraine’s second-largest city a month after its troops pulled away from Kyiv and the northeast over a month ago. It comes as Russia’s military is struggling on the battlefield, with heavy losses of military equipment and personnel. According to an update by Ukraine’s general staff, 27,200 Russian soldiers have been lost since the invasion began. The figure is much higher than the number given by the British Government, which puts the death toll of Russian soldiers at 15,000. Ukraine’s general staff also claimed as many as 1,218 Russian tanks had been destroyed along with 13 warships, including Vsevolod Bobrov which was reportedly struck in the Black Sea this week. Conflict expert Kyrylo Mykhailov told The New Voice of Ukraine that Russian ships are in “serious jeopardy” amid reports that Ukraine has seriously weakened its naval defence in the Black Sea.
