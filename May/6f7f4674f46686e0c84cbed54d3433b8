Demi Rose, 26, took to Instagram to share pictures from her daily workout as she posed while playing a game of tennis. The model made sure not to disappoint as she posed in a barely-there bikini while looking into the distance. Demi's high rise bikini bottoms left her rear on full display as well as her killer curves. The second picture shows the front of the model with her ample assets barely held up by the small bikini top. Demi made sure her hourglass figure was on full display as she posed for the prerogative snaps. She wore a white headband to match the outfit, while she accessorised with a pair of black sunglasses. She styled her signature brunette tresses in two large pig tails, as her wavy tresses fell effortlessly down her shoulders. In view of her 19.6 million followers, Demi captioned the post: "Practice makes perfect!" Many social media users rushed to the comments to compliment the model on her killer physique.
