As described by lead singer Yannis in an interview with The Guardian on Friday, their new album Life is Yours was "written in the midst of Lockdowns. So, we came here and sheltered from all that by writing music that felt escapist and joyful, but also hopeful for the future to come back”. Opener Wake Me Up embodies their new optimistic outlook, which is full of exuberance. The pumped up crowd cheered the trio as their positive energy reflected the flamboyant and futuristic staging, with the large screens projecting a kaleidoscopic array of pink flowers. The floral imagery represents a powerful central theme to Foals’ new world view: one of life and hope. The pink roses on the new album cover were referenced as Yannis flung some into the crowd at the start of the encore.  Yannis has developed into a ferocious frontman, constantly prowling the stage and the audience, culminating with his trademark climb into the crowd during fan favourite ‘What Went Down’, snarling the refrain “When I see a man, I see a liar” into their faces. When the venue lights came up at the end of an explosive 17 song set, the crowd were in a state of pure elation, embracing one another and adorning themselves in the pink confetti and ticker tape that had cascaded from the stage during closer ‘Two Steps, Twice’. Tonight, Foals proved the future is bright for British rock music, and they are leading the way.
