Samantha Brick appeared on the ITV morning show to discuss her experience as a "victim of cancel culture" with hosts, Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Samantha, a journalist, originally made headlines after she published an article on the Daily Mail titled: “Why do women hate me for being beautiful.”   The article turned Samantha into a hate figure, and - at the time - caused her name to be Googled more than the Duchess of Cambridge. Back then she had bright blonde hair but has now switched it up and gone brunette. Despite her dramatic hair change, she still stands by her statement she made ten years ago: "Woman hate me because I'm so beautiful." Her outspoken nature has led to her appearing on a number of shows including The Late Late Show and Big Brother, reports the Examiner Live. However, it appears that viewers did not share her sentiment. In fact, viewers have been quick to blast the 51-year-old for her "deluded" thoughts" and went straight to social media to share their reactions to the segment.  @nyabrandi_ Tweeted: “Sorry but who has gassed up this woman on #ThisMorning ? Not even trying to be mean.” @cb_038 said: “This deluded woman has been on before.. rinse & repeat #ThisMorning.” @leeleeCThomas commented: “#ThisMorning needs to stop enabling people who are delusional. By being asked back on it’s just going to make this woman feel she’s right. I can imagine she was a nightmare in real life after her last appearance.” @kellymcc5 questioned: “What is the point of having this woman on #thismorning?” @Queen_Vix88 wrote: “It’s the deluded woman up next #ThisMorning.” While @suzysasha added: “#ThisMorning @thismorning I'm sorry this woman is just average looking. Why would anyone be jealous of her?”
