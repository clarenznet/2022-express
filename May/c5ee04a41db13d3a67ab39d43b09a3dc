  Liam Gallagher was taken by surprise on the Zoe Ball Breakfast show this morning when he learned it was his brother Noel Gallagher’s birthday. The former Oasis member confirmed he “won’t” be sending Noel a card, but did discuss an alternative tribute that would “do his head in”.      Liam, 49, joined Zoe, 51, on her breakfast show this morning to speak about his new album C’MON YOU KNOW and spoke about his upcoming live performance at Knebworth Park in Stevenage. However, things got awkward when the conversation turned to his older brother, Noel, 54, who he formerly played alongside in their world famous band Oasis. After complimenting a couple of his new tracks as they aired on BBC Radio 2 this morning, Zoe quizzed Liam on whether he had any plans for his brother’s 55th birthday. “I have to mention, it’s your brother Noel’s birthday on Sunday,” Zoe remarked.

Oh well, nice one, I’ll have just done Knebworth.     “Bless him. I might give him a shout out,” Liam continued cheekily. “Dedicate one of his songs to him. That’ll do his head in won’t it?” Laughing rather nervously, Zoe told Liam he was on “fine form” this morning, before swiftly moving on. Liam and Noel have a famous on-running feud that has continued ever since Oasis split up in 2009. READ MORE...

Oasis formed back in 1991 and quickly established themselves as one of the most significant bands of the 1990s. Their first album Definitely, Maybe was released in 1994 and their second 1995 album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? became the second-fastest selling album in British history behind Michael Jackson's Bad. They went on to release Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, Heathen Chemistry, Don't Believe The Truth and Dig Out Your Soul, before finally disbanding after nearly 20 years of performing together.     According to Noel, the reason the two brothers no longer speak is to do with an incident involving clothing that marked “the beginning of the end”. He told The Matt Morgan Podcast: “Liam gave us a load of clobber, not just me, he gave the band it. I went straight to the charity shop and left it in the shop doorway. “He went f***ing mental. He said, “If you didn’t f***ing want it, you should have just said you didn’t f***ing want it, you c***.’” Noel claimed the clothing, which was from Liam’s brand Pretty Green, ended up “on the shop mannequin in Barnardo’s a month before it launched”. The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show airs weekdays from 6:30am on BBC Radio 2.
