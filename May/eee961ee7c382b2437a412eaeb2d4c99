And instead of being ambushed by Javelin toting Ukrainian soldiers or shelled by distant defensive artillery, they are being surrounded by camera-wielding tourists, children who pose on their broken turrets and burnt out hulls. So now they stand charred and broken while onlookers from the city they were intended to conquer loiter about them more out of curiosity than pride. “There are some others in front of Officer’s House,” not far from the Ukrainian parliament and Presidential Administration, says Igor.   There are many more that still litter the country roads and small villages around the capital, where Russian forces were entrenched for around six weeks before being repulsed back across the border and later regrouping for further battle in the east.   According to today’s count of Russian losses, released daily by the Ukrainian armed forces, the enemy has lost over 1300 tanks, more than 3,000 armored vehicles and almost 30,000 men.  The Ukrainian military does not release figures on their own losses. During the first days of the war, isolated armored Russian vehicles were filmed by civilians crushing cars not far from the city center. Within a week, they could be seen lined up in a 40-mile long convoy that many feared would plow slowly but surely into the city. Instead, the once deadly war machines have been turned into somber trophies, charred remnants of a fate that the people of Kyiv have managed to avoid, at least for now.
