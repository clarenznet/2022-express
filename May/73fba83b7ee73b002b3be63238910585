The Platinum Jubilee celebrations promise to bring the best of British patriotism, pomp and pageantry to the UK from Thursday, June 2 to Sunday, June 5. The Queen has beaten the records set by her predecessors to become the first of Britain's monarchs to ever reach 70 years on the throne, a truly remarkable achievement the nation will be rejoicing in this week. The Queen ascended the throne in 1952 following the death of her father, King George VI. Then Princess Elizabeth had left the UK with the Duke of Edinburgh for a royal trip abroad, and she returned to London as Queen Elizabeth II, aged only 25. Now 96, the Queen has firmly left her mark on the British monarchy and she commends incredible respect from her subjects for her unwavering dedication to royal duties.
