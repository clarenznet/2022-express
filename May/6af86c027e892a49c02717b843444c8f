Chelsea have been told by Richard Keys to sign Manchester United star Harry Maguire and Tottenham hero Harry Kane this summer if they are to make a step forward this summer. The Blues are in the market for a striker and several defenders given Romelu Lukaku's poor form alongside Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen's inevitable departures in the summer. Jules Kounde and Matthijs de Ligt amongst others have been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. But Keys, speaking presenting partner Andy Gray, told Chelsea to go for United captain Maguire - much to the bemusement of the Scot. "That's a massive shout for Harry Kane if he went to Chelsea," Gray said on beIN Sports. "If Chelsea want an English spine, which has been suggested, [Harry] Kane, Declan Rice, and they need a centre-back, where is there a centre-back available? Harry Maguire." Keys replied. "What? Are you serious?" Gray said in disbelief to Keys, who confirmed he wasn't joking. And when asked why not by the former presenter, Gray said: "Why? Harry Maguire? Who has had an awful season? No, I can't see Chelsea buying Harry Maguire, I really can't." Keys went on to suggest that Maguire has had an awful season, but none worse than the majority of the United squad. And his outlandish shout simply made his colleague, the former Everton striker, laugh in shock. The Blues currently sit third in the Premier League, needing just one win from their final two games to qualify for the Champions League.
