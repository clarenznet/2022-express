A Place In The Sun presenter Laura Hamilton often travels abroad and soaks up the sun in a number of locations all over the world. The Channel 4 presenter, who recently celebrated her 40th birthday, took to Instagram today and posed for a picture ahead of a photo shoot. In view of her 156,000 followers, Laura took the opportunity to share a selfie as she sported a big smile. The property expert could be seen lying down as she relaxed ahead of her professional shoot. The on-screen star put on a busty display as she almost spilled out of her turquoise swimsuit that featured a low neckline and thin straps. The presenter donned bold makeup and accentuated her features with a smokey eye and blush to highlight her cheekbones. The Channel 4 favourite kept her blonde tresses in loose waves as she beamed at the camera. Laura captioned the post: "Shoot Day!" The property host didn't share any details about the impromptu shoot but appeared to be in high spirits.
