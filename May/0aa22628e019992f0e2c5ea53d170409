Eva Longoria stunned on the last night she graced the Cannes Film Festival yesterday in a daringly cut-out black dress. The Desperate Housewives star, 47, ensured all eyes were on her as she posed for pictures on the red carpet in the stunning number.  The star, who is honorary chair of the Global Gift Foundation, attended The Global Gift Gala photocall during the 75th Cannes Film Festival yesterday in a breath-taking black gown. The stunning design was by Italian designer Roberto Cavalli and perfectly hugged the star's petite frame. Eva dazzled in the classic black dress which skimmed across the floor. The front of the garment featured a beautiful cut out design which gave a glimpse of Eva's incredibly toned stomach. The gold fastenings of the dress perfectly matched her simple hoops of the same metal as well as the rings on her fingers. Eva's dark chocolate tresses had been pulled back into a waist-length mid ponytail, leaving her exposed back on show.
