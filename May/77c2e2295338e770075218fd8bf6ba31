Olly Alexander, 31, debuted a new look as he took to the red carpet at the BAFTA TV Awards. The Years & Years singer walked the red carpet in a cape and sported bleached eyebrows. The black cape was styled as a frilled shirt at the front and had buttons leading to a high-necked, frilled collar. Olly accompanied the bold cape with jeans and a black belt, with the cape stealing the show. To add more vibrance to the outfit, Olly wore large platform laced boots as he strutted down the red carpet. The It's a Sin actor styled the outfit with a silver necklace, rings and stud earrings. Along with his bold bleached eyebrows, Olly went for a closely-shaved head either side. The hair on the top of his head was thicker and shaved into stripes, adding more of a statement to the already eccentric outfit. Channel Four series It’s A Sin, written and created by Russell T Davies, has earned the most Bafta television award nominations this year. The show’s 11 nominations, made up of five in the craft categories and six in the television awards categories, include nods for Davies in the best writer: drama category and Years & Years singer Olly Alexander for leading actor for his role as Ritchie Tozer. The ceremony will air for fans tonight from 6pm on BBC One.
