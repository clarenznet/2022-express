Photographs show the driver of articulated lorry had appeared to turn a sharp right into the narrow road but became very much stuck. Locals in trendy Montpelier, Bristol, said the lorry driver arrived at just before 7am yesterday, and it was there for the rest of the day and into the evening. Police arrived and the roads in the area were blocked - by the HGV - and some kind of operation had to be mounted to extract the lorry from the narrow street. Speaking to Bristol Live, one resident said: "It's been there since 7am. I spoke to the police at the scene, they said they are awaiting recovery. I should imagine it's going to be quite a while before it's moved as it was a real head-scratcher." It's believed the lorry left Avonmouth, Bristol, early yesterday morning to deliver groceries across the city but quickly came into difficulty in the wealthy suburb. People online mocked the gaffe. One Facebook user stated: "If he goes back an inch then forward an inch he should get out. Every little helps." Another posted: "Ah, you can only get down that street if you have a Clubcard." A third shared: "Smear the sides with marge. Every little helps."   Traffic was busy throughout the day, particularly on the adjacent A38, which runs through the city. The main road was particularly congested in both directions from St Andrews to Broadmoad, which is near the city centre. Tesco, one of Britain's "big four" supermarket groups, has declined to comment on the situation. It comes after it was announced a new supermarket chain, which will rival Tesco, Aldi and Lidl's cheap prices, will open in the UK next month.
