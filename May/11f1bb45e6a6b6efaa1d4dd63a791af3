Actor Sir Michael Caine has been seen using a walking frame as he was helped into a car in new photos. Sir Michael, 89, recently had major surgery on his back at a London hospital. As he recovers, he was seen using a walking frame, having swapped out his walking stick which he was previously spotted using. The actor had started using the stick after breaking his ankle in a nasty fall on ice. Sir Michael was dressed all in black, disguised with sunglasses and a cap, as he was helped into the back of a car. “I have a spine problem which affects my leg, so I can't walk very well,” he said earlier this year. His wife Shakira, 75, told the Daily Mail in March: “He had a back operation quite recently. “He had spinal stenosis.”
