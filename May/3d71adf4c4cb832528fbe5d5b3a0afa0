Andrei Kelin said that would only happen if Russia’s “existence is threatened” by the West. When Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February it was widely perceived as a threat. He blamed “aggression” by the West and Nato, and has previously said he believes the West is trying to destroy his country. But Mr Kelin said it was not Russia’s intention to use them in its war on Ukraine. He told Clive Myrie on BBC One’s Sunday Morning: “It has nothing to do with the current operation.” In the face of evidence, the ambassador also claimed allegations of Russian war crimes in Bucha were made up. More than 1,000 bodies were recovered in the city, Northwest of Kyiv, following occupation by Kremlin troops in March. Mr Kelin said: “In our view, it is a fabrication.” Ukraine’s prosecutors are investigating nearly 14,000 cases of war crimes by Russian forces. There may be more than 100,000. Mr Kelin went on to brand Foreign Secretary Liz Truss “very belligerent” and inexperienced. His remarks came after the leaders of France and Germany implored Putin to talk direct with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz spoke with the Russian despot for 80 minutes. Meanwhile, Ukrainian MP Kira Rudyk begged the UK Government to give her country missiles, waive refugee visas and help to unblock its ports. Ms Rudyk, who meets the Defence Committee today, said: “The world right now only has 10 weeks’ supplies of grains." “Politicians of the world need to figure out how to get out all the harvest that Ukraine has.”
