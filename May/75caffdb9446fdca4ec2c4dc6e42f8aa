The former Countdown and Weakest Link host said yesterday she was worried by the lack of debate over it. She said: "I'm horrified by the lack of safety in women's changing rooms, in swimming pools and that sort of thing." Anne added: "A woman is someone with a vagina. I am just horrified that we can't have a debate about this. That's what really troubles me. "I think the most interesting statistic is that the amount of trans [people] who actually get surgically altered is minuscule. So you are talking about men in women's changing rooms." Author JK Rowling faced anger for defending women's rights after she criticised an article in 2020 that referred to "people who menstruate", rather than women. Ms Robinson said there is a difference between the transgender rights row and gay rights. She said: "No. I'm sorry. "Gay marriage, gay rights - we could all debate it. Show me a programme that's debating trans on television. What are they so frightened of?" She said she has never met anyone "who hates the idea that we can define a woman with common sense".
