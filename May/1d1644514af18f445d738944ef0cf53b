Describing the Russian army as "trying to squeeze at least some result for themselves", he insisted Ukraine's defence was holding in "indescribably difficult" conditions. The leader, who will address European Council members today about the terror inflicted across the continent, made a rare trip outside Kyiv yesterday to visit Kharkiv. He told troops there: "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state." The north-eastern city has seen some of the worst fighting since Putin's invasion began. In his address to his nation on Saturday, Mr Zelensky said: "[Our success] depends on the partners, on their readiness to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. "And I expect good news on this already next week."  Boris Johnson has called on the West to provide long-range multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS). But US deliveries have reportedly been held up due to rows in Washington about whether Ukraine may use them to hit areas inside Russia. If the US does deliver the weapons, the UK will follow. The British version of the MLRS can fire 12 missiles in less than a minute but has a more limited range of 52 miles.
