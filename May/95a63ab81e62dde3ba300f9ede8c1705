Model Emily Ratajkowski offered an eye-popping display to onlookers, as she didn't shy away from amping up the glamour during a stroll with her dog. The 30-year-old model looked nothing short of stunning as she strode around, with nothing but mesh stripes covering the totally sheer fabric of her skimpy dress. Emily added a matching black lingerie set, including a lace-trimmed bra, beneath her outfit to maintain her modesty. However, the chic outfit, which she unusually combined with a pair of trainers, certainly caught the eye of everyone around her. Plus, when she turned around, the thong style of her underwear revealed a peachy posterior dressed in nothing but mesh fabric. The day before, Emily had released a promotional video for her Inamorata swimwear brand and its new Butterfly collection.
