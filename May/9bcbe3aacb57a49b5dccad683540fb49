The family from Runcorn were travelling to Turkey for a wedding. Mother and father, Kirsty and Rob Gore, were travelling with their three kids and were due to fly from Manchester Airport to Dalaman at 6.10am on Friday morning. However, there were a series of delays that saw them stuck in the airport for 15 hours. This included sitting on the plane which was grounded on the runway for two and half hours, they were finally told their flight had been cancelled. Now they have been told their next available jet is not due to depart until 10.30am on Sunday. The family had spent Â£6,500 on an eight-night all-inclusive TUI package holiday in Fethiye, for Kirsty's sister's wedding. Now they've been put up in a city centre hotel and face an anxious wait to see if they get to Turkey in time for the ceremony on Monday afternoon.  TUI has apologised for the cancellation. They have also offered full refunds to all affected passengers Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Kirsty said: "It's been horrendous. "We got to the airport at 3am on Friday and spent more than 12 hours sitting there and two and half hours sat on the plane. "All my family are in Turkey for my sister's wedding and we just hope we get there in time. "My husband has cancer and this is the first family holiday we've had since he got diagnosed.   "It's been an emotional rollercoaster. "We've been treated like cattle. "The only people who have told us the truth have been the pilot and the staff on the plane. "There was no one from TUI in the airport to explain what was going on. We didn't speak to anyone from TUI until 3pm. "We took time off work, the kids had the day off school and the whole thing has just been absolutely shocking."
