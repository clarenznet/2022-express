Britney Spears sparked a frenzy among her Instagram followers yesterday after sharing a revealing set of snaps of herself completely in the nude while holding her dog. Since announcing her pregnancy and following the end of her 13-year conservatorship battle, the "Baby One More Time" singer, 40, has been basking in her freedom on social media. Britney looked sensational as she only had puppy Sawyer and a carefully placed diamond emoji to protect her modesty. She typed: "If you love someone, set them free. If you hate someone, set them free. Basically set everyone free and get a dog. People are stupid.” In response, fans gushed over the star. lilkimvideos_typed: “BRITNEY SHAKING UP THE GRAM AS USUAL.” itsjimmybtch replied: “QUEEN OF POP I LOVE YOU.”
