Remi the Dogue de Bordeaux's abnormally large tongue does not affect her at all and only adds to her apersonality. The six-year-old arrived at Helping Yorkshire Poundies earlier this month after living as a stray in kennels. Charity volunteer, Sarah Dobbs, told The Mirror: "Remi's tongue is way too long for her mouth so it's always poking out, but we think that just adds to her cuteness. "She is 100% adorable and such a sweet and friendly girl, fed up of living in kennels." The Rotherham rescue hopes to find Remi a permanent home with plenty of room and a secure garden to chill out. She is quite a "laid back" dog and loves a good snooze - with her hanging tongue out - so a spot on the sofa is ideal. When Remi first arrived, staff were quick to give her lots of cuddles but soon noticed a large lump in her neck. They feared she had a type of cancer called lymphoma, but thankfully her tests came back clear. Sarah said: "We're waiting on some blood results for her, but it's looking like it could be good news for Remi." The special girl has been taking it easy and lapping up all the attention she can get. Remi could live with a larger male dog but cannot live with cats. She is great on the lead and walks well. She is housetrained, not destructive and seems to cope fine being left for a few hours. If you think you would be the perfect match for Remi, please visit Helping Yorkshire Poundies website and fill in an application to adopt her.
