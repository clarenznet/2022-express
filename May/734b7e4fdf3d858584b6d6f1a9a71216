The plane was spotted by multiple eyewitnesses on Ikeja Along, a motorway in Lagos, Nigeria. One unverified video posted to Twitter by user @Instablog9ja showed the plane with one missing wing. It was not immediately clear what happened to the plane, which appeared to be severely damaged. The aircraft was seen on Agege Motor Road near the busy Ikeja Along Bus Stop, witnesses said. It is unclear which airline the plane belongs to, as the aircraft was unmarked. Some commenters said it crash-landed but others said it was being towed to a repair workshop near the airport. Videos and images of the chaos were shared on Twitter, with one eyewitness Mac Henry writing: "I just saw a plane crash around Ikeja along."  Another, Adedayo (@lollydeee) wrote: "There's a plane on ikeja along". Ms Petite (@Un_botherd) added: "I don't know what happened but I saw the plane on my way home this evening around 7:30pm. "It is at Ikeja Along inside the FAAN territory". FAAN, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, is located next to the busy road. A fourth eyewitness, Miss Endy (@endyliciouss) asked: "How did this aeroplane get here please. "I need an explanation." But user @IWLTCTY suggested that the plane was being towed, writing: "There's obviously a truck/trailer towing it. "A Plane cannot crash land at Ikeja along without series of explosions due to collision with cars." Meanwhile, another, @Tsolajames, joked: "They want load passengers on Ikeja along it's cheaper that way."
