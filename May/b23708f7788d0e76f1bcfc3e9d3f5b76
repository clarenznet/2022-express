George Brandis, the former Australian High Commissioner to the UK, wrote in The Times that Britain needed to "rediscover the spirit of enterprise that once defined it". The Australian diplomat added that the UK's Civil Service "was still struggling to come to terms with the fact that the public had decreed that Britain would withdraw from the European Union". Mr Brandis claimed that Whitehall has failed to grasp the prospect of a "truly global Britain" and that this attitude is cultural rather than shaped by economic reality. Mr Brandis added that, "a near half-century cocooned within the EU has, in some sectors, taken the edge off the spirit of enterprise which once so defined Britain". FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
