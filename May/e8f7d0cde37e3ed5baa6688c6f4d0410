Just as Top Gun: Maverick is about to explode onto the big screen around the world, Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible 7 trailer has landed after initially leaking over the weekend. The new footage for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One promises returning franchise favourites from Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames to Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby. Yet the biggest surprise is seeing a character back for the first time since the 1996 original. Henry Czerny returns as Eugene Kittridge, the former director of IMF, and he's asking Ethan Hunt to pick a side. Little is known about the plot of Christopher McQuarrie's third Mission: Impossible movie, but there are a few new characters in the mix. Most notably, Hayley Atwell co-stars as Grace, who the filmmaker says has "somewhat ambiguous" loyalties and is a "destructive force of nature". Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hits cinemas on July 14, 2023 and the sequel Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two follows on June 28, 2024.
