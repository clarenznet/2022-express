Lorraine Kelly discussed the latest on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee with royal commentator Russell Myers on Thursday's instalment of her ITV show. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will reportedly join the monarch and the rest of the Royal Family for a Jubilee service of thanksgiving. However, Lorraine demanded the Sussexes "get on with it" in a bid to heal their rift with the royals. Russell explained: "The Platinum Jubilee celebrations are in the next few days and Harry and Meghan are coming in, but I can already reveal there has been a reunion because Madame Tussauds has released some new pictures this morning of Harry and Meghan about to jet in as the waxworks have had a bit of a makeover." The waxworks are part of a new Platinum Jubilee exhibition and they feature the monarch as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton. Lorraine added: "We want them all to be together and for goodness sake, just get over this." Russell interjected, telling ITV viewers he was sure there would be "some fireworks". Lorraine continued: "You know what it is like with families - when there is something like big do, you have to all kind of get on with it." More to follow...
