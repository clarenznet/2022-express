Jeff Bezos, 58, looked happier than ever as he cosied up to his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, 52, at a commencement ceremony at MIT in Massachusetts. The businessman couldn't keep his hands off his girlfriend as he planted kisses on her cheek while at the event Lauren stunned in a dark blue print bodycon dress, while Jeff looked dapper in a suit and shades. Neither were listed as a guest speaker at the ceremony. The pair, seemingly deep in conversation at times, also exchanged laughs as the ceremony progressed. The graduation festivities come just days after Amazon, the online shopping venture that made Bezos the second-richest man in the world, celebrated a milestone anniversary. Taking to Instagram on May 17 he wrote: "25 years ago yesterday, AMZN went public. As the Grateful Dead would say, 'What a long, strange trip it’s been,' "It’s been far from smooth. Lots of risk-taking, lots of invention, lots of mistakes, so much we still have to do better. I wouldn’t trade the ride for anything." He launched the online retailer in 1994 with support from his now-ex MacKenzie Scott. In addition to celebrating the successes of his business ventures, Jeff has also been spending time publicly criticizing President Joe Biden's economic agenda. He and the White House squared off on May 16 over the Biden administration's handling of U.S. inflation and its plans to tax the rich.
