Within minutes of Lauren’s tweet going live, Piers retaliated: “a) It’s ‘Piers’.“b) Do you want to discuss why I should be more kind and tolerant like you?”Lauren’s attack comes after Piers weighed into the “gender debate” on his TalkTV show, Piers Morgan Uncensored.The segment began with Piers discussing Labour MP Stella Creasy’s claim that a “woman can have a penis”. Her claim was made in a Daily Telegraph article headlined: “JK Rowling is wrong - a woman can have a penis."  Ms Creasy expanded on her comment within the article, stating: “Do I think some women were born with penises?   The host later went on: “A woman is an adult female who does not have a penis...it’s a biological fact, you can’t refute basic scientific sexual physiology...a gender is a different matter.“It’s a free society, you can identify as whatever you please.“That doesn’t mean that the rest of us have to buy into it, or that society has to change all the rules to suit your latest identity whim.”Piers Morgan: Uncensored continues weekdays at 8pm on TalkTV.
