Max Verstappen was left furious in FP2 after his brakes caught fire, forcing him to retire from the session in Miami.  But those same issues from Bahrain and Australia appear to be back this weekend. FP1 saw each team trying to get used to the new track around the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium. And Verstappen proved once again that Red Bull have the pace to challenge, finishing third fastest. FP2 was a chance for drivers to run different set ups but the session was stopped short after Carlos Sainz crashed out. Verstappen was showing no signs of getting out of his garage with Red Bull decided to 'precautionarily' change the Dutchman's gearbox.  "We don't want another DNF" is the reasoning Red Bull gave for changing Verstappen's gearbox. And they eventually got Verstappen out on track for the first time in FP2 but, just seconds later, he was on the radio complaining of steering issues. Cameras quickly honed in on Verstappen's car with smoke coming out of the rear. And Verstappen's right rear was on fire at one point as he slowly made his way around the track.  "I can't f***ing steer," he says on team radio. "I can't do anything. I'm really sorry." At one stage, Verstappen's lack of steering almost led to a crash with Lance Stroll on track. The Aston Martin driver was on a hot lap and trying to get past Verstappen, but was unaware the Red Bull was struggling. It's the latest reliability concern for Red Bull in their battle to keep pace with Ferrari. When Verstappen's had a car capable of finishing the race, he's won on both occasions. But two DNFs have meant that he's dropped behind Charles Leclerc in the standings and more issues to fix in Miami don't bode well for Sunday's race.
