The drivers, aged 48 and 44, were pronounced dead at the scene last night, according to local police. The teenage boy was believed to be travelling with the 44-year-old. Hampshire Constabulary is now appealing for witnesses or anyone who may be able to offer information about the crash. In a statement released this afternoon (Tuesday), the force said the incident had occurred on Portsdown Hill just before 7.10pm on Monday. Officers had been called to James Callaghan Drive, which runs off Portsdown Hill to the west, following reports of a collision involing a black Peugeot 207 and a grey Renault Megane.  The driver of the Renault - the 48-year-old - came from Gosport, Hampshire police said; the Peugeot driver, 44, came from Fareham.
