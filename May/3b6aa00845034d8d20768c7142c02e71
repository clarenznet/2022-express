Fiery presenter Eamonn Holmes recalled a feud with Anthea Turner which saw him splashed across the headlines and fearing that both might lose their careers. The former This Morning star revealed all in a recent interview. "I was on the front pages of the papers because of a falling-out I had with Anthea Turner - I called her 'Princess Tippy Toes'," Eamonn admitted. "It’s laughable now, but at the time it was deadly serious for both of us. "It could have cost both of us our jobs, but the station probably secretly relished the publicity," he told The Telegraph. He added that he and Anthea quickly made up and are now good friends - but that didn't happen before the war of words had descended into a scandal.

Anthea believed she had been the victim of sexist stereotypes for being too "ambitious" - a trait she claimed men would never be accused of in a derogatory way. "If I said [I was ambitious], I was made out to be a ruthless person who would walk over anybody to get where I wanted," she stated to The Sun. "It would be said that I was hormonal, or I was stamping my feet." She added: "Yet if [a man is] ambitious, we think, 'What a guy'. "You’d never hear anyone say that about Eamonn or Phillip Schofield. No, they’re just doing their job." Anthea quit the show in 1996 after a spat with her co-star Eamonn, which had led him to describe her in subsequent interviews as "demanding". However, despite the tension at that time, they have now healed their rift.  Anthea chuckled: "There is a fine line between hate and love isn't there?" She added: "Eamonn and I are a bit lazy and it's easier to stay friends!" Though at the height of her struggles with her former co-star, she reported feeling "physically sick" at having to come into work and face him, she now seems to truly have buried the hatchet.
