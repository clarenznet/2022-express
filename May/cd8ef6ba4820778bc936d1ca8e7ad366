Got an old iPhone stuffed in a drawer or have just upgraded to a shiny new Galaxy and still own your previous Samsung smartphone? You might want to consider heading online and taking a look at what it's worth as trade-in values may surprise you. There are a swathe of firms that aim to make it easy to hand over old phones in return for cash but one company, called Mozillion, has just revealed full values for some of the most popular devices and it appears handing over your previous call maker can seriously boost your bank account. It's no surprise that coming out on top for trade-in values is the iPhone with Apple tech almost always holding its value far better than its rivals. According to Mozillion, an old iPhone X - which was first released back in 2017 - is still worth around £180. That's not bad for a device that's almost five years old. If you've still got your iPhone XR (released 2018) this could be worth £210 with the iPhone 11 (released 2019) worth around £310. Prefer Android to Apple? Don't panic as things also look good for Galaxy owners with the Galaxy S21 Ultra worth over £600 when trading it in. Other Android handsets that could be worth handing over include the Huawei P30 Pro (£165) and Motorola Razr (£200). READ MORE: Broadband warning! Don't make the simple mistake that will slow down your internet Here's the full list of phones and what they could be worth. Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max (128GB) • £916.00 Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) • £649.00 Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) • £430.00 Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) • £310.00 Apple iPhone XS (64GB) • £220.00 Apple iPhone XR (64GB) • £210.00 Apple iPhone X (64GB) •  £180.00 Samsung S21 Ultra (128GB) • £600.00 Samsung S21 • £375.00 Google Pixel Pro 6 • £549.00 Huawei P40 Pro Plus • £300.00 Huawei P30 Pro • £165.00 Motorola Razr • £200.00 It's worth noting that to get the best price the device will need to be in good condition and free from broken screens or smashed corners. You'll also get more money if the phone is fully unlocked rather than being tied to a particular network such as EE, Vodafone or O2. Speaking about the latest stats Len Leeson, founder of Mozillion, said: "Pretty much everyone has a previous phone or two buried away in a drawer. However, with the cost of living starting to bite, selling your phone can be a great way of making some very useful cash. Selling your handset also helps someone else find their dream phone at a nice discount, and saves a perfectly working mobile phone from heading to landfill - a win-win for everyone." Of course, Mozillian is just one of many trade-in sites and it's worth shopping around to see which firm will give you the best price for your device. It's also worth checking out any deals from the technology brands themselves with Apple and Samsung both offering cashback when you hand over your old devices. Right now, Samsung is offering a guaranteed £200 off its new Galaxy S22 when customers hand over an ageing Android device that can be in any condition. Apple also has its trade-in store which lets you get money off a new iPhone or a gift card to spend on other devices.
