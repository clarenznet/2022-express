The Prime Minister addressed politicians via a video link, declaring Ukraine will ultimately defeat Vladimir Putin's forces in a fight of "good versus evil". He said Ukraine had proven military experts "completely wrong". Mr Johnson's address, which was given a rapturous standing ovation, also confirmed the UK will send support worth £300million to Ukraine in the coming weeks. In the recorded address, he told the Verkhovna Rada - Ukraine's parliament - that the "so-called irresistible force of Putin's war machine has broken on the immovable object of Ukrainian patriotism". The PM said: "Ukraine will win, Ukraine will be free." "You have proved the old saying - it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog." "This is Ukraine's finest hour, that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come." He said the conflict is about "freedom versus oppression", "right versus wrong" and "good versus evil". The PM added: "In the coming weeks, we in the UK will send you Brimstone anti-ship missiles and Stormer anti-aircraft systems. We are providing armoured vehicles to evacuate civilians." "I can announce today from the UK Government a new package of support totalling £300million, including radars to pinpoint the artillery bombarding your cities." "We will carry on supplying Ukraine with weapons, funding and humanitarian aid until we have achieved our long-term goal, which must be to fortify Ukraine so that no one will ever dare to attack you again." Ukrainian MPs in the chamber could be seen holding a Union Flag and the Ukrainian flag.
