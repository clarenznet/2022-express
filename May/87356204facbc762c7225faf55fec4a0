Bosses at maximum security HMP Full Sutton, near York, which holds some of the UK's most dangerous prisoners, have decided to crack down on the amount of sugar inmates can consume. They've cut the amount from 1kg of granules each month to 1kg of sugar every three months, which equates to a loss of around six teaspoons each day. Inmates are furious about the decision, according to the Mirror. A prison source said: "Offenders take their tea and coffee very, very seriously. "It's a comfort which they rely on, and for those who have a sweet tooth this will be devastating news." There are reportedly fears that the sugar slash will cause some lags to resort to violence at the East Yorkshire jail, home to more than 500 criminals, the Mail on Sunday reports.  The sugar cut has emerged in a new report by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), released last week. It said inmates had enough resources for 250 teaspoons of sugar every month. But the new health regime means inmates are reduced to having 330g of sugar per month. Prisoners in the past year have made 190 complaints, compared to 161 the previous year, with many moaning about food and their limited sugar intake and time allowed out of their cells. The rpeport says one reason for the health kick is needed is that healthy living groups had to be put on hold during Covid. In the last two years, obesity rates in jails across the UK have increased as inmates ordered in from the canteen to supplement their diet as Covid meant they were locked up for most of the day.
