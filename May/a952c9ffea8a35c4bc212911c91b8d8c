Alcaraz, 19, has carried his searing form this year into Paris, and was ruthless in his last-16 match against Karen Khachanov, prevailing 6-1 6-4 6-4. Three of his four wins have come on the showpiece Phillipe Chatrier court, whole Zverev, 25, has graced there just once. Like his compatriot, 13-time champion Rafael Nadal has also played on Phillipe Chatrier three times, and top seed Novak Djokovic on twice. The two icons have become embroiled in their own scheduling row ahead of their quarter-final on Tuesday night, with Djokovic getting his preferred option of a late evening start. But whilst German star Zverev is prepared to accept both players getting the top billing, he's taken issue with Alcaraz being afforded the same treatment: “We [Carlos Alcaraz and me] have Novak and Rafael on our side of the tournament. And it is normal, if they are on your side of the tournament they get what they want, and that’s okay," Zverev told Eurosport Germany.

But Zverev argued that didn't justify him frequently playing on the top court: “I get that he is the exciting new mega talent in tennis. I am still the No. 3 in the world, but this is nothing about me," he continued.

This is extremely interesting for me.” It has been an eventful time in Paris for Zverev, who was booed in his second-round win after erupting at his team when he hit a double fault against Sebastian Baez. Following that victory, he argued with a reporter in his post-match press conference.
