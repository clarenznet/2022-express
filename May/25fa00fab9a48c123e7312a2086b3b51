Sergio Perez won a hugely eventful Monaco Grand Prix that failed to reach the full race distance of 78 laps on Sunday afternoon. The Mexican driver pipped Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen to the chequered flag on an afternoon full of frustrating delays and unprecedented twists on the streets of Monte-Carlo. A huge pre-race downpour saw the start delayed before the red flags were brought out on the formation lap due to the weather conditions, prompting an hour-long pause before the action finally got underway behind the safety car. Pole-sitter Charles Leclerc then suffered from a pit-stop mix-up to knock him out of the lead, with the 24-year-old maintaining his unfortunate spell of bad luck at his home Grand Prix in the process. The race was then red-flagged once again on lap 30 when Mick Schumacher lost control before slamming into the barriers at high speed, with the impact splitting his Haas car in two. The German driver managed to walk away unscathed but the incident sparked another lengthy delay that ultimately saw the on-track action capped at the FIA's two-hour limit. Perez ultimately managed to hold off Sainz when the race got back underway to clinch his first Grand Prix victory of the new season at F1's showpiece event. It was another hugely frustrating weekend for Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton, though, with the seven-time champion only coming home in eighth place after picking up slight damage as a result of a minor collision with Esteban Ocon, who was given a five-second time penalty for his role in the incident.
