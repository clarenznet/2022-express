Snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan clinched his seventh victory at the Crucible on May 2, taking home the Â£500,000 top prize. After the record-matching win, he hugged two of his children at the arena. But one of his children was not there, 25-year-old Taylor-Ann Magnus, who is the mother to his only grandchild. O'Sullivan dated Magnus' mother - Sally-Ann Magnus - for two years in the 1990s. Although they welcomed a child, the snooker star has not been a consistent presence in her life, his daughter has alleged. In a recent interview, she claimed that they had only met her sporting father occasionally while growing up. The last time she saw him, she told the Daily Mirror, was six to seven years ago, when she was "17 or 18", adding that she "forgave him within myself". But, she said, it doesn't "excuse what he did", and she has been "quite happy" over the last eight years. Since she has welcomed her daughter, three-year-old Zarah, Magnus said she would not allow Mr O'Sullivan to meet her, adding: "I've accepted he won't be there and I'm OK with that." She branded their relationship with him "tragic" at the time and said she was once "desperate for his attention". O'Sullivan has two other children, Lily and Ronnie Jr, born in 2006 and 2007. He welcomed both with his former partner Jo Langley, who he met at Narcotics Anonymous. They have made appearances at his winning matches while growing up, with their latest at the Crucible - hugging their father after his May 2 victory. O'Sullivan is currently involved with Laila Rouass, his ex-fiancee with whom he split earlier this year.
