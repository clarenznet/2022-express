The road in question, Askew Road, has seen more bus lane fines given out to drivers than any other across Tyne and Wear, County Durham, and Northumberland. A total of 29,895 charges were issued from the town centre spot between April 2021 and March 2022. This equates to almost £1.8million worth of £60 notices. Luckily for drivers, Gateshead Council put a complete hold on fines on Askew Road between October and January while the street was being redesigned. Otherwise, the number of fines could have been significantly higher. Gateshead Council’s service director for highways and waste, Marc Morley, said the authority was “as fair as possible” in its operation of the controversial Askew Road camera.

Drivers had also previously dubbed the bus lane a "premeditated cash cow" and hit out at the signage around it, Chronicle Live reported. Mr Morley said: “There are prominent signs and road markings in place to inform drivers they cannot use this stretch of road, and we have repeatedly adapted and improved that signage and the markings since the bus lane was first introduced. “In 2019, before the bus lane was introduced, this stretch of Askew Road saw, on average, almost 497,000 journeys per month.
