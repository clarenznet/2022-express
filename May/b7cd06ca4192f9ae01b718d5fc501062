Amanda Holden, 51, took to Instagram today to showcase the stylish outfit she wore to Heart Radio. The presenter put her toned pins on display in a pink blazer and skirt co ord that she paired with a matching shoulder bag. She stuck to pastel tones as she complemented the look with a lilac shirt and stiletto heels. A Boomerang shared to her instagram Story earlier today showed Amanda strutting towards the camera on a rooftop terrace. In a later picture posted in view of her 1.8 million followers, Amanda looked casual as she posed with one hand on her hip revealing the shirt underneath her blazer. For today’s look, Amanda chose a comfortable updo consisting of a high bun. In contrast, her makeup featured a bold smokey eye and long lashes with a natural lip.
