Fortnite fans will need to download a brand new update in order to play Battle Royale online. The new Fortnite update is currently available on PS5, PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch and Android devices. There's no word on an Xbox release, so stay tuned for more information. In the meantime, update 3.57 will be ready to download next time you boot up your PC, console, or smartphone. We're investigating an issue where some players are unable to process payments using the Xsolla Payment Gateway. Will provide more info when we have a fix. The issue with Xsolla Payment Gateway has been identified and resolved. Thank you for your patience! The update is said to weigh in at roughly 1.8GB for some PlayStation users, although sizes typically vary by platform. The news was revealed by Epic Games on Twitter, alongside a brief description about what to expect. "We've released a maintenance patch for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Android devices to address stability issues. The patch will be downloaded the next time you launch the game," reads an Epic tweet. As you can see from the tweet above, the patch notes amount to little more than stability improvements. However, Epic has already released a fix for a previous issue with processing payments using the Xsolla Payment Gateway. It's the second Fortnite update this week, after update 20.40 made its debut on May 17. The recent update added the Sideways Showdown Week, which means the return of the Sideways Rifle and Sideways Minigun. Speaking of items, fans can vote between Shield Bubbles and Balloons by using the funding stations. Elsewhere, Epic Games has made improvements to latency on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. "We've made performance improvements to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles running in 60 FPS that reduce input latency for players who select “Low Input Latency Mode” in the settings (Settings > Game > Extra Game Options). Low Input Latency has been enabled by default."
