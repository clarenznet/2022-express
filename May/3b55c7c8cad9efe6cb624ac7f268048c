Arsenal and Newcastle transfer chiefs have been dealt a huge blow in their bid to sign Real Madrid star Eden Hazard after Los Blancos boss Carlo Ancelotti confirmed that the Belgian is set to stay. Hazard joined the Spanish champions for an initial £90million in 2019, for a fee that could rise to around £130m with add-ons. However, his career in the capital has not gone as expected, scoring just six goals and registering 10 assists in 65 games. Arsenal and Newcastle were credited with an interest in his services in January in a bid to end the former Chelsea star's miserable time in Madrid. But they have been dealt a huge dent after Real Madrid boss Ancelotti told interested parties that he wasn't leaving. "His plan is quite clear. He stays," Ancelotti said via ESPN on Saturday. "He has a lot of motivation because he hasn't had a good time these last few years and he wants to show all of his quality, which for many reasons he hasn't been able to do. "With a squad at the level of Real Madrid you play a lot of games. There's tiredness and we'll rotate, even if we haven't much this year. With a more complete squad you can rotate more and everyone can have their chance." "I think the quantity of minutes isn't so important, it's about the quality. We have a clear example which is Rodrygo -- he hasn't played a lot of minutes but he's played with great quality and made the difference." Hazard made his name at Chelsea with 110 goals in 352 games for the Blues. His exploits saw the club win two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two Europa Leagues throughout his seven-year tenure. He was voted Premier League Player of the Season in 2014-15 after a superb season under Jose Mourinho. Whether he would still be able to repeat that form in England is a question that has divided opinion amongst pundits. But there is no doubting he would still be a valuable asset to either Arsenal or Newcastle if a deal can somehow be done.
