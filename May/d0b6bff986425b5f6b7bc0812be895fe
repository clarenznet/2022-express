The massive fence will act as an air quality barrier on the northbound verge of the A494 in Deeside, north Wales, the authorities claim. It will run some 700 metres along the 50-mph dual-carriageway and is designed to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide, a a gaseous air pollutant. But those living near the trunk road have compared the structure to the Berlin Wall. One person told North Wales Live it is "one of the barmiest schemes to have come from the Welsh Government in Cardiff." Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami, of the Labour Party, said: "A barrier is not the answer and is an unacceptable imposition on the community. We need the Red Route and we need it now." A Red Route would instead result in the creation of a new 13km (eight mile), two-lane dual carriageway linking the A55 at Northop with the A494 and A550 north of Deeside Parkway. Mark Isherwood, North Wales Senedd member, said: "Concerns have been raised with me by constituents that the Welsh Government are determined to go ahead with these plans despite all the arguments they have made against them. "(They have said) that these fences will stand 30 feet or nine metres high, and that assurances provided that the fences won’t stop daylight from going into houses and that trees will be planted to soften the effect do not provide the reassurance they seek. Constituents have also stated that they ‘view this as about one of the barmiest schemes to have come from the Welsh Government in Cardiff’, and that they ‘hope that there is something that you can do to stop this madness’. "I further note that Welsh Government planning documents themselves state ‘driver exposure to pollution, inside the barriers, has the potential to increase’." A government spokesperson said: "Plans for the environmental barriers are currently at an early stage. A consultation will begin once the planning application has been made."
