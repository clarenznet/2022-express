Former Downton Abbey actress Lily James, 33, represented the Brits at Monday’s Met Gala 2022 in a dazzling Versace gown. The asymmetric dress was completely see-through with just lace detailing and strategically placed beads to cover the actress’ modesty. The dress was totally backless and featured a thigh-high split that showcased the Pam and Tommy star’s long legs, which she elongated with a pair of towering platform heels Lily ensured all eyes were on her stunning dress by styling her sleek hair away from her face, which gave spectators a full view of its one-shouldered neckline with a cut-out. She accessorised with some sparkling drop earrings, which complemented her silver eyeshadow and nude lip. This year’s Met Gala theme was “Gilded Glamour and White Tie”. It references the lavish era of American fashion in the last decades of the 19th century, when industrialisation rapidly increased the country's wealth gap. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, designer Tom Ford and Adam Mosseri chaired the event. This year’s hosts were Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, as well as Regina King and Lin-Manuel Miranda.
