On Monday, photos of Prime Minister Boris Johnson appearing at a leaving do for then communications chief Lee Cain were published by ITV News. The event took place on November 13, 2020, just days after the PM had ordered a second national lockdown in England. Mr Johnson was not fined for attending the event by the Metropolitan Police, which ended its own investigation into the Partygate saga last week.  In total, the force issued 126 fixed penalty notices, of which Mr Johnson received one for his attendance at his Downing Street birthday party in June 2020. Sue Gray’s own report into Government lockdown parties is expected to be published this week. Labour said there was now “no doubt” that Mr Johnson had “lied” to MPs. So, do you think the emergence of new photos means that Mr Johnson should resign? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
