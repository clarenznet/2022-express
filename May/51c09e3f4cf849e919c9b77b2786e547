One eye-witness tweeted just after noon that police had turned up and with alerts going off. Another said that as of 12.30pm there were "literally like 500 school kids outside waiting".  In an update at 12.05pm this afternoon, the museum said: "The museum has been evacuated as a precaution. Our priority is the safety of our visitors and colleagues." The Metropolitan Police told MyLondon that the evacuation appeared to have been caused by a fire alarm. The regional publication said, though, that the London Fire Brigade had not been called. The museum appeared to confirm the fire alarm occurrence in an update just before 1pm. It said: "An engineer is on site looking into what caused the alarm system to trigger. "We thank visitors for their patience and will be in touch with ticket bookers affected. We will provide a further update on reopening as soon as we are able." Some people who had tickets for exhibitions had previously queried what they should do if the museum were to remain closed. Others had speculated that the cause of the evacuation might have been Extinction Rebellion, which have protested against the museum's sponsorship by oil companies. Another person, purporting to be with a school group, said: "Everyone is safe and science museum staff have been fantastic". The Science Museum is one of several institutions that sits on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, near the V&A and the Natural History Museum. The building has previously been evacuated a number of times - the last also being as a precaution in April this year. In June last year, an unattended bag in the museum sparked panic and another evacuation. As the building had been hosting a Covid vaccination clinic at the time, it added extra confusion for those who missed their slots as a result of the alarm. And in early April, a fire on the roof of the science museum in Bristol caused the evacuation of the building and for police to cordon off the surrounding area. More to follow...
