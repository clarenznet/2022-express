This year, designers were encouraged to focus on wild and natural spaces, illustrated by wildflower meadows, woodland, and native plants. Our natural world is in crisis and drawing attention to the need to create more wild spaces is critical to turn things around. Chelsea should be a catalyst for embracing a wilder future.  The judges’ decision to give the coveted crown to the rewilding garden received a mixed reaction in the showground. Some critiqued the garden and its beaver dam as looking downtrodden, jumbled, and a bit, well, messy. But that’s where nature is at its best. Beavers are brilliant at creating wetland landscapes that store water and reduce the risk of flooding downstream. In the process, their damp boggy habitats become wildlife havens for a myriad of other species. Shining a light on this keystone species and the importance of native planting is a stroke of genius. The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world with 15 percent of species at risk of becoming extinct. A gargantuan effort is required to stop animals like hedgehogs, water voles and red squirrels from disappearing forever. We need to create wilder landscapes, with wetlands, meadows, shrubs and trees. Beyond that, it is crucial to connect existing strongholds for wildlife to enable species to move through landscapes. Hedgerows, field margins and indeed gardens have a fundamental role to play in creating these new networks for nature.
