Elsa Hosk risked a wardrobe malfunction today as she took to the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival in a daring fuschia number which barely covered her assets. The star dazzled in the floor-length, hot pink dress as she arrived at the screening of Elvis today.  However, the Victoria Secrets model, 33, risked a wardrobe malfunction thanks to the daring design of the garment. The dramatic number swept across the floor and featured a regal train to add to the effect. Elsa also wore a pair of matching hot-pink gloves which perfectly complemented the dress. However, it was the unusual neckline which was sure to have garnered the most attention. The garment featured a U-shaped neckline which ended near the model's stomach and only just covered up her assests. At times, Elsa posed for pictures with her hands just above her hips, undoubtedly to help keep the daring dress in place. She kept her accessories minimal and wore only a silver diamond choker and matching bracelet to the glitzy event.
