The latest weather forecasts suggest the UK is standing before a fairly average, if not a cooler-than-usual week, of weather. But, from Sunday onwards, temperatures will rise to the high 20s across much of Britain. Before the warmer weather comes calling, the highest temperatures will be around the low 20s. These are set to reach 22C or 23C in the southeast today, on May 9, according to the BBC. It will, however, be much cooler in the west. Parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland could also see rain. This trend will continue tomorrow, with the latest Weather for the Week Ahead report suggesting parts of western UK could even see rain and thunder. The weather will remain more windy and unsettled as the week progresses. Temperatures are expected to stay fairly average for the season. The weekend will bring with it changes to this pattern, including higher temperatures.

He told Express.co.uk the UK is set (starting Sunday) to experience a “mini-heatwave”. Mr Dale said the wave should last for “five-six days”. He added: “The southeast may reach 28C at the peak.” UK weather maps also show most of the UK will be untouched by rain as the warmer temperatures bake down. There are no weather warnings from the Met Office for the week ahead. This is unlikely to change given the increasingly steady conditions.
