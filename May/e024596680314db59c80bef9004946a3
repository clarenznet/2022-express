Xbox Series X fans can pick up the in-demand Microsoft console in the UK today, thanks to restocks at a number of major retailers. Amazon UK, GAME, Very, Currys and Hamleys all have the Xbox Series X in stock today, with a range of purchase options available. Amazon UK has the Xbox Series X as available to buy on its own - as well as with speedy Prime delivery so you can hold of your shiny new next-gen console as quick as possible. Hamleys also has the Xbox Series X as available to buy on its own as does Very who also have a Game Pass bundle available. While Currys has a few Xbox Series X bundles available and GAME has a range of Xbox Series X purchase options. This includes Xbox Series X available to purchase via Xbox All Access, which helps you spread the cost of your console with monthly payments. Other Xbox Series X bundles are available with throw in extras such as a T-shirt or cap.  But while these options usually cost around £465 right now these bundles are priced at £449.99 - the same price as an Xbox Series X on its own. The restock this week is the first time in awhile that the Xbox Series X is not only widely available, but stock is still available after a few minutes. So if you've been thinking of purchasing Microsoft's in-demand next-gen console then now is the ideal time to do so. Anyone that is buying a Microsoft console for the first time should try out the Xbox Game Pass service. Game Pass - which has been dubbed in some quarters as gaming's version of Netflix - offers a library of hundreds of games you can try out for a monthly subscription fee. If you've never signed up to Xbox Game Pass before you can try out the service for just £1. A Game Pass subscription will give you access to critically acclaimed first-party games such as Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 plus you'll get access to a range of third-party games, some of which arrive on Game Pass on Day One like Devolver Digital's brilliantly stylish Trek to Yomi.
