If you've been thinking about upgrading to the latest iPhone 13 but don't fancy paying the £789 price to own one then it's worth taking a look at the latest deals from Amazon. The online retailer has just launched a new deal that not only slashes the price of this very latest device by £50 but also lets customers pay for things over 12 months. That means you can grab the iPhone 13 with 128GB storage for just £60.75 per month. Along with that offer, there's more good news if you want a device with more storage. That's because Amazon has also cut the cost of the 256GB and 512GB models as well. The iPhone 13 with 256GB of memory now costs £829 or £69.09 per month with the biggest 512GB version available for £1,029 or 85.75 per month - that's a saving of £50 off the standard price from Apple. The deals can be grabbed on colours including Pink, Starlight, Blue and even the new green which launched back in March.

There's also a bigger battery tucked inside for longer life and a new dual-lens camera helps improve photography, especially when shooting in low light conditions. Other extras include a tough Ceramic Sheild design, pin-sharp 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR screen and wireless charging with the iPhone 13 fully compatible with Apple's MagSafe technology. There's also Apple's clever Cinematic mode that adds shallow depth of field and shifts focus automatically in your videos. If spending over £700 on a phone sounds a bit excessive then don't panic as Amazon has also just slashed the price of the older iPhone 12 with prices now starting from just £619 for the 64GB model - that's a £60 saving. Just like the iPhone 13, Amazon also offers the option to pay over an entire year which means you can pop this device in your pocket for just £51.59 per month. As a quick reminder, the iPhone 12 features Apple's A14 Bionic processor, 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display and a dual-lens rear camera. It's also covered in that Ceramic Shield technology which Apple boasts is the strongest glass in smartphone. YOU CAN SEE THE iPHONE 12 DEALS HERE
