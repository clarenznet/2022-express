We have reached the final day of the PGA Championship and England's Matt Fitzpatrick is still in with a shout of glory as he lies three shots behind shock leader Mito Pereira. Tiger Woods, however, will not be in action after he withdrew from the tournament through injury. The legendary figure looked in pain throughout, and speaking after day three shortly before his withdrawal Woods admitted: "I just didn't play well. I didn't hit the ball very well. I'm sore." Fitzpatrick, however, is on -6, while Will Zalatoris, Cameron Young, Abraham Ancer and Seamus Power are also still in a strong position. Fitzpatrick said: "I am looking forward to whatever happens. I have played well for three rounds at least. "I have had the experience of being in the lead before in Europe and a major is completely different. This is my first time being in proper contention so I am looking forward to trying to stay as level as possible." Back to Woods, and Justin Thomas said the 46-year-old's blunt advice helped him to master the challenge of Southern Hills in the wind yesterday. The World No 9 shot his second successive 67 to post a six-under-par clubhouse target after taking to heart a barb from his friend Woods that his golf was not creative enough. “The first time I played competitively with Tiger, I just asked him: ‘What do you see?’ He said: ‘You don't move the ball enough’. For me it was a case of: ‘He's pretty good, he said that, I should probably try it,” said Thomas. “Just being as windy as it was today, there was a lot of manipulating different shots. I played better today than I did yesterday. It was a lot more difficult due to the wind but I made it very easy on myself.   “There’s a lot of golf left but if I keep doing what I’m doing I’m excited for the week.” Thomas, who won the US PGA in 2017 at Quail Hollow, finished off in style, walking in a ten-foot birdie putt at his final hole, the ninth.
