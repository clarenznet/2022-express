An Aries Moon transit invites more bold and forthright energies; vastly contrasting the dreamy Pisces transit we’ve seen over the past two days. Although this might be a slight shock to the system, Mars will also be transiting in Aries today; a sign it feels particularly comfortable in. This will help ease you into the new transit, providing a greater drive to channel the energy to work best in your favour. Express.co.uk reveals your horoscope, star sign reading, astrology and zodiac forecast for May 24. While the Moon is in free flow in a Pisces transit, the Venus-Saturn sextile in the morning will promote more of a pragmatic, considered approach to tasks and social situations. The grounding influence the planet alignment possesses will help stabilise emotions; you might feel a lot more calculated during this period. Cafe Astrology said: “We place a higher value on security, steadiness, and loyalty. “This transit boosts the appeal of the ordinary and reliable – we appreciate longstanding alliances or tried-and-true pleasures.” READ MORE: 'Avoid these shades' Colour psychology expert reveals best room colour  “We are more responsible with others and with our own feelings and affections.” You might take better pride in planning and organising things during this transit, and the tranquil Pisces Moon will bring a good level of calmness to these activities. However, when the Moon heads into bold and assertive Aries at 10.40pm BST, you might feel a bit more dynamic and spirited. Cafe Astrology said: “While this transit only lasts over two days, Mars enters Aries tonight and will stick around until July 5.  “Mars feels exceptionally comfortable in Aries, as it rules the sign.” This means despite the potentially rocky waters the change of vibe might stir, the potent and grounded Mars energy will help steer you through it. This transit will stimulate a greater sense of spontaneity, forward-thinking, and confidence to say or do things you might never have seen for yourself.

We instinctively find the fastest way to get from point A to point B.” However, every planet transit has a shadow side, and in a fiery Aries transit, it can often come in the form of impatience, impulsivity, and a bit more of a temper. Try to tap into the more authentic, innovative, and enthusiastic side of Aries and use them to your advantage today, as the cardinal sign will aid well with any new ventures or ambitions.  Astrology TV said: “An Aries Moon is always a good time for initiating something new. “These energies are also competitive and driven, favouring short bursts of energy rather than long drawn out projects.” Although, as great as the impulsive and forthright energies can be, this can also create new and unnecessary problems. Jumping to conclusions can pose a problem during an Aries Moon transit, so it’s important to avoid rushing into things until you have all the facts.
