They are nothing more than a distraction, as Neil Parish discovered to his cost in his moment of madness. If my boss caught me scrolling through my phone while I was meant to be working I’d be told in no uncertain terms that I should stop skiving and get back to work. And if, like Neil Parish, I’d been caught watching pornography at work it would be a short visit to HR, accompanied by security, as I was sacked and marched out of the building. Brian Metcalfe, Birmingham ----------------------------------------------------------------- Wish I could get paid for playing on phone at work MPs are getting paid to listen to whoever is talking in Parliament, not to play on their phones. I wish I could sit in Parliament and play on my phone or iPad, and get paid for doing so. The Government has the power to stop this malarkey instantly. Kathleen Stone, Rotherham, S Yorks ----------------------------------------------------------------- Watching porn is far more interesting than politics I actually feel sorry for Neil Parish. After all, what a difficult choice he had to make. Watch pornography or watch what was going on in the House of Commons. Tough decision. Keith Woods, Manchester ----------------------------------------------------------------- Some arrogant MPs forget that we pay their wages The use of mobiles, especially ones being used for personal matters including looking up tractors on the internet, is unforgivable. As a taxpayer I do not expect to find any MPs using mobile phones in the chamber. It should have signal blocking technology or MPs surrender their phones on entry. Michael Hill, Lancing, W Sussex
