Priscilla Presley looked stunning as she arrived at the Met Gala 2022 in New York on Monday night. The actress put on a youthful display in a floor-length Prada satin gown. The black ensemble featured corset detailing, which highlighted the 76-year-old's tiny waist, as well as gold jewels adorning her long sleeves. The flame-haired star accessorized with a matching black headband and sparkling pointed gold heels. Priscilla walked the red-carpet with Austin Butler, 30, who plays her late ex-husband Elvis in the highly-anticipated movie. Austin also wore Prada, opting for a black tuxedo with a cropped jacket and silk lapels. The biopic’s director, Baz Luhrmann, joined Priscilla and paid tribute to Elvis in a bedazzled black jacket with turned up collars. The jacket was adorned with red and silver jewels, which the filmmaker paired with matching shoes and a red shirt. Priscilla attended a private screening of the biopic on Friday and gave Baz and Austin a glowing review. She wrote on Facebook: “It is a true story told brilliantly and creatively that only Baz, in his unique artistic way, could have delivered. “Austin Butler, who played Elvis, is outstanding… Bravo to him, he knew he had big shoes to fill."
