Boris Johnson will visit Northern Ireland on Monday as a political crisis engulfs Stormont and the UK continues to lock horns with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Prime Minister said earlier this week that the Northern Ireland Protocol has become a "real problem" and must be "fixed" to ensure the country can agree a new power-sharing administration. A delegation of US congressmen and women will fly to London in just days to warn the Government to continue negotiations with the EU.  The US has waded into the debate and has urged all parties to continue negotiations over the protocol to safeguard the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. A White House spokesperson said earlier this week: ”The best path forward is a pragmatic one that requires courage, cooperation, and leadership. "We urge the parties to continue engaging in dialogue to resolve differences and bring negotiations to a successful conclusion." So is the US right to wade in on the crisis, or should the UK tell Biden where to go over Brexit orders on Northern Ireland?
