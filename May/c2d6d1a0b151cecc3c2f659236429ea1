YouTube and Channel 4 has announced a landmark and innovative deal that will see hundreds of hours of TV available to watch online for free. In a first of its kind deal, full episodes of Channel 4 and E4 hits such as Location, Location, Location, SAS: Who Dares Wins and 8 Out Of 10 Cats will be made available to watch entirely for free on YouTube. And, unlike BBC iPlayer, you won't need a TV license to watch this content. Channel 4 programming will be available to watch on YouTube across the UK and Ireland, with the deal allowing the broadcaster to sell its own advertising around these shows. By the end of this year a whopping 1,000 hours of Channel 4 and E4 shows will be available to watch on YouTube, with content from the broadcaster starting to appear on the Google-owned platform from this month. Among the shows that will be available to watch on YouTube are 8 Out Of 10 Cats, SAS: Who Dares Wins, Nikki Grahame: Who Is She?, Unapologetic, Gemma Collins: Self-Harm and Me, Davina McCall’s Language of Love, Kathy Burke: Money Talks, The Dog House, Devon & Cornwall and Location, Location, Location.  Speaking about the news Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, said: "Innovative strategic partnerships are Channel 4’s speciality, and this new relationship with YouTube is another which will ensure we continue to keep growing our reach with young audiences and build on our unrivalled digital success. "Together with YouTube we have created a powerful consumer channel full of our brilliant Channel 4 content. This will engage even more viewers through the enhanced reach and digital scale of YouTube, combined with the dynamism of the Channel 4 brand."  While Ben McOwen Wilson, the managing director of YouTube for UK and Ireland, added: "I'm proud to welcome Channel 4's creative, thought-provoking long form content on to the YouTube platform. "As an open platform, YouTube is where UK audiences of all ages and backgrounds come to watch what they want to watch, when they want to watch it. It is fantastic to drive innovative partnerships such as this, to enable leading broadcasters to contribute to the diversity of content on the platform of choice for young viewers."
