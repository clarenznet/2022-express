Mohamed Salah and Heung-min Son will share the 2021/22 Premier League Golden Boot after finishing up on 23 goals following two outstanding individual seasons with Liverpool. The pair were both on target on the final day of the campaign as Salah took a one-goal lead into the final 90 minutes of play.  Son, who netted twice in Tottenham's 5-0 drubbing of Norwich, looked set to steal the accolade from the Egyptian's clutches before he struck a second for Liverpool in their 3-1 win over Wolves. The South Korean international helped wrap up Spurs' place in next season's Champions League as Antonio Conte's men ran riot at Carrow Road. It's been another remarkable campaign from Son, who played an integral role in Tottenham's revival under Conte to drive them into fourth place. Salah has been the runaway leader since the beginning of the season but his form deteriorated following his return from the African Cup of Nations.
