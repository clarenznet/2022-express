An investigation is underway after the intruder tricked his way into the Coldstream Guards officers' mess by claiming to be a priest. The man, who is believed to have mental health problems, spent the night eating, drinking and telling tall tales about his "service in Iraq". He even claimed to have been an ejector seat test pilot with G-force resistant internal organs. The imposter was given a bed for the night and breakfast. Police were called when the soldiers finally became suspicious and the man was taken away but he was not arrested. The extraordinary breach of security happened last Tuesday at Victoria Barracks in Windsor - a short distance from the castle. The intruder had spent 16 hours there. The Army is taking the incident "extremely seriously" as police and military prepare for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee next month. Sources said the officers who had entertained the man and the soldiers who had let him in "could be disciplined". One source commented: "The guy turned up at the gate, said his name was Father Cruise and claimed to be a friend of the battalion's padre, Rev Matt Coles. He was invited in and offered something to eat." "Within a couple of hours, he was drinking with officers in the bar. He was telling lots of tall stories and the lads were enjoying his banter." "It was only later when he started talking about how he had worked as an ejector-seat test pilot and had some of his organs replaced that the chaps started to get suspicious." A spokesman said: "The Army takes this breach of security extremely seriously and it will be thoroughly investigated." The Queen's hopes of winning the Epsom Derby in her Jubilee year ended after her horse Reach For The Moon was withdrawn yesterday.
