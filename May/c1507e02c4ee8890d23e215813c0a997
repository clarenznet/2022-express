Leonid Vasyukevich, a communist lawmaker from the Khabarovsky Krai in the far east of Siberia urged Putin to end the conflict in Ukraine. He said: "During a military operation, people become disabled. These are young people who could be of great use to our country." The local deputy added: "We demand an immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops." His appeal was backed by lawmaker Leonid Vasyukevich, who warned: "If our country does not halt the military operation then there will be even more orphans in our country." Their remarks followed the surprising condemnation of the war by Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, on Wednesday. Through a letter in which he wrote he was "ashamed" of his country and called the invasion a "disaster", he became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce Moscow's assaults.
