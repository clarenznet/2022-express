Netflix’s biggest budget production ever is coming this summer in The Gray Man. The $200 million movie follows Ryan Gosling as the title character, Court Gentry aka Sierra Six, a CIA black ops mercenary forced to go on the run after he uncovers incriminating secrets.  As a result, he becomes the target of a worldwide manhunt led by his psychopathic former colleague Lloyd Hansen, played by Chris Evans. Avengers Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo are helming Netflix’s most expensive movie to date, being reunited with Captain America star Evans. Joining the all-star cast are No Time To Die’s Ana de Armas and next Bond favourite Regé-Jean-Page. The new blockbuster is based on Jack Ryan novelist Mark Greaney’s The Gray Man book series. The Gray Man hits select UK cinemas on July 15, 2022 and will be available to stream on Netflix from July 22, 2022.
