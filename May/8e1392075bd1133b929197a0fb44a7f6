Nadine Dorries, 65, took to Twitter to respond to Andrew Neil, 73, after the veteran political journalist spent part of his Channel 4 show spitting bars about Boris Johnson's Government. The Brexit-backing Mid Bedfordshire MP even suggested a certain award-winning rapper would not be losing sleep following Mr Neil's performance. Ms Dorries said: "Nicki Minaj won’t be losing any sleep tonight." Ms Minaj, known for hits such as Anaconda and Starships, found herself at odds with the UK Government last year over the COVID-19 vaccine. However, Dorries' post, which was uploaded to Twitter at 11.01pm, was attached to a video clip of Mr Neil's own attempt at rapping. During the video, Mr Neil said: "I'm here to present the Andrew Neil Show. JUST IN: 'Not a Brexit Government!' Boris eviscerated for failing Britons as Labour storm ahead "I'm on the mic, so get with the flow. "Top politicians here on C4. It's just half an hour but they all want more. "I ask all the questions like I just don't care. "So, come on Boris and get in the chair. Mr Neil rounded off his rap with his own mic-drop moment after he said: "Thanks, Nadine, nailed it." Ms Dorries spat with the Channel 4 host comes shortly after she updated MPs about the planned privatisation of the TV channel. Despite only amassing 2,067 followers, the Culture Secretary's Online Safety Bill TikTok was watched by over 17,000 users. The clip saw Ms Dorries rap about "the UK is passing some new legislation, to make the internet safer for the younger generation". The ex-'I'm a Celebrity' contestant has made several other TikToks documenting her time as Culture Secretary.
