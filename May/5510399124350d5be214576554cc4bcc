The frisky couple, who were just metres away from the coast path and in full view of diners at Hooked on the Rocks restaurant, did not have any reservations about being seen. The "hilarious" incident occurred yesterday in Swanpool, Cornwall at around 1.30pm. Photos captured by a diner show the couple mid-embrace as people stroll along the footpath just feet away, reports Cornwall Live. The amused diner who snapped the picture said: “We noticed a very happy couple at Swanpool Falmouth, on the cliff top. "We were at Hooked on the Rocks – all the customers were rather shocked and found it hilarious. It must have been the humidity.  “One couple I think were a bit annoyed, but the rest of us found it hilarious. An older couple in their 70s were cracking us all up. They couldn't take their eyes off them. "At first sight we thought probably yoga but then my partner zoomed in on her phone and confirmed what we all really thought they were doing. “My partner was shocked at how long they were going. They were still at it when we left.” Flocking to Cornwall Live's Facebook page, many people saw the funny side. One person commented: "Well where do you expect people to do it when housing is so expensive?" Another wrote: "Dinner with a show, Cornwall has it all!" While a third said: "I was conceived on a beach, Christmas Eve in Kent so it must have been very cold. That was Christmas 1946! It’s always happened, nothing much has changed."
