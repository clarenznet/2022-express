The Swedish ambassador to the UK explained what an 'epic' moment it was for her country. Sweden and Finland have confirmed that they will be joining NATO despite intimidation from Russia. Ms Kumlin Granit explained that it had been a political tradition for Sweden not to align militarily. The Swedish ambassador also discussed Sweden entering a new era in terms of military defence. Ms Kumlin Ganit said: "Yes I cannot underline enough how historic, I would nearly even use the word epic for this decision. "Sweden has been conducting the policy of military non-alignment for over 200 years. "And this is something that is deeply rooted in our political identity, and for many of our most important political parties, it has also been a political tradition. "So even though we've taken incremental steps to international corporations, we're not with the decision leaving an era of non-alignment and entering a completely new one."

Putin has been using the threat of nuclear action to try and keep Western countries from interfering in his ongoing invasion of Ukraine. READ MORE:'I felt sick!'
