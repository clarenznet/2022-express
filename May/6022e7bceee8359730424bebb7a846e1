NI increased 1.25 percent in April on top of soaring inflation, energy bills and the general cost of living. But what does the National Insurance rise mean for the average employee? While National Insurance has now hit 13.25 percent for millions of taxpayers this year lower earners will be exempt from paying NI. The new rates will apply to people earning between £184 and £967 a week but not everyone will end up paying the same. Last month Rishi Sunak increased the threshold that National Insurance would have to be paid in a bid to help people through the cost of living crisis. From July, people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying any income tax or National Insurance.

He said: “Alongside the inflation and the rising costs of utility bills, the new tax will impact even further the pockets of millions of workers across the UK.” However, not everyone will be worse off and ‘average’ earners could be better off.

Somebody on a £50,000 yearly wage will pay an extra £197, whereas those on a £100,000 annual pay will see their National Insurance increase by £822. One way to make savings is to consider salary sacrifice which could help workers who are paying a high NI rate. Mr Smith explained: “Salary sacrifice gives employees the chance to contribute to their pension from their gross pay. “Hence, salary sacrifice can mitigate costs for both businesses and workers. “Not only will companies decrease their National Insurance contributions, but they could also increase how much their employees take home every month.” What is happening where you live?
