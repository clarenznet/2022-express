Helen Mirren looked ageless and radiant as she and pal Andie MacDowell twirled, held hands and grinned broadly in each other's presence. The pair attended the screening at the Palais des Festivals, where the Cannes Film Festival has entered its 75th year. Helen dressed to impress in a sparkly silver sequined floor length gown, paired with a classic pair of black heels. She swept her long white hair into a ponytail, which she swished around on the red carpet for dramatic effect. Meanwhile Four Weddings and a Funeral star Andie wore a vintage style bouffant gown with brown and white stripe detailing, and let her salt-and-pepper natural curls hang loose for the occasion. She had previously spoken of how much she loves being a "silver fox". The pair had previously starred together in 2021's On The Edge and looked to be enjoying each other's company enormously as they had a catch-up. Meanwhile, there's good news for Helen as it has just been announced that she has been cast in the Yellowstone prequel series 1932, with fellow acting giant Harrison Ford.
