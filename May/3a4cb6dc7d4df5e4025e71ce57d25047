The mouth is one of the most vital organs in the body and can also be an indicator when something is not quite right. Unusual tastes in the mouth could be directly linked to a failing heart, warn experts. Having an interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy the heart muscle. The majority of the time, the blood flow is restricted due to a build-up of fat and cholesterol – forming a plaque. Paying attention to the warning signs you’re in need of medical attention is crucial. Dr Mark Perlroth said: “Heart attacks sometimes mimic simple health conditions, such as indigestion, so it’s important to know the difference between these and other conditions.” Heartburn-like symptoms can be from a heart attack. This may cause foul breath and a sour, acidic, or metallic taste in the mouth. Doctors Hospital lists the lesser-known sign on its website stating “chronic or severe indigestion without burping, belching, heartburn, nausea or sour taste in the mouth". A heart attack occurs when blood flow through a coronary artery is suddenly obstructed, depriving the vital organ of oxygen-rich nutrients. There are different possible causes for this obstruction, but generally, a blood clot causes a sudden blockage. The most immediate evidence of the cells in the heart dying is a sharp pain in the chest. Other warning signs of a heart attack include: The first thing you must do is dial 999 immediately for an ambulance, advises the British Heart Foundation. The site added: “Don’t worry if you’re not completely sure whether your symptoms are a heart attack, it’s really important that you seek medical attention regardless as quickly as possible.” The health site advises to then: Sit down and rest Take a 300mg aspirin if you have one within arm’s reach Stay calm and wait for the paramedics.
