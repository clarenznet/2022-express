Shingles is a reaction to the same virus as chickenpox. There are several signs which may indicate the condition with the most common being a rash. The condition could have major health consequences but a right diet could help significantly. Studies suggest that a constant disruption in the acid-base balance causes chronic metabolic acidosis which could further exacerbate shingles. Such continuous high acidity in the body could cause a predisposition to some diseases in the long run. While most of our diet is made up of things with generally low acidity, there are several foods and drinks that are high enough in acid to cause a problem. Examples of acidic foods include: Foods that have been found to exacerbate shingles should be avoided where possible. “The worst culprits contain the amino acid arginine that actually stimulates the herpes virus to replicate, such as, nuts, seeds, soy products, oats, coconut, flour (white and whole-wheat), and alas, chocolate,” reports La Jolla Light. It also recommends reducing the amount of alcohol consumed as it can negatively affect the body’s immune responses. “Also, steer clear of extreme temperatures in foods like scalding soups or icy treats that are jarring to the nervous system.” Less acidic choices include broccoli, bell peppers and cabbage. Leafy greens provide a shot of Vitamin D to ward off invading viruses, while pomegranates and blueberries are dual-purpose weapons protecting cells from oxidation, along with revving up your immune system’s disease-fighting soldiers. One of the most potent shingles busters can be found in foods brimming with lysine, an amino acid that puts the skids on the cellular growth of the zoster virus. Foods rich in lysine include:
