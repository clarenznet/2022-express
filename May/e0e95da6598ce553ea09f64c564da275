Richarlison threw a flair back into the crowd after opening the scoring for Everton against Chelsea on Sunday. The Brazilian capitalised on a mistake from Blues skipper Cesar Azpilicueta to score a vital goal for Frank Lampard's side. The strike cued jubilant celebrations at Goodison Park as the Toffees received a huge boost in their bid to stave off relegation from the Premier League. A blue flair was launched onto the pitch from the crowd in the aftermath of the goal. And after celebrating with his team-mates, Richarlison picked up the flair, ran a few metres and then threw it back from where it came from. The referee did not punish the forward but he could face FA action following his wild celebration. It was a feisty encounter on Merseyside, with five yellow cards being handed out in the first half, including three for the visitors. It was an even opening 45 minutes but less than 90 seconds into the second half, Everton were ahead.

And he hit out at Azpilicueta's role in the goal. Osman said: "It is a gift from Azpilicueta. Richarlison presses him and he thinks he's got so much time when he hasn't. "He takes far too long; Demarai Gray is on hand to feed Richarlison who strokes it home. Chelsea were sloppy first half and that has continued." Former Everton left-back Andy Hinchcliffe also praised Richarlison for winning the ball back off Chelsea. He said on Sky Sports: "Richarlison should never have been able to close him down and gain possession. It's a cool finish."

However, the Ukraine left-back fired over when in on goal. Chelsea then started to dominate proceedings and Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was called upon to pull off a couple of stunning saves. Everton went into the match in 18th place in the table, five points from safety, after Burnley turned it around to beat Watford on Saturday. Meanwhile, Chelsea were attempting to solidify third spot.
