Eva Longoria, 47, looked mesmerizing in a sheer black gown as she took to the red carpet this evening. The sweeping gown featured a ruffled skirt, sequins and thin straps. Its sheerness showed off the actress's taut abs and toned pins as she strutted on the catwalk. The dress also featured a plunging neckline, showing off her ample assets. She teamed the gown with a black diamond choker and a pair of black stiletto heels. Her signature tresses were also swept back as she left waved pieces either side of her face, complimenting her gown. The Desperate Housewives star also highlighted her youthful complexion with a soft makeup palette, paired with dark eyeliner. Eva was one of the first to jet into the French resort for the annual event, having been seen standing on a balcony at the Martinez Hotel last night. The actress went braless in a figure-hugging silver dress which gathered at the front to create a unique texture. Taking to her Instagram Stories, the star posed for a picture on the balcony, catching the golden light as the sun set, captioning the post: "Hello my sweet Cannes." After Cannes was entirely cancelled in 2020 and held under strict health protocols in 2021, the red carpet returned in all its glamour this evening.
