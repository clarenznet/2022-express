In a new interview, Jane explained: “My husband, the French Russian film director, Roger Vadim directed it and Terry Southern wrote the script [For Barbarella]. “The President Of The United States has assigned Barbarella, that’s moi, the task of landing her spacecraft on the evil planet which has been taken over by a terrible scientist. However, the actress admitted having “complicated feelings” towards the movie that saw her become an international star. She continued: “I’ve complicated feelings about the film, see what I just said was the President Of The United States chose Barbarella to fly her spaceship, which she did all by herself, to the planet, so that is kind of feminist, right?

Jane went on: “So I had a little problem with the film because right after the film I left my husband and came to the United States and slowly became a feminist. “So I kind of for a while rejected the film Barbarella," she told Glamour magazine. Jane made her professional debut in 1960 on Broadway and on screen, and she went on to become one of the biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s with films like 1968's Barbarella and 1971's Klute. She is also one of the most decorated actresses in Golden Globes history as she has earned 15 nominations throughout her career and has won seven including in 1962 for Tall Story, 1972 for Klute, 1978 for Julia, and 1979 for Coming Home.
