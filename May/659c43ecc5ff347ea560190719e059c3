The footage was taken at around 9.40am on Sunday (May 22) and appears to show a man wheeling two suitcases down the busy A555 in Greater Manchester as cars speed past him. The video was captured by a taxi driver after he dropped off passengers at nearby Manchester Airport. The 38-year-old, who did not wish to give his name, said the sight left him feeling bewildered. According to the Manchester Evening News, the witness said: "I was heading away from the airport towards the M56 and I thought, ‘What is this person doing?’ "I just couldn’t believe it. It’s just not something you expect to see on the live motorway – there were cars going past him at 60mph. How can you not twig that you’re in the place you’re not supposed to be when you have cars whizzing past you? And where are you going to go with all the suitcases on the carriageway? "It was absolutely mind-boggling; human stupidity has no bounds. "Obviously he’s just arrived from somewhere and is trying to find someone. I reckon he must have been expecting someone to pick him up and they arranged a place to avoid paying the pick-up fee and got the wrong end of the stick.   "I’m a taxi driver and I’m at the airport five times a day and the lengths people are willing to go to avoid paying the pickup and drop-off charge is mind-boggling. They’re being dropped off at roundabouts and in the middle of the road. I’ve seen people reversing down the one-way ramp to avoid the fee. I’ve seen it all. "I was going to pull over and tell him he’s putting himself in danger but he gave me the look and I could see cars coming behind me and I didn’t want to cause more problems." The A555 connects Manchester Airport in the west to Stockport in the east of the county.
