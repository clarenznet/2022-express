Ninety per cent of these migrants appear to be young men in their twenties and thirties. We do not know where they come from or their religious affiliation. Some have trashed their documents and been filmed throwing mobile phones overboard. We really do not want to risk more jihadi imports. ---------- Leo McKinstry is certainly right about the useless Police and Crime Commissioners, says Roy Daniels, from Luton, Beds. Like so many other Government initiatives, such as NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups, it was a good idea, poorly implemented. The concept was to encourage local candidates to run for election, to ensure local policing priorities were implemented. But instead, I suspect failed party hacks were parachuted in to follow party-political agendas, as was arguably the case in the unequal treatment by the Met and Durham police over the lockdown "infringements" by Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer. ---------- I don't agree with the way Environment Secretary George Eustice put it, or his apparent lack of empathy with those suffering during this cost of living crisis, but he does have a point about buying brand names, says Ashley Smith, from March, Cambs. Take the example of spaghetti. A top brand is more than £1 a pack, but a supermarket's own label could be as little as 20p and both are 100 per cent durum wheat. ---------- The usual suspects are in favour of a windfall tax on BP following its record profits, says Christopher Humphreys, from Ewloe, Flint. Before we all rush to agree, we need to know at what rate the tax will be paid, how it will be spent and what happens when that money, as it surely will, runs out. As Margaret Thatcher once said: "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."
