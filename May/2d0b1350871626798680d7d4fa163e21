Russian state TV has hosted a panel show discussing Russia's war in Ukraine and the role of NATO in supporting Kyiv. A guest spoke out at western involvement in what Vladimir Putin has described as a "special military operation" by Russia against its southern neighbour. "I believe the special military operation is entering a new phase Ukrainians alone are no longer enough. "Now they are talking about NATO countries supplying de-facto their own weapons. "We'll see not only NATO's weapons being drawn into this but also their operators. "De-facto we're starting to wage war against NATO countries. "We'll be grinding up NATO's war machine as well as citizens of NATO countries. "When this operation concludes NATO will have to ask itself 'do we have what we need to defend ourselves?' "'Do we have the people to defend ourselves?' And there will be no mercy." He continued: "Not only Ukraine will have to be de-nazified. "The war against Europe and the world is developing a more specific outline which means we'll have to act differently and to act much more harshly." The guest had earlier branded Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky a "devil" and "Satan" in a bizarre rant. Addressing the Ukrainian President, the Russian political pundit blasted: "I condemn you Zelensky with an anathema. "You're not a jew, you're not a believer you're a pure, cheap devil. "You're the devil and your slaves are tiny devils. "You need to be chased, not negotiated with." "You've shown Russian orthodox warriors we're fighting not only Nazis but the devils "Your satanic Nazi Government is the godless enemy of Ukraine."
