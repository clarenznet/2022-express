Away from the soap, Liam Fox and his co-star wife Joanna Hudson, who played Ross Barton's (played by Michael Parr) doctor, live in a fairytale property together, with beautiful lilac wisteria growing on its facade. Plus, while Liam, whose character was branded "Desperate Dan", has had a turbulent love life on TV, in reality, he and Joanne appear to be blissfully content. Their red brick house might not be a Hollywood mansion, but it's a place of laughs and smiles for the pair, by the looks of the Instagram updates they post from it. Liam and Joanne, who starred in Emmerdale in 2018, enjoy maximising their outdoor space by lounging in their landscaped back garden - and they have an outdoor sofa and BBQ too. The pair cook in a stylish open plan kitchen and chill afterwards on their crushed velvet sofa. Sometimes, however, as these photos show, they're equally content to lie outstretched on mats and watch TV on the floor.
