GBNews presenter Dan Wootton took to Twitter to mock photos released by Sue Gray following the conclusion of her Partygate investigation. He noted that there was no booze, no cake and just "a bunch of crusty M&S sandwiches".      He said: "So here’s the birthday 'gathering' Labour think should bring down our democratically elected Prime Minister (and his Chancellor). "No booze. No cake. Certainly no beer or curry. A bunch of crusty M&S sandwiches and everyone socially distanced. Can the country move on now please?"  Many other Twitter users agreed with Mr Wootton. Tyler said: "Nope that ain’t no party … Looks more and more like a work meeting." Another, named Alan Lyons, said: "I've read the report. Absolutely nothing to see. This is over. On to beer."  Others claimed the event looked too boring to be a considered a party-party. One user, Annie H, said: "Presumably as there was no work involved? But it's still pretty lame, they are all stood apart, looks like most awkward work 'dos' I've attended, certainly not a party!" Not everyone was ready to let the Prime Minister off the hook. Several Twitter users vented their outrage at the report. Clive Roper said: "You miss the point, it was illegal and they set the rules that most of us adhered to."
