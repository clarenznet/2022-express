The men tried desperately to shovel their car out of the sand and gravel just above the tide line yesterday on Swanpool Beach in Falmouth. They had parked there on Saturday, ignoring signs which ask people not to drive any vehicle onto the shingle. The car park is just on the other side of the road, less than 20 metres from the water’s edge. Mark Moseley, an engineer who was driving past yesterday, stopped to help the tourists, who'd travelled more than 250 miles from Guildford, Surrey, reports Cornwall Live. Mark, 54, said: "There was another guy who was about to drive onto the beach to try and pull them free but I told him not to bother as I have a big 4x4 and he would have got stuck too. I’ve never done beach rescues like this before but I’ve helped people out of ditches and the like before so I have all the kit in the car. "They were lucky to have backed their car just above the tide line and that the sea didn’t cover it or push it further back. "The two blokes said they came last night and couldn’t be bothered carrying their kayak from the car park to the sea so they decided to back the car onto the beach even though there is a sign that asks people not to drive any vehicle onto the beach. Guess what? They had got stuck all night." Mark, who is a grandfather of four, was able to get the vehicle free within minutes. But other locals weren't impressed with the tourists' behaviour. Three cars - all BMWs - got stuck on the same beach last year. Mark, who builds engines for a living, continued: "The funniest thing is that the lady in the café off the beach said she saw three cars stuck on the beach in the same spot last year - all BMWs. Maybe it’s a BMW thing. "She even called the police to report the vehicle stolen but I think it was just two harmless guys who didn’t quite realise what they were doing and that they’d get stuck on the beach all night."
