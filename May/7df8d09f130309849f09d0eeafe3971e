The technology, which recognises fluid in the lungs, had an 80 percent success rate of detecting the condition worsening. In heart failure patients, the blood is not pumped around the body as it should be. Fluid is not eliminated properly and excess builds up in the lungs or legs. Professor William Abraham, from the Ohio State University in Columbus, said: “Current care isn’t good enough for keeping patients with heart failure well and out of the hospital. “In our study, a voice analysis app was able to predict most cases of worsening heart failure well in advance with very few false alarms.” Some 180 patients were tracked for 512 days and 49 heart issues occurred in 37 patients with 80 percent noted. True alerts were issued an average of 21 days before symptoms appeared.
