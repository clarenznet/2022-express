Forecasters say sudden heavy downpours will return for a second day - the result of pressure from the North Atlantic stream. On Tuesday afternoon, London was blasted by the sudden storm, which included thunder, lightning, and hail. And, according to Jim Dale, senior meteorologist at British Weather Services, the northwest will feel the brunt of the weather today. He told Express.co.uk: “We will see another day of threatening showers as ‘cumulonimbus’ clouds, thunderclouds, are observed.” Cumulonimbus clouds are menacing looking multi-level clouds, extending high into the sky in towers or plumes. They are the only clouds which can produce hail, thunder and lightning.

He noted: “We missed the April showers, we didn’t get them really for the most part. “And so we've got them in May instead. “Which is not unusual - we get the heat of the sun at this time of year but when we get in low pressure, that produces the showery activity. “And sometimes it can be quite manifest.” DON'T MISS: Urgent warning issued to convertible driversUK storm forecast: 'Mini tornado' warning issuedUK storm warning: 150MPH jet stream to unleash 48 HOURS of rain Netweather's forecast also shows today’s weather to be “particularly unsettled”, with heavy rain in places crosses all parts from the West followed by “blustery showers”.
