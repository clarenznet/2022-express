Amber Heard called ex-husband Johnny Depp a “washed up piece of s***” and a “joke” in recordings played in court today as she continues to be cross-examined on the stand. The Aquaman actress could be heard laughing at Johnny, telling him to “be a man”. Several lengthy recordings were played in court, in which Amber could be heard calling Johnny a “lying piece of s***,” a “sellout”, a “joke,” and “washed up”. She repeatedly says “suck my d***” and tells Johnny to “go run away” and “be a man”. Amber laughs at Johnny in the clip, taunting him about his age. “You’re a joke. You’re a joke,” she says. Black Mass star Johnny replies: “Yeah, I’m the joke in the industry. I’m the joke.” He adds: “Your jealousy is so tragic.” In another recording played in court, Johnny tells Amber his son Jack was “freaked out” after she “screamed at Johnny” in front of him. “That f***ed him up, you know,” says Johnny. “You’re right Johnny. I’m sorry I f****d your son up,” Amber replies. “I am so sorry I f****d your kids up.” Johnny tells her: “You didn’t f*** my kids up, but it was pretty f***ing weird for him.” Amber replies: “Because I jumped up and screamed…. I’m sure that’s terrifying. Poor kid.” DON'T MISS... Rebekah Vardy was 'more interested in taking selfies' than football [INSIGHT]Jane McDonald sobbed in restaurant amid late fiancé's gesture [ADMISSION]Elon Musk on how Amber Heard ‘hurt’ him: ‘In severe emotional pain’ [LATEST] She goes on to tell Johnny she hopes Jack’s new stepfather can teach him “how to be a man” because Johnny couldn’t. Amber has been cross-examined today by Johnny’s lawyer Camilla Vasquez. Vasquez accused Amber of editing photos of her facial injuries after alleged abuse from Johnny, to make them look more prominent. Amber denied editing photos and testified that there were two photos of the same injury which looked different from each other because the light was turned on in one, not because one had been altered. Vasquez also pointed out to Amber that when she called the police to her and Johnny’s home in May 2016, alleging he had beat her, officers testified they noticed no injuries on her. Johnny denies any allegations of abuse, and claimed earlier on in the trial that he has “never hit a woman”. The actor is suing Amber for $50million over a 2018 op ed in the Washington Post, in which she claimed to be a survivor of domestic abuse. He claims he was the implied abuser and that it lost him work, including his famous role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The trial continues.
