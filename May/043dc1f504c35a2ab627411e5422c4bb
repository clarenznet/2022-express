I have worked in a surgery for more than 30 years and I have never seen things as bad. Morale is very low, doctors and nurses are "up and against it" from the moment we switch on the phone at 8am, until 6.30pm. Most doctors have already started work long before 8am and can work late into the night, as there is not enough time in the day to deal with all the administrative tasks. The Government needs to address this urgently as GPs are leaving in droves and there are not many waiting to fill their shoes. ---------- Boris Johnson may well have expected the mauling the Conservatives received in the local elections, says Ashley Smith, from March, Cambs. But, after his failure to address the Northern Ireland protocol sufficiently, then the Partygate scandal and the cost of living crisis, the Prime Minister didn't get a bloody nose in the polls, he got an absolute beating, a beating that could get much worse for the state of our Union. ---------- Is it any wonder GPs can't cope when our population has grown by more than eight million in the last 20 years?, asks Dick Waring, from Fareham, Hants. Our hospitals, schools, prisons and housing have not kept pace with these numbers, to the point where we just can't cope. These things should have been addressed years ago instead of being swept under the carpet. ---------- I hope the Government's media office is monitoring how much news coverage time on Sir Keir Starmer's Beergate there is on the BBC and the other channels in comparison to how much was devoted to Boris Johnson's Partygate, says Rod Williams, from Great Holland, Essex. My guess is it will be a fraction - no more than 10 per cent. ---------- So let us get this straight, are the British people OK with Boris Johnson sending £3billion of our money to fund a proxy war with Russia ("PM: Send more weapons", May 9), while we have our own people here worrying when they'll next eat or have the heating on?, asks David Daniels, from Telford, Salop.
