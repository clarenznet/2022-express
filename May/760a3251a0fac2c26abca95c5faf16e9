Many shoppers slammed the product as they claimed it wastes unnecessary plastic. Nick Alchin explained: "So it's literally a bunch of sliced fruit in a plastic box, labelled for a drink. "(That will have gone off by the time you try and use it).  "Marketing team need to be fired." Another user, Ryan McMaster, said: "OR buy a whole lemon, a whole cucumber and a whole grapefruit, and have 10x as much for half the money." Another one, Bluue Taylor, commented: "For that price it would be stupid to not just do it yourself." "If only fruit came in its own natural biodegradable packaging...." Rosemarie Thomas commented. Kayley Saunders said: "Save money buy the whole fruit also less unnecessary plastic!!" Another ASDA shopper, Pam Fretwell, commented: "The world has gone mad. "Would be so much cheaper to buy your own fruit and chop them up. "The world is getting so lazy!" However, some other shoppers liked the new ASDA party product with Charlie-Ann Keen saying: "Not a bad shout if you’re having a last-minute picnic with Pimm's and won’t have a way of cutting stuff yourself." Emma Hall praised: "For somebody who struggles to use a knife and chop stuff this is brilliant." Maraied Murray-kemp added: "These are yum in ice cold lemonade."
