Many customers do not realise that shopping in a Tesco Express or Sainsbury's Local is costing them more. In a checklist released on Tuesday, Which? said customers spend on average £279 more a year on groceries at a Tesco Express rather than a regular supermarket and £322 more at a Sainsbury's Local. The consumer organisation analysed the average price of 48 items in February 2021, highlighting the research again this week in a series of new cost cutting measures for customers. Data analysts at Kantar predict the average food bill could rise by £271 a year, revealing that current grocery prices are 5.9% higher than they were in April last year - the biggest increase since December 2011, reports The Manchester Evening News. Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said: "Rising food prices and the cost of living crisis are putting huge pressure on household budgets at the moment, and no one wants to overpay for food. "Shopping around and buying own-brand products is an easy way to save hundreds of pounds a year, as is avoiding expensive convenience stores if you can. "Those prepared to switch to a cheaper supermarket for their regular shop will likely find some great value alternatives to their favourite brands." Speaking last year about the issue, Sainsbury’s said: “We’re committed to offering our customers the best possible value. The price of our products is influenced by a range of factors, including promotions, which can vary between Sainsbury’s supermarkets and convenience stores.” Tesco said: “Our Tesco Express stores are mainly in built-up areas where, unfortunately, rents, rates and the operating costs for these stores are higher. “The difference in prices of some products reflect these increased costs, but our prices remain competitive as we strive to offer great value to our customers.”  Here are four other ways to cut costs on your supermarket shop, as revealed by Which? consumer magazine:
