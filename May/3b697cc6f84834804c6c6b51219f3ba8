Kylie Minogue, 53, stunned in a white flowing gown as she attended the event in France. The singer rocked the white satin dress, which featured a single strap. On the other side was a long sleeved arm with the material crossing over in the middle of the dress. She accessorised the white gown with knee high heeled boots and a pair of large black shades. The star wore her signature blonde tresses in a light wave as she strutted into the Magnum Party. Kylie also went for a light makeup palette and a glossy lip, not taking attention away from her impactful but simple dress. Yesterday, the Loco-Motion singer was spotted at the airport in a light tanned Gucci jacket, teamed with a white hat and ripped jeans. She teamed the jacket with a printed shirt and thin strappy heels. Kylie is set to return to Neighbours after 34 years with her onscreen husband Jason Donovan, after the news the show was being cancelled. The young couple's wedding on Neighbours was watched by two million Australians on July 1, 1987.
