Coleen Rooney has begun giving evidence as the libel trial between herself and Rebekah Vardy continues today at London’s High Court.     Coleen replied: "No that's not my intention at all. I wouldn't ever, it's not in my nature to cause abuse or trolling in any way at all." When asked if she would have tried to mitigate any abuse with a post, Coleen replied: "Maybe I would have liked to have said that, but I have never been in a court, I have never been in a legal case before, this is the first time I have gone under instruction of my legal team." Coleen said that she tried to “resolve the matter amicably”. However, she says that she felt her “efforts were all in vain”.
