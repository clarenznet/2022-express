Poppy Delevingne pulled out all the stops as she turned up at the screening for the film Three Thousand Years Of Longing in a stunning, jaw-dropping gown. The model, 36, looked every inch red carpet ready as she attended the glitzy event in the metallic number at the Cannes Film Festival.  The sister of actress and model Cara Delevingne smiled and waved as she flashed her leg while posing professionally for snaps. Poppy donned a gorgeous silver gown which perfectly showcased her incredible figure. The halter-neck design skimmed the floor and featured a daringly-high slit up one side, revealing one perfectly toned pin. She paired the metallic gown with a pair of strappy silver heels and glitzy earrings. Her blonde tresses fell down her back in soft curls and she wore a full-face of soft, natural-looking makeup.
