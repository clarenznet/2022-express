The shop, called Master Chef on Oldham Road in Failsworth, Oldham, Greater Manchester, was immediately closed after the routine inspection visit and the owner, Abdul Ahad, 53, was charged. Inspectors from the Oldham Council visited the shop on December 2, 2020, and they found the infestation. According to the inspectors, dozens of the insects were spread “throughout the shop”, including on the serving counter and on sticky boards. The staff from the council found dirt across the flooring of the shop, as well as on the equipment used. They also reported that there was nothing for staff to dry their hands with at the hand basin. The owner and the business were charged with two offences under Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013. One of the charges was related to the filthy conditions, while the other one was about the cockroach infestation. On May 19, 2022 at Tameside Magistrates Court guilty pleas were entered for all charges. Ahad and the business were ordered to hand over a total of £1,934. Master Chef Failsworth was ordered to pay a £600 fine and costs of £550.
