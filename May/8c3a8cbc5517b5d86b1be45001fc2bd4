Naga Munchetty's longstanding colleague Dan Walker fronted his final show as he bowed out of the programme after six years. The former Football Focus host has left BBC Breakfast to become Channel 5's news anchor and will also host other programmes on the channel. The 45-year-old has been inundated with leaving messages on social media following his departure from the show. Naga, 46, has since taken the opportunity to quietly react to her colleague and pal's exit after her BBC co-star Ben Thompson shared a cheeky photo. The broadcaster penned a heartfelt message to Dan as he joked about their height. Ben shared a series of photos from the BBC Breakfast studios but it was one photo in particular that caught Naga's attention.
