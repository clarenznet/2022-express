Manchester City are one point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the table and will secure their fourth title in five years if they beat Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium this afternoon. But if the Citizens slip-up, the Reds will be crowned champions if they get the better of Wolves at Anfield.  Meanwhile, north London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal will be battling to secure fourth spot. Antonio Conte’s men leapfrogged the Gunners last weekend as they beat Burnley, before Arsenal lost to Newcastle on Monday night. And Spurs go into the final day of the season two points ahead of Mikel Arteta’s team as they head to Norwich, while Arsenal host Everton. There is still plenty to play for at the opposite end of the table as well as Burnley and Leeds will be doing all they can to avoid relegation to the Championship.
