A customer told Express.co.uk that they have not been able to access their current account when attempting to login into online banking earlier today. The customer said they tried to log on to their Halifax current account and it’s "not working". They added: "Can’t pay anyone.”  Despite this complaint, Downtector is not reporting a drastic uptake in the amount of problems reported by customers as of right now. On its website, the online platform states: “User reports indicate no current problems at Halifax.” Those who are impacted by issues with online banking systems or services are able to report them via Downdetector.

At the time, a Lloyds spokesperson said: "We know some of our customers had issues accessing mobile and online banking for a short time this morning. “We're sorry about this and both our website and app are now back to normal. "The issue lasted for around 20 minutes and was resolved before 11am."
