Spain's Eurovision entry Chanel Terrero Martinez, 30, belted out her song SloMo at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 this evening. But it wasn’t just her impressive vocals that stole the show. The singer flaunted her pert rear in a bottom-baring outfit, while showing off her flexibility with some impressive dance moves. Chanel wore a very skimpy bodysuit, which left her derriere on full display. Cuban singer Chanel worked with a choreographer to the stars, Kyle Hanagami, on her jaw-dropping Eurovision performance. Kyle has an impressive pop music CV, having worked with Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, and Justin Bieber. Passionate performer Chanel brought her amazing experience to the stage tonight, after she enrolled in dance, gymnastics, singing and acting since the age of six.
