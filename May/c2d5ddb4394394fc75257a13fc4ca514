Martin Seeley, CEO and sleep expert at mattressnextday.co.uk, shared his top tips with Birmingham Live. "When booking your room, consider requesting a room that’s on a higher level as that way you’re less likely to be disturbed by street-level noise, or noises coming from the hotel’s lobby or bar," explains Martin. "You should also make sure to request a room that’s away from the lift, as this is also prone to making noise that can keep you awake." But it's not just location that's important when securing the best room possible. Martin added: "Being too hot or too cold can disrupt your sleep so try and pick a room that has an air conditioning system, so you are in control of the temperature. At least two hours before bed, set it to 15.6 to 19.4 degrees Celsius as this creates the perfect sleep environment." He spoke out as holiday bookings continue to soar amid the relaxation of Covid restrictions worldwide. On The Beach reported sales have been "resilient" so far over the past eight weeks, increasing 33% against pre-pandemic levels. It added that it is optimistic about the recent relaxation of travel restrictions from the UK to Spain and its islands, which it said "should support a stronger late market". When considering which hotels to book, the website also advises: "Booking a 3-star hotel means you avoid the higher price tag associated with 4 and 5-star hotels but it doesn’t have to mean compromise. There are plenty of 3-star hotels out there that are packed with facilities, offer comfy rooms AND have entertainment activities for the whole gang, you’ve just gotta search for them!"
