Royal biographer Angela Levin made the comments following reports the Sussexes have allowed cameras into their Montecito home for a new show which the streaming giant wants later this year to coincide with the Duke's tell-all book. It comes amid speculation Harry could make further bombshell claims about the royals in his memoirs following his and Meghan's Oprah Winfrey interview.  Ms Levin believes the series could be another blow to the Royal Family. She told The Sun: "I think the Royal Family will be horrified because if Harry's memoirs are coming out at a similar time - which seems what Netflix want - then itâ€™s a double attack on the Royal Family. "I don't know how they can manage this without taking strong action but I don't think the Queen wants that." Ms Levin's comments come after Page Six reported that the couple are making an "at home with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex-style" docuseries as part of their Netflix deal, with a Hollywood insider claiming the streaming giant was "getting its pound of flesh". Express.co.uk has contacted Archewell and Netflix for comment. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
