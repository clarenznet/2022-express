Ferdinand said on Vibe with Five: "His comments he said about 'good isn't good enough', that's the type of language that I like to hear." "He's got to get that on the training pitch. He wants to be a dominating and dictating team. That's what he had at Ajax. "It's a very different make up he's coming into right now, so he's got a lot to do, a lot of work to do." Ten Hag gave an honest reflection of the club's current situation, saying: "We want to make the fans proud," he said. "Second, of course we are in this moment, the current situation is obviously not that good. "It's a big challenge. I want to build and construct a team who are battling for each other, who are unified and who will get results. "Also we are playing in the Theatre of Dreams. We want to entertain - but in the end, the intention is to play fantastic football. If we can't play fantastic football, we still have to win."
