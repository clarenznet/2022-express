A week after giving away free copies of Borderlands 3, Epic Games is back with another incredible offer for gaming fans. Available to download and keep, Epic Store customers can grab a free copy of the excellent BioShock: The Collection on PC. This unbelievable deal is live now until 3.59pm BST on June 2, so download it this weekend to avoid missing out. BioShock: The Collection features the entire BioShock trilogy of games, as well as all post-release DLC and add-ons. This includes the mind-bending action of BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea, which is a two-part campaign set in the dying days of Rapture. That's on top of the critically-acclaimed BioShock 2 DLC Minerva's Den, as well as a virtual museum and director's commentary for the original game. In addition to all of the core games and DLC, the BioShock Collection features improved visuals for all three titles. "Experience the unforgettable worlds and monumental stories of the award-winning BioShock series with BioShock: The Collection," reads the official description. "Journey to the cities of Rapture and Columbia across BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition, including all single-player add-on content. Fight for your life and outsmart your enemies, be it deep beneath the waves or high above the clouds." If you want to take advantage of the free game giveaway, simply head over to the Epic Games Store and either login or create an account. Once you're set up, you can visit the BioShock Collection store page and redeem the bundle for free. BioShock: The Collection will be replaced by a mystery game at 4pm BST on June 2, so check back next week for more information. Based on the current standard of free games, it's likely to be another blockbuster. It's also worth remembering that the free game giveaway coincides with the Mega Sale, which includes an additional 25% discount for customers.
