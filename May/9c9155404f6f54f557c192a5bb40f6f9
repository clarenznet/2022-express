Lara's first tip was to keep sandwiches in the freezer. She unveiled that sandwiches containing ingredients ahead of their use by date can be kept fresh in the freezer for up to 30 days. This means they can be defrosted and eaten any time, with the ingredients still fresh and intact.  The mum-of-two's second tip was in regard to vegetables. To save money annually, families could try to grow their own vegetables in the garden - spring onions and herbs are among the easiest to plant yourself. As for fruit, some of these can also be kept in the freezer to make them last longer. Lemons, for example, can go off quickly, but chopping them and placing them in the freezer prevents this. With fresh fruit and leafy greens, there is a simple method to make them last longer. After rinsing fruit such as raspberries or strawberries clean, Lara recommended drying them thoroughly and then adding a paper kitchen towel to them to absorb any excess moisture. Soaking up the moisture makes the fruit last longer, preventing the from going stale and fluffy. Furthermore, to keep garlic cloves fresher for longer, Lara recommended storing them in a dark and cool place. Other shoppers were quick to comment on the mum-of-two's video, praising her for the hacks, and even offering some tips themselves.
