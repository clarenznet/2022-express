A group of Manchester United supporters will walk out of Old Trafford during Monday's clash against Brentford, as another protest against the Glazer family is held. The owners have been targeted in their last two home games, and another protest is planned for their final fixture at Old Trafford this season. Manchester United supporters are planning yet another protest against the Glazer family, with a mass walkout expected against Brentford. Fans have been urged to join protests and walk out of Old Trafford on the 73rd minute of Monday's clash against Brentford, missing the final 17 minutes. The number is significant as the Glazers have now owned United for 17 years, and a large group of supporters remain against their involvement at the club. This isn't the first protest that has been staged against the owners, and it certainly won't be the last. But as Brentford is United's final home game of the season, it's their last chance to make their voices heard before the start of the next campaign.  JUST IN: Man Utd target De Jong lifts lid on Xavi talks as Ten Hag plots move The latest protest has been organised by the group 'The 1958', who are intent on upholding the values of United through culture and traditions. They have staged protests during United's last two home games, and they have gathered momentum, attracting more supporters to join each time. The Glazers have never been the most popular owners amongst the Untied fans, but their patience wore thin during the European Super League talks. Fans disrupted one of their biggest home games of the season against Liverpool, and the plans to breakaway into a new league were quickly retracted. But the fans haven't forgotten, and even with the impending arrival of Erik ten Hag this summer, members of the group have told Joe.co.uk that this will not deter their plans to protest. The 1958 aren't the only group against the Glazers though, as there are multiple protest groups all pushing for the same end result.  DON'T MISS  The latest protest is being staged by The 1958, but a spokesperson for the group spoke about how their intensions all align in the end. "There's a lot of different groups from within the United fanbase who've had their own ideas of how to do this," a spokesperson told Joe.co.uk. "MUST (Manchester United Supporters Trust), TRA (The Red Army), all the rest of the match-going fans, too. We respect that people have different ways of wanting to fix this, but we just felt like we need to be on the same page if what we do is to be effective. "We all want the Glazers gone, so it's about setting aside any slight differences and coming together as one. That's what we're trying to create.  "At the Norwich game the other week, we felt for the first time in a long time there were no factions. We didn’t want it to be about all those other groups, we just wanted us to be united. That’s what it needs to be if we're going to get anywhere." And it's expected that their protests against Brentford will gain a large amount of interest too, as the countless empty seats against Chelsea on Thursday proved that fans are willing to sacrifice matches in order to make a stand. And the anti-Glazer movement has even been backed by club legend Gary Neville. Neville has called out the owners for not engaging with the fans despite promising to do so the last time that United fans protested their ownership. Neville said on Sky Sports in March: “We heard Joel Glazer say some time ago he was going to engage with the fans.  "Flights are open Joel, you can get to Manchester. Let’s see you over here, let’s see you talk to the fans properly. Explain that vision, you’ve got a new CEO in place, but you can’t just leave it to the new CEO. "You’ve got to come over, he said off the back of the Super League he was going to change the way he operated the club, and he was going to come over and see the fans. He’s not done. "Not that I know of anyway, unless he’s slipped in without me knowing, and not many people slip into Manchester without me knowing! They've sent Tom Brady over, but it’d be nice if they sent themselves over."
