Sue Gray published her long-awaited report into lockdown rule-breaking parties in Downing Street on Wednesday morning. The report included detailed information about 18 different gatherings within No 10. It has also heaped even more pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has so far refused to resign. Ms Gray wrote: "The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. "Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen.
