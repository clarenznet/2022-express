Meghan and Harry will not appear alongside the Queen on the iconic Buckingham Palace balcony on June 2  following the Trooping of the Colour as Her Majesty will only be accompanied by working royals. However, there are reports a second balcony appearance will take place on Sunday, June 5 after the Platinum Jubilee Pageant to show the “future of the monarchy”. If this goes ahead, the Queen is expected to be joined by heirs Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George, but more members could join them. Meghan and Harry stepped down as working royals two years ago but can continue to attend some celebrations in a family capacity, including the thanksgiving service on Friday, June 3. Royal biographer Omid Scobie said the couple may be invited onto the balcony later in the weekend. He said: "We'll definitely see Harry and Megan at the Thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral." He also confirmed Meghan and Harry "will not be out" on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast on Thursday but said they could make a "surprise appearance" on Sunday. Meghan and Harry will bring their two children, three-year-old Archie and Lilibet, who is days away from her first birthday, to the UK for the celebrations. The family are expected to stay at Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate, where they lived before they relocated to the US. This will be Lilibet's first visit to the UK and she is yet to meet the Queen or her royal relatives. Following the announcement of their decision to travel, a spokesperson for the couple said: "Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are excited and honoured to attend the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children."
