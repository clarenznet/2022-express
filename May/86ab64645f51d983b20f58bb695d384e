The London club beat Leeds United 2-1 at Old Trafford in the 1970 FA Cup final replay in a game notorious for its physicality. Under modern standards there would have been at least six red cards and 20 yellows, but referee Eric Jennings decided to book just one player. Alan, who made 145 appearances for Chelsea between 1969 and 1974, played in every round of the 1969/70 FA Cup but missed the final due to injury. The midfielder gave his medal to his mother, who wore it as part of a necklace until her death and it then passed to his uncle who has also now passed away. Alan, 70, said: "My father made me the player that I was, but I gave it to my mum because, as they say, behind every man there is a great woman. "She always looked after me and cleaned my kit and boots." Peter Preston-Morley, head of the coin department at Noonans, of London, which is auctioning the nine-carat gold piece, said: "The FA Cup final replay, at Old Trafford in April 1970 is still considered the most brutal game in the history of English football." The sale takes place on June 15.
