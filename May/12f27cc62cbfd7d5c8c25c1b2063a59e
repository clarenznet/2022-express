Lady Victoria Hervey risked a wardrobe function in her latest outfit at the Cannes Film Festival as she took to the red carpet today. The model, 45, looked phenomenal in a dazzling black gown which flashed various parts of the her incredible physique.  The model stepped out in the intricate design to attend the screening of the film, Triangle of Sadness. The jaw-dropping gown was in stark contrast to the soft pink dress the model had worn just days before. The edgy design of the black number featured lines of darkly coloured sequins which only just covered Lady Victoria's modesty as she posed on the red carpet. Lady Victoria was forced to go braless because of the nature of the stunning number which also featured dramatic effects on the shoulders. However, a strip of her nude underwear could clearly be seen through the sheer black panelling of the garment. The dramatic effect of the gown was heightened thanks to the long train that dragged behind her as she walked. Lady Victoria opted to keep her blonde hair pulled away from her face in a simple updo with curls pinned at the back of her head. Not wanting to detract from the statement effect of the dress, the model opted for a simple pair of silver earrings and black satin heels.
