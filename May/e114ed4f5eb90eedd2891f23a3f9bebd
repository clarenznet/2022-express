Brooklyn Beckham, 23 and Nicola Peltz, 27, were spotted enjoying a night out in Miami after watching the first Formula 1 to be held in the city. On his Instagram Stories, it showed the budding chef also hanging out with his brother-in-law, Bradley Peltz. It was the same event attended by his dad, David Beckham, and younger brother, 19-year-old Romeo – however, there were no photos of the Beckham boys all together. David did share some photos with fans and could be seen beaming next to Romeo and his girlfriend, Mia Regan, but Brooklyn did not feature. It comes just one month after the family all came together to celebrate Brooklyn and Nicola's marriage, which took place in April at her family home in Palm Beach. The newlyweds looked casual and comfortable as they stepped out to Carbone Beach after a day of racing. Nicola looked chic as she wore a 90’s style black camisole that featured a floral print, paired with oversized jeans and chunky black heeled boots. Meanwhile, Brooklyn kept things simple in a plain white t-shirt teamed with a beige shirt, jeans and white trainers.
