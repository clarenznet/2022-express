Queen Elizabeth II's highly anticipated Platinum Jubilee kicks off in two days on June 2 and lasts until June 5. The monarch's 70th year on the throne has resulted in a four-day weekend that promises scattered events to promote national unity. One of these events will celebrate the occasion in an Olympic fashion, with beacons soon igniting across the country. Platinum Jubilee organisers have designed three types of beacon events this year that will ask the Queen's subjects to light torches across the UK and beyond. More than 2,800 lit beacons will bring people together from June 2. They will commemorate "the Queen’s long and selfless service", with three distinct types lit between June 2 and 5.

The first few beacons will ignite in British territories from June 2, creating a burning network stretching tens of thousands of miles. British Overseas Territories, starting with Tonga and Samoa, will host the first beacons, with Belize finishing the ceremony in South America. Communities across the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will follow in unison on the same day. As British administered regions and nations light their torches, so will Commonwealth nations. While fewer countries share the Queen as their head of state compared to 2012, there are still a total of 54. The capital city of each will light a tributary beacon of their own, following thousands of others. The Commonwealth capitals include: Europe Africa Asia Caribbean and Americas Pacific The beacon celebrations culminate in the "principal" beacon held at Buckingham Palace. The 21-metre tall “tree of trees” sculpture designed by Thomas Heatherwick and consisting of 350 potted native British trees will ignite on the evening of June 2. The final beacon commemorates the more than a million Jubilee trees planted as part of the Queen's Green Canopy (QGC). Each beacon - regardless of the type - will ignite at 9.15pm local time.
