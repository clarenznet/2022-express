Hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip were broadcasting a special episode of This Morning from the palace. They were joined by chef Phil Vickery who delivered them a plate of scones to discuss the never-ending controversy. That's when Phillip, who grew up in Newquay, revealed he was denied one scone with jam first by Buckingham Palace staff. Arguing that the cream tea debate "has gone even bigger", he said: "Because I grew up in Cornwall, I'm very much the other way round. So this morning - and I'm hoping I'm not going to get anyone into trouble, I did say, 'Is there any way I can just have one the other way round with the jam first and the cream on top?'. And I was told - very politely - that is not the Buckingham Palace way." According to Cornwall Live, Mr Vickery replied: "When you come here, you see, you eat exactly what Her Majesty eats." Yet, Darren McGrady, who used to be her chef for 15 years, previously said Elizabeth II puts jam first on her scones. In a tweet which he posted in 2018, he wrote: “Jam first or clotted cream first? Jam first at Buckingham Palace garden parties!” The debate has always caused controversy between Devon and Cornwall residents, with people even petitioning for it to be illegal for people to put the jam and cream on in the "wrong" order, depending on where you are in the country. One thing we know for sure though is that no matter how you serve it, cream tea is a big part of British culture. It has been served in the UK since the 11th century and arguments surrounding the toppings have continued ever since - even within the Royal residence, it seems.
