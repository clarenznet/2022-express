Darts World No 5 players James Wade was taken to hospital on Sunday in Leverkusen after withdrawing from his semi-final clash with Dimitri van den Bergh. The Englishman was suffering from a racing heart, nausea, dizziness and high blood pressure when he was assessed by paramedics.  The 39-year-old was then placed under care in a Leverkusen hospital but his condition has since been improving. Wade remains under observation and is understood to be 'comfortable.' In a statement posted on Wade's Twitter account, his wife Samantha provided some clarity on horrifying ordeal. "It was very worrying Sunday into Monday night and it is horrible to think of James there by himself when he has been so poorly," she said.  "Clearly we want him home as quickly as possible but the medical staff have been amazing with James and he is hugely grateful for the compassion and care they have shown him. "We are taking their advice on when it will be safe for him to return home." Aldershot-based Wade, who has 11 major titles to his name, is already plotting his return to action. "James is desperate to make sure he doesn't let anyone down and is already talking about returning to competitive action for people who have bought tickets," added his wife.  "Whilst that is in his nature, I am sure everyone will agree that him making a full recovery is the most important thing and we will be taking it day by day." The 39-year-old has also reached the semi-final of the World Championships on four occasions. Belgian van den Bergh proceeded to the final, where he was beaten by Michael van Gerwen. Wade is now looking certain to miss this week's Premier League Darts and the continuation of the European Tour this weekend.
