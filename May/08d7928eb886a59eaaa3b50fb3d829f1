The retailer reports its range of Jubilee themed tableware (Queen’s Jubilee Eco Paper Plates) is flying off the shelves with some of the lines already sold out. Sales of the Union Jack Cupcake Cases are up 115 per cent in the last fortnight and it has sold more of the Classic British Biscuit Cutter Set in May than it did in the whole of January as cooks prepare to make classic British biscuits. The most popular search terms on Lakeland’s website are of course ‘Jubilee’ and ‘Garden Party’. As baking fever sweeps across the UK, sales of its Right Royal Spectacle 2 Tier Cake Stand rose 170 per cent last week, the Traybake Tin is up 47 per cent with the Mini Sandwich Tin not far behind. The retailer reckons the official Platinum Jubilee baking competition seems to have inspired customers to have a go at making the winning trifle – four times as many of its Large Glass Footed Trifle Bowl so far in May have been sold, far out doing April’s sales. Now it’s the turn of the Mini Glass Footed Trifle Bowls which have soared 70 per cent in the last week. The extra time possible with the four-day weekend has been the driver behind the street parties and Big Jubilee lunch and it’s expected that 12 million people and 200,000 lunch gatherings will take place. For Jubilee home decorators Lakeland has launched a range of bunting Union Jack Bunting  and a dedicated page, the Jubilee celebrations blog packed full of ideas and recipes, is up and running inspiring customers to have go with suggestions from how to make a royal-themed afternoon tea to fun games to play at street parties.
