One industry leader accused UK politicians who have acquiesced to the Northern Ireland Protocol of “stark hypocrisy” - and warned the situation could get worse. The situation is outlined in a report published by the Campaign for an Independent Britain (CIBUK), featuring research by the Facts4EU think tank. They would have the option of landing catches at a British mainland port in Scotland such as Campbeltown, Troon or Fleetwood - but for any catch landed at a British mainland port to go to Northern Ireland would require the completion of customs forms countersigned by a vet as an independent witness. Nobody in London, Dublin or Brussels wanted to discuss the fact that things could get worse, Mr McCulla stressed. Referring to the point about Northern Irish ships being treated as “foreigners in their own land”, he said: “We continually highlight this to officials and politicians alike who do not dispute what is a fact." “What puzzles us can be their answer; ‘now isn’t the time to raise these issues in the negotiations." A Defra spokespman said: "We’ve been clear that we need to fix the Protocol, which is causing major problems on the ground. As we’ve repeatedly said if there’s no movement from the EU we will have no choice but to take action and the Government will set out more detail shortly. “Fishing vessels registered to ports in Northern Ireland are currently only required to meet pre-existing obligations when landing their catch into ports in Northern Ireland, such as those outlined in the fisheries control regulation. “Support and guidance to businesses on their current obligations under the Northern Ireland Protocol is available on GOV.UK.”
