Martin Lewis, 50, took to Twitter this morning to issue an apology to Ofgem staff after he “lost his rag” and raged that proposed changes are a “f***ing disgrace”. The money expert admitted that he “should have behaved better” and the incident was “inappropriate”.    “I pray when I do further analysis I have to apologise again as I've got it very wrong (if not I worry about dire consequences for consumers - we must do more to make things better for them).” Earlier today, Martin tweeted that Ofgem had "moved to a formal consultation about changing the price cap every three months (rather than current six)". The presenter added: "I had pushed to soften this to every four months but what counts is its structure (inc forward guidance). I'm due to discuss its proposals with it within the hour to learn more."
