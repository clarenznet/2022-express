Shockingly, 3.4 million pensioners are estimated to be missing out on this help from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). People who qualify for the full amount would be £369 per month better off which adds up to over £4,428 a year. More than two million pensioners are living in poverty due to the cost of living crisis, but many could be due extra financial support from the DWP. People who have reached state pension age are the most likely group to be missing out on Government help according to Age UK. One of the most underclaimed benefits is Attendance Allowance - more than three million people are entitled to this help but not claiming. This DWP benefit is available to pensioners who have an illness or disability that affects their everyday lives. READ MORE: Free prescriptions could save Britons hundreds but who qualifies?

It’s paid every week at two different rates, depending on the level of help someone requires. People should receive £61.85 if they need help during the day or at night. If someone needs help during both the day and night they could receive £92.40. Care home residents won’t usually be entitled to Attendance Allowance because their care is paid for by their local authority. However, it’s important to differentiate that they’ll still be able to claim Attendance Allowance if they pay for all their own care home costs. Eligibility assessments aren’t usually required and people will only need to attend an assessment if it’s unclear how their illness or disability affects them. Applicants might also qualify for Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or a Council Tax Reduction when they receive Attendance Allowance. What is happening where you live?
