Dame Joan Collins marked her 89th birthday in style as she joined a star-studded lineup at the Chelsea Flower Show yesterday. The Dynasty actress was joined by her husband Percy Gibson, 57, as the couple posed for pictures. Joan oozed elegance as she sported a mid-length floral dress which she teamed with a white blazer. The iconic actress elongated her legs in a pair of platform heels and accessorised her gorgeous attire with a wide-brimmed sun hat. The Dynasty star added a pair of white gloves as she held a chic leather bag. The legendary star sported bold makeup wearing bright pink lipstick and added a light blush to accentuate her features. The actress' husband Percy looked dapper in a suit wearing a crisp shirt teamed with a red tie and a dark blazer with grey trousers. He came prepared for any unpredictable weather changes as he clutched a pink umbrella. The couple posed together in the heartwarming photos as Joan celebrated her birthday. The actress was in good company as the Queen visited the Chelsea Flower Show in London - using a buggy for the first time at the event, as she toured the gardens and exhibits. The 96-year-old monarch, who has mobility problems, was driven around the annual flower show.
