She was branded a “monster” by the tot’s grieving birth mother. Preston Crown Court heard that, in one text to her husband Scott, 35, she admitted: “I’ve just leathered him again. I’m just an abusive parent.” On January 6, 2021, Castle dialled 999 claiming Leiland-James had fallen off the sofa. But he suffered a brain bleed and died in hospital. Yesterday, she was jailed for life and told she will serve a minimum term of 18 years for the child’s murder and for child cruelty. Judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said she had a “selfish desire” to keep the baby despite struggling to bond with him. In a letter to the judge, the baby’s birth mother Laura Corkill said: “When he was seven months old, he was placed in the home of a monster. A monster who was meant to love and cherish him.” Miss Corkill also slammed adoption authorities, adding: “Leiland-James was taken from me because of the risk of ­emotional and physical harm, but he has suffered these at the hands of his adoptive parent.” “It has made me feel a lot of hurt and anger against the local authority and I do not trust them. I was told he would be safe and have a good life.” The trial heard Leiland-James died from “catastrophic” head and neck injuries sustained at the home that Castle shared with her husband. Castle, of Barrow, Cumbria, denied murder and only admitted manslaughter on the opening day of her trial, but admitted she had “shaken the life” out of Leiland-James. Scott Castle was cleared of allowing the death of a child and child cruelty.
