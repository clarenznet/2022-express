Sir David Attenborough looked younger than his 96 years as the veteran broadcaster attended the premiere of his groundbreaking AppleTV+ series Prehistoric Planet at the BFI IMAX in Waterloo on Wednesday. The naturalist attended the launch of the five-part series, which uses CGI to recreate the dinosaurs that inhabited Earth millions of years ago. The broadcaster looked to be in high spirits as he cut a casual look at the event. Sir David sported a crisp white shirt which he teamed with a blue blazer, dark trousers and comfortable shoes. The presenter arrived for the series' launch, ahead of its release on AppleTV+ on May 23. The show will be released in five parts, each depicting different settings where dinosaurs lived during the Late Cretaceous period, with Sir David narrating the programme. His appearance comes just days after the on-screen broadcaster was awarded the Champions of the Earth Lifetime Achievement Award by the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP). Upon receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award, Sir David urged action to prevent further destruction of the planet.
