Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa quit after the clashes in Colombo. Five people have died, including ruling party MP Amarakeerthi Athukorala. More than 190 were hurt. Police had to use tear gas and water cannons on pro-government supporters who stormed a protest camp outside government offices. The brother of the Prime Minister, Gotabaya Rajapaksa – Sri Lanka’s president – is now also under pressure to quit amid its worst economic crisis in decades. Rising prices, shortages and power cuts sparked the violent protests. The president declared a state of emergency last week.
