The supermarket chain has revealed that on each Tuesday from May 24, customers over 60 will get a 10 percent discount on their groceries with no minimum spend. Shoppers will need to show proof of age, such as a driving licence, or a travel card. The discount will be available in-store at Iceland and The Food Warehouse branches. Iceland said its actions are motivated by research from Age UK, which showed three quarters of older people worry about the rising cost of living. The firm is also looking at a national rollout of its £30 vouchers to those receiving state pension, following a regional trial over Christmas. Richard Walker, managing director at Iceland, said: “We hope it will help all those in this age category cut costs.”
