Elon Musk's mum Maye Musk was a vision in cream last night as she attended the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Party at the Hard Rock Hotel in Times Square, New York. The model, 74, oozed glamour and sophistication as she attended the red carpet event without her Tesla-founder son, Elon.  The Canadian-South African American model dazzled in a cream suit jacket which she paired with a white tulle skirt. The tailored jacket perfectly fit her slight frame and the floaty design of the skirt elongated her long legs. Maye posed expertly on the red carpet for snaps at the glitzy event. She finished her look with a pair of sparkling heels, a pair of matching earrings and a white, quilted Christian Dior handbag.  Her silver hair was style into a loose, slicked back fashion with plenty of volume. Despite her billionaire son Elon being absent from the glitzy event, Maye had no shortage of celebrity friends to pose with on the red carpet. The model was snapped cosying up to popstar Ciara, as well as publisher and entrepreneur, Jason Binn.
