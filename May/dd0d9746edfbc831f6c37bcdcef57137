Ageless beauty Raquel Welch, now 81, starred as Loana in the 1966 film, which was set at the dawn of humankind. She wore a stunning cave woman themed bikini costume for the occasion, boasting a look that had many viewers glued to the screen. Viewers were left open-mouthed by the fur and hide costume she wore, described at the time as "wearing mankind's first bikini". Her bottoms were made from just a piece of fabric, tied tantalisingly at the upper thigh to reveal Raquel's toned legs. Meanwhile, her matching bikini top boasted cross over straps below the bust to accentuate her modestly sized midriff. Three types of costume were created for use in the film - and all proved spectacular in the eyes of viewers. The timeless beauty showcased her incredible physique in the stunning photos. Her light tresses hung loosely over her face as she opted for minimal makeup.
