Leann McConnell left her tabby cat, who she called “Fat S***”, with another feline and a dog in a home for weeks without enough food or water. A court heard the other cat, named Tilly, and the terrier called Chunk both ate parts of the "Fat S***'s" body, due to hunger, after the cat had died. RSPCA inspectors found the cat’s body, partially eaten, at the property in Norris Green, Liverpool, in November last year, reports Liverpool Echo. Peter Mitchell, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said photos taken of all the animals were "gruesome". These were not shown yesterday in Liverpool Magistrates' Court, where McConnell admitted three counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. These are animal neglect charges. Mr Mitchell said: "The cat ('Fat S***') died during that particular time and has been eaten because there was no other food to eat for the other animals." McConnell, now of no fixed abode, will be sentenced in June at the Complex Case Court at Sefton Magistrates’ Court Her lawyer, Toni Moran, said the woman had significant mental health issues and asked for a pre sentence report to be ordered. She said inspectors did reference there being some dry food in the home McConnell was living in at the time of the offences, but said that might prove to be of minimal importance to the case.
