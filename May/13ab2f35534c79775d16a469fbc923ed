Kylie Minogue flashed her flesh through the sheer portions of her floor-length black dress as she attended this year's 2022 Cannes Film Festival. The music icon, 53, made a dazzling appearance to celebrate the screening of new biopic, Elvis, honouring the life and career of rockabilly music star Elvis Presley. Kylie wowed the crowds in her gown, with the top half almost totally sheer apart from the bra section. She accessorised with an emerald-encrusted diamond necklace and black strappy sandals. The star, who is the highest selling Australian female recording artist of all time, was all smiles as she took to the red carpet to pose for the cameras. Meanwhile, Kylie - who has made more than one appearance in Cannes this past week - is celebrating her latest Can't Get You Out Of My Head remix with Peggy Gou, and no doubt hoping it will be another chart-topper. The movie Elvis has been endorsed by Elvis' daughter Lisa Marie and has already received glowing reviews.
