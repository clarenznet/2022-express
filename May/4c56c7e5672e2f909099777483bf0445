The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said in a speech yesterday at the National Army Museum that Russia's General Valery Gerasimov has sent soldiers to war with inadequate equipment. He said soldiers have resorted to the “tragic” use of pine logs as makeshift protection and vehicles were “frequently found with 1980s paper maps of Ukraine in them." Vladimir Solovyov, one of Putin's most-prominent propagandists, has been complaining about the "shameful" length of time it takes for weapons to reach the frontlines in Ukraine While guests on Russian state TV have also been complaining that men are being sent into battle "with weapons of yesteryear." Mr Wallace said cages had been welded to the tops of Russian tank turrets, intended as an extra defence against rocket attacks from above, but all they have done is made vehicles easier to spot. Mr Wallace also warned that Putin would “be around for some time” and the West must find a way to “contain him and his Russia”. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
