Sophie Liard, also known as The Folding Lady, has over four million followers on TikTok. She keeps her fans mesmerised with nifty tips and tricks for folding, sorting and organising. She spoke to Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond about the folding tips that will change your life. Dermot O'Leary praised The Folding Lady's "simple" hacks, stating that would "revolutionise how you organise your wardrobe and drawers forever". The Folding Lady started off by showing viewers at home how to quickly and effortlessly fold a hoody. She said: "We're going to start with the simple hoodies because I was thinking we might want to be putting some of these away to make some space in our wardrobe." Now is a perfect time to perfect our hoodie folding technique, with warmer weather on the horizon.

"To do that you're just going to put your fingers in the sides and then pull." Next, Sophie told viewers to fold in the sleeves. She demonstrated this by folding them into the centre and then down. "That's how we used to do it in the store, all day, every day." Then, she folded the hoodie from the bottom upwards, three times. Dermot O'Leary commented on her choice to fold three times. "Now that's interesting, when you fold over you do three. "Sometimes I do one and it's too big, sometimes I do two and it feels too small." But The Folding Lady revealed that it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. "It depends on the size of the clothing. "If it's a longer item you might want to do four, if it's shorter you might want to do two - all depends on the size."
