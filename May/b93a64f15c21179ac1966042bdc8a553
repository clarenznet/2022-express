The five times gold medal winner, 27, told of her anger when she came across the new treatment, saying that society should value diversity. Speaking on today's Desert Island Discs, she also told how she struggled to rebuild her confidence after "feeling pressurised" by an unnamed coach at the Rio 2016 Games. Ellie, who has achondroplasia, the most common condition that causes dwarfism, explored the controversial treatment in a BBC One documentary, a World Without Dwarfism. She said: "I got really, really angry when I first saw [the drug].Why would we need a drug that's going to change us? I thought we were at a time in our lives when we were accepting people who are different - either religion, race, colour, disability - but still there's so much more we can do. "But this drug is always going to be there, isn't it? It's never going to go away now. "We've just got to help people who are making that change to maybe not go down that path, to realise yeah, it's amazing that your child has dwarfism or it is different, they can live the most amazing happy life, they can live a healthy life, they don't need an injection every single day to be happy, they can be OK without it." Ellie, who grew up in Aldridge,West Midlands, shot to fame aged just 13 when she won two golds for Team GB at the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing. She then won 26 golds at the Paralympics and World and European Championships, before announcing her retirement last year.   But she said of her training for Rio 2016: "I remember I got IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] really badly because I was so stressed and I remember crying over the phone.There was a coach there who was not a nice guy at all, he put the pressure on us. "And he knocked my confidence hugely and I'm finally trying to get over it. "Now I've left the sport you realise that he had a bit of a grip on me." Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, 11am today.
