With the cost of living increasing at an ever-alarming rate we're all looking for ways to slash those monthly bills and a new deal from BT can do exactly that. The UK Internet Service Provider (ISP) has just launched a big Spring Sale event which is offering customers the chance to get broadband beamed into their homes at a cheaper price. Right now you can sign up for BT's basic 36Mbps Fibre Essential plan and pay just £26.99 per month - that's a £2 saving off the standard £28.99 price. If that sounds too slow then there's also Fibre 1 with 50Mbps speeds for £27.99 per month (saving £2) or Fibre 2 with 75Mbps downloads for £31.99 (also saving £2). All of these offers last for 24 months and right now it's also free to join which means you don't have to pay the usual £9.99 postage fee. Other extras featured in the plan include BT's Stay Fast Guarantee which means speeds should never drop below a certain level and there are also unlimited downloads so you can watch and stream as much content as you like without fear of any extra charges.
