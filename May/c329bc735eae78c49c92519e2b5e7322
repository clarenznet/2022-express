Experts also found both sexes under the age of 45 were more likely to pile on pounds than other ages. But research found the vast majority stayed around the same weight, according to their body mass index (BMI).This was at a time when awareness was growing of how obesity was an underlying risk for Covid complications. Professor Thomas Yates, of Leicester University, said: "The implications of even modest weight gain in younger adults and women could translate into diabetes, heart disease, cancers and other serious obesity-related problems unless action is taken." In the overweight category, 13 percent of women against nine percent of men became obese. Similarly, compared with older age groups, those younger than 45 were more likely to gain weight.The data on almost a million UK adults will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Maastricht.
