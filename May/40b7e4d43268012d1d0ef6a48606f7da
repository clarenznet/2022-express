  Christine posted some holiday snaps, posing in the sunshine in front of some palm trees yesterday. She captioned the post: “Dress down v dress up! #wallis #christinelampardxwallis #foreverwallis #ad.” The first picture showed her modelling a teal and black patterned robe. The next showed the mum-of-two smiling as she held baby Freddie in her arms.  She also included a promotional snap of her outfit, which featured a pair of white trousers, a black strappy top and some black sandals. Christine and Frank share two children together, their baby son Freddie and three-year-old daughter Patricia. Frank has two daughters with his former fiancée, Spanish model Elen Rivas. Frank and Elen’s daughter Luna is 16 years old, while Isla is 15.
