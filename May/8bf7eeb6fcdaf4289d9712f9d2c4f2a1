Kim Kardashian and her comedian beau Pete Davidson turned heads as they arrived in London to enjoy a romantic date night. On Monday night, the A-list couple enjoyed a dinner at River Cafe on the Thames in the capital just in time for the Queen's Jubilee celebrations later this week. The duo were dressed down for the affair as they were spotted arriving at the venue. Kim kept her bleached-blonde locks from the glitzy Met Gala earlier in the year. She wore her tresses in a slicked-back bun which finished at the nape of her neck. The reality star wore a completely black outfit, including a pair of skintight leggings and v-neck jumper. As always, Kim donned a full face of makeup including a nude lip and perfectly lined eyes. Former SNL funnyman Pete looked even more casual in a red and blue checked shirt which he wore underneath an oversized black jacket. He kept his look casual witha pair of dark jeans and white trainers, while Kim opted for her signature heeled boots
