The results for the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 sent shockwaves with viewers as the hosts read out the public and jury votes. The UK's entry Sam Ryder came out on top with 283 points from the jury vote, followed closely by Sweden and Spain. However, because the UK was at the top of the leaderboard, it meant Sam had to wait until the end to see how he was scored by the public. However, things quickly changed because halfway through, Serbia topped the UK with 312 points. Poor Germany came in last place with just six points from the public vote. France also landed at the bottom of the leaderboard with a total of 17 points. Iceland also ranked third from last with just 20 points from the public and jury vote.
