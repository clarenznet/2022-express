Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has responded to reports suggesting Sadio Mane has agreed a move to Bayern Munich. The Reds face Real Madrid in the Champions League final tomorrow, and Klopp has hit out at the Bundesliga champions for attempting to distract his side. Reports emerged on Friday claiming Mane has agreed a deal with Bayern ahead of a potential move this summer. Mane has been tipped to leave ahead of the end of his contract, with just a year remaining on his current deal. The winger has cemented his place as one of the best attackers in the world this season and has played all across the front three after the arrival of Luis Diaz in January. But the fact his contract will be up next year has led to speculation he could depart this summer. And Bayern, who have been linked for a number of weeks, have reportedly agreed a three-year deal with Mane's representatives and are ready to pull the trigger on a €30million (£25.4m) bid. But those reports have come at the wrong time for Liverpool, who are less than a day away from the Champions League final against Real Madrid. Speaking at his press conference on Friday, Klopp didn't hold back when discussing the rumours, but insisted he wouldn't comment on their authenticity. He said: "Sadio is in the shape of his life. It's a joy to watch him at the moment. Football asks a lot of him this year. I couldn't care less about the Bayern rumours. "He knows how important it is. No concerns. It’s not the first time in my career Bayern have been talking about my players before a final" Klopp has an unfortunate history of losing players to Bayern Munich. Back in 2013, when he was at Borussia Dortmund, it was confirmed he had lost Mario Gotze to Bayern just a month before the two teams competed the 2013 Champions League final. Just six months later, Bayern swooped again and agreed a pre-contract agreement to sign Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer.
