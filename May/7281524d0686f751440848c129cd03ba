Professor Michael Clarke sat down with journalist Mark Austin to discuss Sweden and Finland joining NATO. Mr Clarke spoke about how the war in Ukraine had started over accusations that Ukraine was being manipulated by the Western alliance, threatening neighbouring Russia. The professor then talked about how NATO had been expanding since 1949, as the alliance was about to grow to 32 countries with membership since Sweden and Finland had submitted applications this week. Mr Clarke said Sweden and Finland's joining was a failure on Putin's part, and that the Russian dictator was probably furious about the news.    Professor Clarke told Sky News: "Well I think he's trying to save his dignity here. "Because... I mean this whole crisis he said it began because Ukraine was being manipulated by NATO. "And was constantly threatening Russia by and large expanding. "Remember to put myself in his position... NATO has enlarged itself since 1949, nine times, nine times it started off with 12 members it's now got 30, and it's about to get 32. "So it's getting towards three times' the size that it was when it began.   JUST IN: 'END of Russia' Putin told UK will 'cripple' Moscow in swift revenge for nuclear strike      Professor Clarke added: "And over those nine enlargements, six of them have taken place whilst President Putin's been in power. "So he's sat in the Kremlin and he's seen NATO's borders come a thousand miles nearer to Moscow, and he thinks in very territorial terms. "He's not a very subtle man, he's not a subtle thinker, that's what he sees. "And so I think he's furious about this idea that Finland and Sweden should join NATO, it's a massive political failure on his part, strategic failure. "Massive strategic failure and I think he's trying to rescue a bit of his dignity by saying it's no big deal." READ MORE:'I felt sick!'
