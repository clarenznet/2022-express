If you've ever wondered who would top the video game character rich list in real life, then you're in luck. A new study conducted by online gaming company Solitaired has explored which video game icons would earn the most money if their virtual profession was real, plus who would earn the least. Top of the rich list is Handsome Jack from Borderlands, with estimated earnings of £333,043 as a CEO. Special Forces soldier Solid Snake is next with earnings of over £100,000, followed by Virologist Albert Wesker from Resident Evil. The study uses data from salary comparison sites, as well as publicly available pay bands to find an average yearly salary for more than 50 video game characters. Call of Duty's Alex Mason, Max Payne and L.A. Noire detective Cole Phelps are other high earners, alongside Gordon Freeman from Half Life and Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell. Pac-Man - who's listed as a Japanese security guard - leads the way on the list of lowest earners, with an estimated average income of £15,916. Martial Arts instructor Ryu is also among the lowest earners, taking home an average of £21,713. You can see the full lists of highest and lowest earners below...
