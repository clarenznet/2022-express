Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen has landed fourth on a list of the highest-earning athletes under the age of 25 by Sportico. The sports business website ranked the Dutchman at No. 4 behind Paris Saint-Germain striker Kylian Mbappe, tennis star Naomi Osaka and NFL quarterback Josh Allen. Verstappen inked a bumper new five-year deal to stay with Red Bull through the 2028 season, although final numbers are disputed. The Guardian had previously reported the world champion was worth £40 million annually whereas Sportico pin it at just £31.4m. As a result of the Dutchman’s contract, he now sits alongside Lewis Hamilton as the best-paid driver in F1. The seven-time world champion recently dropped out of the acclaimed Forbes list of the top 10 highest-earning sportspeople in the world after coming in at eighth in 2021. Verstappen’s total income is estimated by Sportico at £19m less than Buffalo Bills star Allen in the list of the world’s top earning athletes under the age of 25, while he earned £5m less than Mbappe and £8m less than Osaka. Jake Paul, who switched YouTube for boxing, comes in at sixth on the list after earning £29.6m when accounting for salary and endorsements.
