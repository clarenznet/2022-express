Lawyers for the actor said a "mountain" of evidence that Depp, 57, assaulted his former wife was "simply not there" as they made their closing arguments in the US defamation lawsuit. He is suing Heard, 36, over a 2018 article she wrote in the Washington Post. The article does not mention him by name, but his lawyers say it falsely implies he physically and sexually abused her. His lawyer Camille Vasquez, below, began yesterday by reminding jurors that Heard had filed a restraining order against her former partner on May 27, 2016. "In doing so [she] ruined his life by falsely telling the world that she was a survivor of domestic abuse at the hands of Mr Depp," she said. "On May 27, 2022, exactly six years later, we ask you to give Mr Depp his life back." "What is at stake in this trial is a man's life." She added: "There is an abuser in this courtroom but it is not Mr Depp. There is a victim of domestic abuse in this courtroom, but it is not Ms Heard." Benjamin Rottenborn, for Heard, told jurors at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Virginia, to "think about the message that Depp and his attorneys were sending to Amber and victims of domestic abuse". He said: "If you didn't take pictures, it didn't happen. If you didn't seek medical attention, you weren't injured." He added: "Mr Depp cannot and will not take responsibility...it's all somebody else's fault." In his final remarks, Mr Rottenborn urged the jury to "stand up" for the US Constitution first amendment: "This trial is about so much more than Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. It's about freedom of speech." Depp is suing Heard for £38million while she is countersuing for £78million. The jury will now consider its ruling.
