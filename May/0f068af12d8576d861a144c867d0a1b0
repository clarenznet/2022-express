Cathedral bells rang out at 10.31pm last night to mark the moment Isis-inspired Salman Abedi, 22, set off his suicide bomb after an Ariana Grande concert. Mayor Andy Burnham was among those paying tribute, and remembrance services took place at the Glade of Light Memorial. He said the attack “could have divided us but it didn’t, it did the opposite – it brought us together” and was pictured at the Run with blast survivor Freya Lewis, 19. She had to learn to walk again after suffering several injuries but ran for the charity supporting the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital which saved her life. Freya needed a wheelchair for three months after losing best friend Nell Jones, then 14, in the explosion but has since helped raise more than £67,000. She said yesterday that Manchester “means the world to me. It’s the most incredible city. I’ll always remember the way it came together and took me in as a Mancunian, as one of their own”. Freya added that Nell “will be with me for the rest of my life”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to the victims, including the hundreds of people injured, saying Manchester’s courage in the aftermath of the carnage had “touched the world”, adding: “Hatred will never win.” While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wrote: “My thoughts are with [the victims’] loved ones and the people of Manchester.” Arena attack survivors have recently warned of major gaps in mental health help in a report calling for a guarantee of urgent and long-term access to support services.
