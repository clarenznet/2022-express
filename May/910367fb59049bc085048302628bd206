Drizzly skies could have dampened the spirits of the 8,000 guests at Buckingham Palace. But – just like the magical nanny made famous by film star Julie Andrews – Kate helped the medicine go down. Her dress was the same one she wore for the 50th anniversary of Prince Charles’ investiture in 2019.  Kate was joined in the Palace grounds by husband Prince William, who wore a dapper top hat and tails to the do, as did his uncle, Prince Edward. Edward’s wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, also dusted off an outfit, a blue one she has worn to Ascot. They were all standing in for the Queen, 96, who has bowed out of this year’s garden parties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will today praise Her Majesty as a “remarkable woman” and the nation’s “rock” for 70 years, when he addresses Parliament ahead of next week’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.
