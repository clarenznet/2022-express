Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag is weighing up the idea of launching a summer move for Inter Milan defender Alessandro Bastoni, according to reports. The Red Devils are widely expected to mount a large-scale recruitment drive over the coming weeks and months after limping to a sixth-placed finish in the Premier League table on the final day of the season. United are said to be targeting reinforcements in a number of problem positions ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window, with the addition of a new centre-back thought to be among the items on the agenda at Old Trafford. It seems as though Ten Hag could be poised to sanction a move for Bastoni in the not-too-distant future, with those in power at United 'studying' the right offer for the 23-year-old, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.It is claimed that United are the 'most credible' suitors for Bastoni's signature at this stage, although the likes of Tottenham and Manchester City are also believed to be keeping tabs on the defender's current situation. However, it remains to be seen whether Inter would be prepared to allow the Italy international to leave the club before the start of next season after narrowly missing out on Serie A glory earlier this month.A bid of at least £51million would reportedly be needed for United to stand any chance of landing Bastoni, who registered 44 appearances for Inter over the course of this season after representing his country on their way to Euro 2020 supremacy last summer. The Italian giants are looking to free up their wage bill as a matter of priority, though, which suggests that a lower fee could ultimately be negotiated in order to facilitate Bastoni's departure in the near future. JUST IN: Eddie Nketiah's stance on Arsenal stay as 'final contract offer' made It seems likely that Ten Hag will look to sign at least one new first-choice defender before taking charge of his first Premier League match at United, with the likes of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof having struggled to impress with consistency over the course of this season. A number of potential targets have been mentioned in connection with the Red Devils alongside Bastoni in recent weeks including Villarreal defender Pau Torres, who was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford a year ago but ultimately stayed with his current employers.Ajax defender Jurrien Timber has also been tipped to join United by following Ten Hag to Manchester in advance of the new campaign, while Jules Kounde of Sevilla and Sporting prospect Goncalo Inacio are said to be among the other names on the club's radar. However, former England defender Paul Parker has already suggested that Ten Hag could fail to attract Europe's biggest stars due to the immense pressure that comes with representing a club like United. "If you go out and buy one great player, he’s not going to come to Manchester United because he knows it’s going to be too much pressure put on him," Parker recently told The Sun."So United is about to try to get quality players to come to them, because they know if they go there expectations are going to be too much."As much as they want to play for Manchester United and put themselves in that position, there’s only so much you want to put on yourself, because you don’t really want the Harry Maguire treatment, do you?"
