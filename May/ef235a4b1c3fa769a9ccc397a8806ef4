EuroMillions lottery draws are among several organised by the National Lottery a week that could see ticketholders become multi-millionaires. The May 27 draw is no different, with an eight-figure £14 million jackpot in the balance tonight. But hopefuls don't have much time left to throw their numbers into consideration. EuroMillions organisers release winning numbers for their competition after ticket sales close. The competition closed at 7.30pm, with results following at 8.45pm. Tonight's winning numbers are 15, 23, 28, 34 and 48, and the two Lucky Stars are 03 and 05.

The numbers - five "main" and two Lucky Stars - will net them the £14 million jackpot. Anyone who misses out on the opportunity will have several other prizes for which they can contend. EuroMillions has provided 13 additional runner up prizes that could net people between £1 million and £2.50. Tonight's EuroMillions draw comes with the following prizes: Five matching numbers and two Lucky Stars: £14 million jackpot Five matching numbers and one Lucky Star: £130,554.30 Five matching numbers: £13,561.20 Four matching numbers and two Lucky Stars: £844.70 Four matching numbers and one Lucky Star: £77.80 Three matching numbers and two Lucky Stars: £37.30 Four matching numbers: £25.60 Two matching numbers and two Lucky Stars: £9.10 Three matching numbers and one Lucky Star: £7.30 Three matching numbers: £6.00 One matching number and two Lucky Stars: £4.30 Two matching numbers and one Lucky Star: £3.60 Two matching numbers: £2.50 The remaining prize is the Millionaire Maker, a guaranteed £1 million sum players can win if they match a code on the back of their tickets. While the host of generous prizes tonight will see two people become new millionaires, the sums don't quite match up to one recent winner. One ticket holder who entered a draw completed this month on May 10 won £184,262,899.10. The jackpot, the largest in UK history, was claimed on May 19 by Joe Thwaite of Gloucester. Mr Thwaite, 49, bought a Lucky Dip ticket via the National Lottery app earlier this month. He said he and his wife had chosen to share the jackpot with their family. Hairdresser Mrs Thwaite told lottery administrators Camelot they would "share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends". She added she had "kind of been ready to win for years" as Mr Thwaite said they would use their "good fortune" to "spend more time together".
