Janette Manrara, 38, and Aljaz Skorjanec, 32, looked fantastic as they soaked up the sun in Miami. The Strictly Come Dancing stars kicked off their holiday with a refreshing day by the pool while they spent time with Janette’s family. The Cuban-American dancer took to her Instagram account earlier today to share a sneak peek into their fun-filled day with her 502,000 followers. One of the snaps showed the couple sharing a hug as they smiled for the camera, while in the other pictures the pair could be seen posing with some of Janette’s friends and family members. For the occasion, Janette opted for a one-piece swimsuit in blue tones, which she paired with sunglasses. Aljaz beamed as he splashed in the water with his wife in a colourful striped swimsuit. Janette was born in Miami, Florida, and is best known for appearing on Strictly Come Dancing and Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two.
