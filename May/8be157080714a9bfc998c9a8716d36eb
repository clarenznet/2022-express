  Liz, 56, shared an update with fans after finishing up filming for the day, giving her 2.3 million Instagram followers the opportunity to see her model her newest bikini. Yesterday, Liz lounged on the side of the pool in a skimpy black number held together by metal chain links. She could be seen stretching out her arms and legs as she dipped one hand into the water.  The star soaked up the sun in a pair of shades in front of a scenic backdrop, featuring the sea and some rolling hills off in the distance. “When filming wraps for the day,” she penned with a kissing emoji. Liz’s fans took to the comments section to compliment the glamorous model. “Absolutely breathtaking,” wrote Paul.
