Time is running out if you fancy upgrading to Virgin's fastest broadband speeds at a price that's pretty tough to beat. The UK Internet Service Provider (ISP) has been offering an epic discount on its Gig1 Fibre for the past week with customers currently able to sign up and get ultra-fast downloads for just £28 per month. Considering this plan is usually priced at £62 per month there's a big saving to be made but the ISP has confirmed this offer will end on May 15. If you weren't already aware, Gig1 features speeds in excess of 1,000Mbps which is around 14 times faster than the current UK average. Those with this technology beamed into their homes will be able to download a full HD movie to their TVs in under 40 seconds or whizz a blockbuster 50GB PS5 game to their console in around 7 minutes - that same game would take almost two hours via a standard 70Mbps connection. Along with that Gig1 plan being cheaper, Virgin has also slashed the price of its M200, M350 and M500 speeds with all of these plans also currently costing £28. Now, you might be thinking that this deal sounds too good to be true and there must be a catch? Virgin has confirmed that users will get that low price for the first six months of the deal with things then rising to the standard price.
