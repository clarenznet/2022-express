This will be double the total inherited by the Conservatives after the 2010 election, say pensions experts Lane Clark & Peacock. Senior Tories hit out at the "hugely concerning" number being dragged into higher tax. In his March 2021 Budget, Mr Sunak said the threshold for higher-rate tax (40 percent) would be frozen at £50,270 to 2026. He also froze tax-free personal allowances at £12,570. Lane Clark & Peacock say 2.5 million more voters will be dragged into 40 percent or additional 45 percent bands by 2024. This is due to a combination of the Chancellor's threshold freeze and fast-growing wages, compounded by inflation. The pensions consultancy estimated a record 6.78 million workers would be paying higher rates by 2024. That is not only double the total of 2010 but 58 percent higher than at the last general election in 2019. At present, 4.13 million pay the higher tax rate of 40 per cent, and a further 440,000 - who earn more than £150,000 - pay the additional rate of 45 per cent. There are different tax rates in Scotland. The research found if tax thresholds rose with inflation, only 800,000 of 2.5 million taxpayers forecast to be pushed into the 40 or 45 percent brackets would still face the higher rate. Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb, of Lane Clark & Peacock, said: "Freezing tax allowances and thresholds is the ultimate stealth tax." Tory ex-Cabinet minister David Davis said the number being dragged into the highest tax band was "hugely concerning". He added: "It's a real risk now that the party is going to lose its reputation for economic competence." Mr Sunak has also promised to cut the basic rate of income tax by 1p in 2024.
