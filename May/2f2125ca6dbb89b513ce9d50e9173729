Canelo Alvarez is looking to put on a show when he challenges Dmitry Bivol for the WBA light-heavyweight title in Las Vegas on Cinco de Mayo weekend. The Mexican pound-for-pound king is making the step up to 175lbs for the second time in his career, after his 11th-round demolition of Sergey Kovalev in November 2019, when he successfully claimed the WBO world title. Now Canelo is looking to write more history after clearing out the entire super-middleweight division within the space of a year to become the undisputed world champion at 168lbs. The 31-year-old is "willing to fight" anyone - even unified heavyweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk - but first Russian Bivol lies in wait. He is no mug either, boasting a record of 19-0 and a reputation as one of the world's most feared light-heavyweights. Yet he will have to turn in a near-perfect performance if he is to successfully defend his WBA strap, as Canelo targets yet another clean sweep at 175lbs.
