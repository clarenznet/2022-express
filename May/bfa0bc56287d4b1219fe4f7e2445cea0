According to new research, the cost of hiring a car in Europe is more expensive than ever before, with the average price soaring to £344 per week. That’s compared to just £199 in 2019, an increase of £145, according to icarhireinsurance.com. Once optional extras are added in like car seats for kids and additional drivers, the cost for a week in Europe can reach an eye-watering £700. The study looked at the cost of hiring a medium compact car for a week, from 28 May to 4 June 2022, in five destinations including Barcelona, Faro, Larnaca, Nice and Tenerife. Six rental companies were used including Sixt, Hertz, Avis, Budget, Enterprise and Europcar, with prices compared to the same week in 2019, reported the Independent. Prices varied depending on location with the average weekly car rental rates in 2022 range at their highest in Nice at £504, compared to £351 in 2019.

The research also factored in typical extras for a family which dramatically increased the bill. It’s believed that a combination of factors including a shortage of new cars and increased demand in the summer months have combined to cause the rise.

The study also looked at prices for three UK destinations, London, Manchester and Glasgow in 2022, although prices for 2019 were not available for comparison. The average weekly car rental rates in 2022 range from £344 in Manchester, £593 in London to £1,083 in Glasgow. It is thought that the additional Jubilee bank holiday this year has pushed up the prices as people seek mini-breaks with transport. Ernesto Suarez, founder and CEO of icarhireinsurance.com, said: “Prices for most things are going up, and car hire is no exception, but good deals are still available if you shop around. “Make sure you check the prices of any extras you may need, or the headline price may not end up being as good as you thought. “Also consider buying car hire excess insurance from a specialist insurance provider rather than the excess waivers sold at the rental desk.” A British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association spokesperson said: “Like the wider tourism sector, car rental prices will fluctuate depending on supply and demand trends. “Demand always peaks in the summer months and we would advise customers to book early and be willing to compromise on what type of vehicle they get. “There are a number of additional factors at play this year. “The rental sector has been hit hardest by the global shortage in new vehicle supply and has seen significant price inflation in the cars it has been able to purchase. “The sector faces similar cost inflation to many other businesses and is also having to invest heavily in preparing for an increasingly electrified fleet.”
