The fact that the country wants the Government to show leadership is clearly demonstrated in our polling, which found 83 percent of us want Boris Johnson to appoint a dedicated cost-of-living minister. This is about more than protecting bank balances. Lives are at stake. Charities are warning we may face "deep hardship like nothing we've seen in this country for many years". The full machinery of Government cranked into action when the pandemic hit Britain to stop the spread of the virus and prevent economic catastrophe. It would be calamitous and tragic if households are plunged into desperate poverty in the aftermath of the Covid era. -------------------------------   -------------------------------  Mr Sunak faces a challenge that would daunt any of his predecessors. Moral responsibility and electoral necessity demand that he takes action to protect both households and the national finances. He must also do everything in his power to ensure that unemployment does not rise and business confidence is not damaged just as it was beginning to rebuild in the wake of Covid and Brexit. We are fortunate that this crisis has not hit at a time of mass joblessness. If Mr Sunak had not protected jobs during the pandemic the nation would be in an even more desperate state. Once again, he must demonstrate courage, creativity and compassion.
