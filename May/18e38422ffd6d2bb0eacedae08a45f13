One eye-witness said: "A man wielding a hammer was threatening everyone and anyone. He tried to attack a member of staff through the drive-thru window." McDonald's is still attempting to get a clearer picture of what happened. Branch franchisee Eddie Leligdowicz said: "There was an incident on Sunday night and we don't know all the details yet. "A member of the public was acting in a threatening way. Access to the restaurant was closed to prevent him from coming into the restaurant and the police were called. "We are not sure what his issues or problems were, but staff acted properly by closing the doors and calling the police. The police dealt with it immediately. "The indoor restaurant was closed until the police arrived and dealt with the situation and then we reopened again. "Nobody was injured or hurt, which is the important thing. This individual needs to be dealt with by the authorities." Staffordshire Police are taking no further action against the man following the incident. A police spokesman said: "Officers were called to Daisy Bank Road following reports of a man in possession of a hammer. A firearms unit was dispatched to the scene. "A vulnerable man was identified and safeguarded by officers. No hammer was recovered. The man was left in the care of his family."
