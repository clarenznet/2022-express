The following article contains graphic images. Diana Kirk was attacked by a rat while she slept at her home in Bingham, Nottinghamshire. She was discovered by her husband at 5.45am last Monday. The 76-year-old, who has brain damage, sleeps downstairs in a hospital bed. She is cared for by her 85-year-old husband, John Kirk, and a care team. Mr Kirk was asleep upstairs when he heard a rat "scratching around" by his feet. He said he could not see well because of the dark room, but said it was evidently a large rodent. He heard the noise again at 1.30am, but went back to sleep. When he went downstairs to check on his wife just before 6am, he found her with "savage" injuries, saying there was "blood everywhere". The 85-year-old immediately called for an ambulance and also asked a neighbour for assistance. Ms Kirk was admitted to Queen's Medical Centre, remaining there until Thursday night. Speaking to Nottinghamshire Live about the incident, he said: "I've never seen anything like the injuries she had - you can see how bad they were from the pictures. "It was absolutely savage. "I went and knocked on the door of the young girl over the road as she is also always up early and so she helped. "They took Diana to the Queen's Medical Centre and she came back on Thursday night.

"There was blood everywhere." The following morning, a neighbour caught the rat by setting up a trap in the house. When Mr Kirk went to move the rat, trapped in a cage, to the patio from inside the house he said it went to try and bite him numerous times. A neighbour then killed the animal by shooting it four times with a pellet gun.
