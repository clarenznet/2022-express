TikTok user @jdeleon716 shared a simple and very effective hack to "trap and kill flies" that only requires three household items. All people need is a plastic bottle, brown sugar and honey. First, get an empty plastic bottle and cut the top off. Then, add a third of brown sugar and a full spoon of honey. Finally, add a cup of water and mix it together.

TikTok viewers tried the brown sugar method and many agreed the easy hack "works a treat". Sonia Cordeiro asked: "Does it really work? Anyone tried already?" Another user replied saying: "Yeah, I did it when I was in Croatia with Fanta to kill all the bees [and flies].  "You don’t even need honey just do it with a large orange soda bottle. "Even better and cheaper!" TikTok user Mary Mealey435 added: "That's great and so easy!" S. Romero recommended: "Pour the honey straight in the bottle and save the mess and time." Another effective hack to deter flies is placing water and a few coins in a sandwich bag. All people need is a sealable bag, water and a few coins. Fill the clear bag halfway with water, add five or six coins to the bag, squeeze the excess air and close the seal. Ideally, the bag should be placed by a window. User Laura Rusk commented saying: "I did this today, I hung it in the centre of the french doors into the conservatory, I’ve only seen one fly today, well worth a try!" Pest control expert at PriceYourJob.co.uk, Walter Murphy, advised: "The best way to get rid of flies is by making sure your home is clean and free of any sugary substances, rotting meat or other waste. "This will involve wiping down surfaces and emptying the bin as often as possible to prevent flies from lingering in your home. "You can also use natural repellents, such as apple cider vinegar, to get rid of flies."
