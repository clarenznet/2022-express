The National Lottery will reveal the winning numbers for its rollover Lotto jackpot this evening. Tonight you could be the recipient of a cool £5 million that would change your life forever. Tonight's draw is a rollover, meaning the jackpot is boosted. If no players match the main six numbers the jackpot is rolled over to create a bigger jackpot next week. There can be up to four rollovers, but if no one wins the main jackpot in any of those games the next Lotto game will become a “Must Be Won” draw. The Lotto can only roll over five times - ending in a Must Be Won draw.  Lotto is easy to play and the reward could be enormous. You can buy your tickets in-store at newsagents, supermarkets and petrol stations, or you can play online and via the National Lottery app. Playing online via the website or app means that your ticket is checked automatically, and you get an email notification if you win a prize.
