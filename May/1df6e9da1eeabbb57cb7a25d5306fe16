The actor was seen greeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with handshakes when they met on the red carpet in Leicester Square for the glamorous premiere of the latest Top Gun movie. Subsequently, he kindly offered to hold Kate’s hand as they walked up the steps. Kate didn’t refuse and gave her hand to Cruise, while the Prince stood beside her. However, Tom Cruise wasn’t seen bowing to the royal couple, as the traditional etiquette dictates. Even though there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting a member of the royal family, many people wish to observe the traditional manners. As a man, Tom Cruise would have slightly bowed his head, as a sign of respect to the Crown. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined the 59-year-old Hollywood star who arrived on the red carpet in Leicester Square for the premiere of his new film, which is taking place as a royal film performance. The couple arrived to cheers from onlookers and the flashes of cameras at the event, and were introduced to cast members. Prince William was wearing an Alexander McQueen tuxedo while Kate sported a black and white Roland Mouret dress. William was wearing Crocket & Jones loafers with "F-18" on them in a nod to the fighter jet flown by Cruise's character in the film. Tom Cruise said he and The Duke of Cambridge "have a lot in common" while on the red carpet for the UK premiere of Top Gun: Maverick. Speaking about his admiration for William, Cruise said: "We both love England, and we're both aviators, we both love flying." The actor also expressed his joy to be back on the red carpet, saying: "I love what I do, I've always enjoyed it and I'm enjoying it even more now. "Particularly after the last couple of years, just to have an event like this is extraordinary."
