Hundreds of firms say they have seen a rise in attacks since the start of the Ukraine war, prompting fears Russian hackers may target British companies more as London leads the international response to Moscow’s invasion. In total, 72 per cent of the 521 organisations said they had been attacked more since February 24. Cyber security firm Bridewell - which shared the shocking research with the Daily Express - also reveals 78 per cent of bosses are concerned they will be targeted. The National Cyber Security Centre - a part of the Government’s listening post GCHQ - says there are 13 sectors classified as Critical National Infrastructure. Much of the CNI is owned by private companies. Almost a quarter of the cyber chiefs also fear their systems are vulnerable to attacks. One in ten even admitted they are concerned their teams “wouldn’t be able to cope with a cyber warfare attack”. Concern over cyber warfare is significantly higher in the transport and aviation sector with 93 per cent worried about the threat of cyber warfare. Martin Riley, Director of Managed Security Services at Bridewell, said: “As attacks rise in sophistication and volume, operators of critical national infrastructure must collaborate more effectively and share intelligence needed to protect infrastructure and society. “Great progress has been made across the industry since the introduction of the NIS Regulations but it’s now imperative that organisations include threat intelligence in their cyber security strategies to strengthen resilience. “Developing a culture of information-sharing among peers and supply chains is key to protecting our infrastructure and citizens.”
