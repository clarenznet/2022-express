The big game from Seville is being broadcast on BT Sport, and usually you'd have to pay for either a BT Sport subscription or pick up a BT Sport Monthly Pass to get access to Europa League coverage. But for the final BT Sport is letting footie fans tune in for free, with the match being broadcast for free on YouTube. Both Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt have enjoyed a stunning journey to the Europa League final. Rangers beat two German heavyweights on their way to the big match at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. The Glasgow giants stunned Borussia Dortmund before later beating RB Leipzig to book their place in the final. While Eintracht Frankfurt swept aside European giants Barcelona in the quarter-final before beating David Moyes's West Ham in the semis. Both Rangers and Frankfurt have European silverware in their cabinet, but haven't tasted success for decades. Rangers' last glory in Europe was a Cup Winners Cup win in 1972, while for Frankfurt it was winning the UEFA Cup (which is the former Europa League) back in 1980.
