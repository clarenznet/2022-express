Images have recently emerged of Sir Keir Starmer, alongside Angela Rayner and a number of campaigners, having a beer and curry indoors together in April last year. Mixing with individuals outside of your household would have broken the lockdown rules at the time. When questioned on the images that emerged, Sir Keir said: "We were working in the office. It was just before the elections, we were busy. We paused for food, no party, no rules were broken. “That is the long and the short of it. All that's happened in the last week is that with local elections on the horizon, Conservative MPs have decided to chuck mud."  However, when asked whether Durham police have been back in contact with him regarding the event since inquiries were launched, Sir Keir appears to keep dodging the question. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: “Keir Starmer has used every trick in the book to attack the PM over his handling of events in No10, yet he doesn’t want to be held to the same standard the PM has subjected himself to. “He’s a hypocrite who should fess up to what really happened in Durham and explain why he thinks it’s any different to the hyperbole he levelled at the PM.” Do you think Sir Keir has grounds to continue arguing, or should he apologise?
