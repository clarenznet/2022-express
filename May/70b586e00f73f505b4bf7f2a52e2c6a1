It is the biggest figure since records began in 2007 and has jumped by 200,000 since March as the backlog for surgery such as hip replacements and cataracts shows no sign of abating. The NHS England data also revealed the number of people waiting more than a year for treatment rose from 299,478 in February to 306,286 in March. But the number waiting more than two years fell for the second month in a row, from 23,281 in February to 16,796 in March. However, this is still more than six times the 2,608 on the two-year list in April 2021. The total referred for treatment in March was 1.8 million. Yesterday experts called on the Government to tackle NHS staffing levels. Siva Anandaciva, of The King's Fund think tank, said: "Until ministers grasp the nettle on health and care staffing shortages, it will be patients who continue to pay the price by waiting longer in discomfort, pain and deteriorating health." National medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: "The latest figures are another reminder of the crucial importance of community and social care in helping people in hospital leave when they are fit to do so... because it helps free up precious NHS bed space." A record 24,138 waited more than 12 hours in A&E departments to be admitted to hospital last month - up from 22,506 in March. But the number waiting at least four hours to be admitted fell to 131,905, down from an all-time high of 136,298 the month before. The average response time for ambulances dealing with urgent incidents also fell, from a record nine minutes, 35 seconds in March to nine minutes, two seconds.
