This is equivalent to one in six deaths worldwide, a number virtually unchanged since the last analysis in 2015, said a report published in the Lancet. Lead author Richard Fuller said: "The health impacts of pollution remain enormous and low and middle-income countries bear the brunt. "Prevention is largely overlooked. Attention and funding have only minimally increased since 2015, despite increases in public concern about pollution and its health effects." Professor Philip Landrigan, director of the global public health programme, said: "Pollution is still the largest existential threat to human and planetary health." The health and social care costs of air pollution in England could reach Â£18.6billion by 2035, said a report by green charity Global Action Plan yesterday.
