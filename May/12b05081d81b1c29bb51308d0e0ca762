He called for violent criminals to be flogged and for penal labour camps. He was vehemently anti-homosexual, saying in 1986 that Aids sufferers were "swirling in a cesspit of their own making". Nowadays such views would have led to disciplinary action or even instant dismissal but Anderton remained at the helm of the force for 15 years. Many applauded his decision to increase foot patrols and wage war on vice and alcohol-fuelled offences. Cyril James Anderton was born in a humble two-up two-down cottage inWigan which had a shared outside lavatory. His father James was a coal miner and his mother Lucy was a factory worker. His parents enjoyed bible readings and regularly attended church. Baptised an Anglican, Anderton became a Methodist lay preacher and later a Roman Catholic. He was said to start each day with prayers and often prayed throughout the day. While at Wigan Grammar School he considered entering the ministry but after National Service he joined the Manchester city police force. He reached the rank of chief inspector by the age of 25 and by 1975 he was deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester. While in the top job he was rarely out of the news, much to the annoyance of the Home Office and the police authority, but his personal courage was never questioned. When riots broke out in the 1980s he joined fellow officers on the street to restore peace. He is survived by wife Joan and their daughter Gillian.
