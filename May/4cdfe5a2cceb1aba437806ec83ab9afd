Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are on collision course for a blockbuster quarter-final at the French Open. And the winner could meet new star Carlos Alcaraz in the semis after the draw was made at Roland Garros on Thursday night. Fellow teenager Emma Raducanu will learn her first-round opponent on Friday after drawing a qualifier in her first-ever match in Paris. But the men’s draw produced a loaded top half of the draw containing the three favourites - and British No.1 Cam Norrie. Djokovic and Nadal have played 58 times, with the Serb winning their last match in the semi-finals here last year. The world No.1 is seeking to equal Nadal’s record of 21 Grand Slam titles. World No.6 Alcaraz arrives in red-hot form after winning his last two events in Madrid and Barcelona. The 19-year-old is drawn to face Norrie in the fourth round and then could have to overcome world No.3 Alex Zverev to face the winner of Nadal-Djokovic match.   Norrie will open against French wildcard Guinard Manuel. No.29 seed Dan Evans will start against Argentine Francisco Cerundolo. No.12 seed Raducanuis scheduled to face former world No.1 Angelique Kerber in the third round and then the in-form Ons Jabeur in the last 16. Heather Watson will play in the first round against French wildcard Elsa Jaquemot while Harriet Dart takes on Italian Martina Trevisan. See the 2022 French Open draw as it happened below...
