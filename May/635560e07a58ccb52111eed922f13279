Rapper Nicki Minaj, 39, was left fighting to avoid a wardrobe malfunction as she arrived at the Met Gala 2022 on Monday. Nicki’s strapless Burberry gown was so low-cut that it barely covered her chest and she had to hold her hands over her top half to try and keep her assets in place. Nicki walked the red carpet in her custom dress with Burberry’s creative director, Riccardo Tisci. The floor length ensemble featured leather trousers under a tiered skirt and a large belt to cinch the rapper in at the waist. Nicki accessorized with a leather cap, while her arms, chest and face were bedazzled with crystals. In a red-carpet interview with La La Anthony, Nicki said she wanted to address her outfit’s “unplanned” sizing issue. She said: “I want to tell everybody that the only unplanned thing about my look is my boobs popping out. “They made my cup size a little small. “Enjoy these ti****s, ’cause y’all ain’t gonna see them ever again,” she jokingly added to Vogue.
