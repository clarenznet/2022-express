Players won't have to match any bonus balls, but their tickets still need six matching numbers. For today's draw, the bonus ball is vital for those hoping to win a runner-up prize. Those who miss out on the jackpot could still win between £1 million and a free lucky dip. The prizes up for grabs tonight include: Six matching numbers: £8.5 million jackpot Five matching numbers and matching bonus ball: £1 million Five matching numbers: £1,750 Four matching numbers: £140 Three matching numbers: £30 Two matching numbers: Free lucky dip Today's draw follows an eight-figure EuroMillions competition on May 24, which remains unclaimed. One player could still claim the £44 million jackpot by matching seven numbers - five "main numbers" and another two lucky stars. Yesterday's winning numbers were 10, 13, 27, 36, and 3, with lucky stars of 2 and 10. People could also win £1 million via a Millionaire Maker, which required them to match a code on the back of one of their lottery tickets. The National Lottery requires the luckiest players - who have won more than £30,000 - to call the organisation's claim line on 0333 234 44 33. Prizes over £50,000 are paid in person, while winners claiming anything between £500 and £50,000 must visit their local post office. The National Lottery deposits any prize below £500 into the winner's bank account, and all winnings must be claimed within 180 days.
