Manchester United will have a near complete reshuffle of their coaching staff when Erik ten Hag arrives, but the Dutchman has reportedly made it clear he wants Eric Ramsay to stay at the club. Ten Hag has been tasked with turning things around at Old Trafford after what has been yet another frustrating campaign for United. There were high hopes the club were heading in the right direction under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following their second-placed finish last season. The signings of Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo also had some United fans dreaming of a potential title challenge. But the good mood from the transfer window quickly dissipated with Solskjaer dismissed in November. Ralf Rangnick was initially able to steady the ship after arriving as the interim boss, but that was only temporary with United now unable to secure Champions League football for next season. Several players will be leaving with their contracts coming to an end while others face serious questions on their futures. Ten Hag will arrive next month to begin his overhaul of the playing squad, but he'll also make some big changes behind the scenes.
