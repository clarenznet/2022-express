Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy joined wife Rebekah Vardy in High Court for the first time on day six of the 'Wagatha Christie' trial, an ongoing libel dispute with Coleen Rooney. The former England forward's presence is of extra significance though because on Tuesday, his former international team-mate Wayne Rooney is due to give evidence in support of his wife, who has "hated every minute" of the experience.  Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer has been present in court throughout the multi-million-pound trial following the conclusion of the Championship season with Derby County. Until now, Rooney has remained silent in the courtroom but now he has been invited up the witness box, when he is likely to be asked about an alleged exchange with ex-team-mate Vardy. In the past few days, the 36-year-old has remained silent as wife Coleen documented the strains tabloid intrusion has created on their marriage over the years. Rooney is understood to have exchanged a polite nod with Foxes forward Vardy as the pair sat down next to their wives to begin the continuation of the trial. As per Coleen Rooney's witness statement, Rooney - as captain of England at Euro 2016 - is alleged to have advised Jamie that his wife had made a mistake agreeing to write a column for The Sun. Rooney is also understood to have been unaware that his wife was conducting a sting operation in a bid to find out who was accessing her Instagram account. Coleen later alleged that Rebekah Vardy was the perpetrator, prompting her to sue for libel.
