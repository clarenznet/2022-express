Despite a cross-party campaign, supported by actress Ruthie Henshall, ministers have refused to make unrestricted visits to care homes and hospitals a legal right. In a letter signed by MPs Tracey Crouch, Dan Carden, Daisy Cooper and Liz Saville-Roberts, the Health Secretary was asked to intervene. It said: "There continue to be shocking instances of denial of any contact, with tragic consequences for the resident, patient or service users... this was exacerbated by, but is not exclusive to, the pandemic." Asked if the Care Quality Commission watchdog backs laws to make visits a legal right, its chief inspector Kate Terroni would not reply. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was "closely reviewing" if further action was needed.
