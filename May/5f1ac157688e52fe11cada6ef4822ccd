While people who live in Sunderland, Leeds and Manchester have already received their £150 council tax rebate, others are still waiting. Most local authorities are planning to pay the rebate this week, here’s the full list so far according to The Mirror. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in February that all households in council tax bands A to D would receive a £150 council tax rebate this year to help them pay soaring energy bills. Some 80 percent of properties in England are entitled to this one-off payment from the Government to help them with the cost of living. While some people have already received the payout into their bank accounts, others have been wondering where the money is. The good news is households who pay their council tax bill by monthly direct debit are expected to get their £150 this week.

Britons who don’t pay by direct debit will need to apply for the one-off payment through their local council. Households who fall into bands E, F, G and H won’t be eligible for the £150 council tax rebate, however they can apply for help through their council’s discretionary Household Support Fund. Meanwhile, anyone who is in their overdraft should speak to their bank before the council tax rebate is made to ensure it’s not swallowed up.

Westminster Council recently issued a warning on its website which said: "If you are overdrawn, you can exercise your first right of appropriation on the £150 payment, so that your bank doesn’t use it to pay off your overdraft." The National Debt website has a sample letter for households to use if they wish to exercise their right of appropriation, which can be downloaded and emailed to banks if needed. Often this won’t be necessary and a simple call to the bank will suffice, however, it’s best to act sooner rather than later. While some people will be desperate for the refund,  Britons are being warned not to fall for a council tax refund scam doing the rounds. Councils would never cold call someone to ask for their bank details over the phone. People should hang up straight away if they receive a call like this. They can report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. What is happening where you live?
