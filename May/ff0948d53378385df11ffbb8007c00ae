Britain and the US will work together on commercial trips, said the Transport Secretary and his American counterpart Pete Buttigieg. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the move will help launch quicker and more streamlined operations. The first flight from UK soil is due to leave Spaceport Cornwall this year. Mr Shapps said: “This transformational partnership is one giant leap for both countries, as we prepare for an exciting new era. “With seven spaceports being developed across the UK, the space industry is already injecting billions into our economy, while offering high-skilled jobs.” UK space-related organisations produced £16.5billion in income, supporting around 47,000 jobs, in 2020. The UK will cut its reliance on other launch countries to put home-built and operated satellites into space to provide critical defence security, better weather forecasts and improved television. Dan Hart, chief executive at commercial space firm Virgin Orbit, said: “This agreement between the US and the UK will accelerate collaboration. We are committed to doing our part by conducting the first-ever launch from the UK later this year with a wonderful mix of payloads from our two countries.” Mr Buttigieg, the US Transportation Secretary, said: “We’re proud to launch this partnership.”
