 Infuriated travellers have blasted the "bad organisation" of the French border control. One described it as a "total outrage", adding they had been queuing for three hours and expected even more. Another said they had been "waiting almost two hours and have already missed our ferry". They described the situation as "seriously bad organisation". Others report moving just 100 metres in the space of hours, while more add that they have queued for a total of six hours.  Traffic remains at a standstill on the A2 Jubilee Way. One lane is also closed on the A20 coastbound from Roundhill Tunnel due to Dover TAP being implemented this morning. Bus company Stagecoach has also tweeted to say it is unable to serve certain bus routes in Dover due to the problems. The huge congestionÂ comes amid an event-packed weekend, with fans heading to the Champions League final in Paris yesterday and families leaving for Europe for school's half term and the Platinum Jubilee.
