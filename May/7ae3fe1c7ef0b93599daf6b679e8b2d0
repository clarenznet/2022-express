Kylie Jenner sent jaw's dropping at last night's glitzy Met Gala in New York when she turned up in a giant wedding dress complete with a veil and backwards baseball cap. The Kardashian, 24, took to the red carpet in a stunning gown by the late designer Virgil Abloh, but it wasn't long before Smile hitmaker Lily Allen, 37, weighed in on the reality star's bizarre choice of outfit. Kylie graced the glitzy event in an off-white wedding dress that resembled a giant meringue. The ruffles spilled out of the garnement and trailed along the floor, leaving her aides rushing to pick up the fabric over the course of the night. The top half of the garment featured a white corset which held the star's ample assests tightly in and had been paired with a round-neck, mesh t-shirt. Kylie finished off her look with a white baseball cap which she wore back to front.

Lily Allen soon took to social media to react after one fan pointed out the similarities between Kylie's Met Gala dress and one of Lily's outfit's that she wore to V-Festival over 15 years ago. They wrote: "@kyliejenner is giving off @lilyallen at the 2006 V Festival vibes." Lily reposted the comparison snap and simply wrote, "lol."
