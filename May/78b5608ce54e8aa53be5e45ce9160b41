Sharon Stone turned heads today as she arrived for the screening of new film Elvis at the Cannes Film Festival. The Basic Instinct actress, 64, stunned onlookers as she wore a pair of the musician's signature aviator sunglasses to greet the crowd.  Sharon graced the glitzy event in a skintight, red dress which skimmed the floor. The stunning garment featured a split up the back which allowed the actress to flaunt her toned pins. Intricate beading adorned the neckline and shoulder straps of the dress, adding a touch of glamour to the number. She paired the bright gown with an equally colourful red clutch bag, which perfectly matched the cherry-red hue. The finishing piece to her outfit was the pair of aviator sunglasses she wore as she posed expertly for snaps. The Basic Instinct actress waved happily to onlookers while keeping the shades firmly over her eyes.
