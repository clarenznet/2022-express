Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton caused a stir today in a hot pink outfit while attending the Miami Grand Prix. The star, 37, was snapped in the brightly-coloured ensemble as he made his way into the paddock ahead of the first running of the race. Appearing at the racing event, the star caused a stir in a neon pink oversized t-shirt and matching baggy trousers and trainers. He finished the look with a square pair of purple sunglasses. A large watch could be seen on Hamilton's wrist while he wore a large chain around his neck. It comes as the star became embroiled in a row over his jewellery ahead of the inaugural Miami Grand Prix today.

The British Mercedes driver, who mostly wears his jewellery out of the car, said that during racing he only wears “earrings and nose ring, which I can't remove”. He removed some of his jewellery in the car for the Miami GP and has been given a two-race exemption for pieces that are more difficult to take out.
