Instagram model Demi Rose Mawby showcased her curves in a floaty floor length dress as she posed for the cameras in Ibiza, Spain. The dreamy island location is a place she has previously described as her "home". Demi attracted Kardashian comparisons for her shapely derriere, paired with her slim and toned waist which were on display thanks to the open back design of the dress. The front featured a plunging neckline, with a peach satin bustier top section, plus her long and colourful skirt boasted a slit up one side. The model also looked the picture of innocence in her previous post, where she guzzled from a glass while wrapping herself in a sheer white dress with a crocheted lace trip. Reclining beside a bathtub in an all-white backdrop, her hair was styled into loose and languid waves. "Don't go wasting my emotions," she warned in the caption of her post. "No salt no Sugar no wasting her emotions," @vincewilliamss quipped in response. @savannahpetrovic75 added: "I'm head over heels in love!" Meanwhile @kennethstyle86 opted to send Demi a poem, writing: "Earth shattering, Hips flattering, Her inner beauty is vibrating... She owns her Power." So far, the buxom beauty has accumulated almost 20 million followers for her sensual snaps. However one told her today: "You don't have to dress up!"
