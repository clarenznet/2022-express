The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) announced the arrival of the two tiny Northern rockhopper penguin chicks at Edinburgh Zoo on Thursday. An adorable video shows one of the tiny animals being cared for by its mother. Keepers were delighted to welcome the little chicks and will be monitoring their development. When they are ready they will be moved with the rest of the colony where visitors will be able to see them. The zoo hopes its gentoo penguin eggs will also begin hatching in the coming weeks. Dawn Nicoll, senior penguin keeper at Edinburgh Zoo, said: “Northern rockhopper penguins are endangered due to climate change, changes in marine ecosystems and overfishing, so it is really exciting to welcome these new chicks. "The first 30 days are critical for their development, so we will be keeping a close eye on them at this sensitive time. “Our gentoo penguins are sitting on eggs too, and we hope they will begin to hatch in the coming weeks. "All going well, it won't be long before visitors can spot the youngsters with the rest of our colony at Penguins Rock. “Every visit to the zoo helps care for the amazing animals, like our penguins, and supports our charity’s vital conservation work around the world.” RZSS is part of the European breeding programme for Northern rockhopper penguins. The charity has also worked to help safeguard the species in the wild for many years.
