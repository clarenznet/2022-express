Everton boss Frank Lampard has rubbed salt into the wounds of his former side Chelsea after he celebrated Richarlison's opening goal wildly at Goodison Park. The Toffees went into the clash against the Blues five points adrift of 17th-placed Leeds in their bid for survival after a torrid run of form. A feisty first half saw the sides go into the interval level, with Everton having the lions' share of chances on Merseyside. But Lampard's men came flying out of the blocks in the first minute of the second half, and after Richarlison stole the ball off Cesar Azpilicueta the Brazilian slotted home to send Goodison Park into raptures. Fans, players and staff alike were celebrating wildly with a win likely to make either Burnley or Leeds favourites to go down due to the Toffees' favourable run in. And nobody was celebrating more than Lampard despite taking the lead against his former side, with the ex-England international frantically running up and down the touchline in glee. **We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures, and video on this breaking news story.
