Brussels ambassador to London, Joao Vale de Almeida, said no “credible alternative” to the protocol had been identified and warned that Ms Truss' proposed unilateral action to override it could “nix” the agreement altogether. Mr Vale de Almeida said the two sides "need to create a better atmosphere". Speaking in Westminster, he said the EU has "low levels of trust" in the UK.

It comes after the EU warned it would take retaliatory measures if the UK presses ahead with Liz Truss's plans to take unilateral action to scrap part of the trade deal. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
