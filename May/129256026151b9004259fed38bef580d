David Beckham, 47, enjoyed a night out with his middle son, Romeo, and his model girlfriend Mia Regan, both 19. The trio ate dinner at COTE, a Korean steakhouse in Miami. Detailing the evening on his Instagram story, David joked that he was “third wheeling”. The football ace posted a snap from outside the restaurant to his 72.9 million followers. His family cut a casual figure wearing hoodies and David and Romeo sported matching black caps. They beamed at the camera as Romeo proudly held his arm around his stunning girlfriend. In a follow-up post, David thanked restaurant owner, Simon Kim, and told fans the food was "amazing as always". The Beckhams had been to the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday. Romeo shared a series of snaps on his own Instagram page, telling his 3.5 million followers that it had been a great “experience”. The race was attended by a host of A-listers including Serena Williams, Michelle Obama, Michael Jordan and NFL star Tom Brady.
