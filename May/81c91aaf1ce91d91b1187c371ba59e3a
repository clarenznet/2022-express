PS4 fans that want to upgrade and get a PS5 or Xbox Series X should double check they have a rare and expensive game in their collection. Retro gaming website PriceCharting has released new figures for games and consoles that have shot up in price recently. And one rare game will be of particular interest to PS4 gamers, as the title released for Sony's console is worth more than a PS5 or Xbox Series X console. This game is the collector's edition of Yoko Taro's critically acclaimed and brilliant NieR Automata. A loose version of this PS4 game (i.e missing box) is worth a whopping £538. A complete boxed copy is worth £649, while a brand new version will set you back over £1,000. This new pricing information was revealed in a recent Hot Items list released by PriceCharting. This gives a rundown of the games or consoles which have experienced the biggest price jump in the past week. If you're lucky to have this version of NieR in your collection, and are looking to get a next-gen console, it means you could sell it and put the funds towards a PS5 or Xbox Series X - if you're looking to save a bit of cash.
