Danni Menzies, 32, shared a post documenting her time hanging out with her A Place In The Sun co-stars while in Leeds yesterday. It appeared the cast were having a great time as they posed for a group photo including, Danni, Jonnie Irwin, Leah Charles King and Jean Johansson. Jonnie, 48, looked trendy as he wore sunglasses and a black short-sleeved shirt as the boozy afternoon appeared to become raucous. The father-of-three grabbed onto Danni’s thigh while she kicked her leg in the air and still managed to hold on to her glass of champagne. The Scottish beauty was dressed ready for the soaring temperatures as she put on a bright green top and white skirt for the UK heatwave. Meanwhile, Jean and Leah wowed in bright ensembles at the cast party.
