BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor predicted temperatures wavering from between 11C to 21C in certain parts of the country. Most Britons can expect breezier winds and sunny spells on Saturday and over the weekend courtesy of an area of "polar" air being pushed in. And on Sunday there will be some small outbreaks of patchy showers in the North East, with Mr Taylor predicting chillier weather around the Eastern coastal regions of the UK.  Mr Taylor said: "Now as we go into the weekend it will be a sunny start for many. "But gradually turning cooler, a few showers around as well, especial by Sunday. "Not too many showers on Saturday, mildly but that breeze is now in a more Northernly direction. "North and East of Scotland blustery down in those North sea coasts of England.   Mr Taylor added: "But notice only a bit of cloud building up through the day. "For a vast majority a dry day on Saturday, a sunny day as well. "17C and 18C in South West Scotland, 20C to 21C, towards some Southern coastal counties of England and Wales. "But as high pressure just pushes off towards Iceland as we go through into Sunday.  Mr Taylor said: "We start to drag in even cooler air all the way down from polar regions. "Ok, it's not going to have as much impact as it's going to have in the winter. "But it will certainly feel cooler over the next couple of days. "There will be more rain and showers around, and more in the way of cloud too.  Mr Taylor added: "But still some sunny spells to be had, particularly in some shelters Southern areas. "And out towards Ireland, the temperatures on Sunday down those Eastern coasts is particularly chilly. "Around 11C or 12C, the highest towards the South West. "And The big theme is it turns cool this weekend your going to notice if you're off to Radio One's big weekend."
