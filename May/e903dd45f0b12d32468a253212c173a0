The 75th annual Cannes Film Festival is currently on its fourth day, with Hollywood's Tilda Swinton and Idris Elba attending for the screening of their latest film, Three Thousand Years Of Longing (Trois Mille Ans A T'Attendre). However, not all went smoothly on this evening's red carpet as a topless protester surrounded the celebrities. The women bared all with a Ukranian flag painted onto her chest, with "Stop raping us" written over her chest. She only wore a pair of knickers that were covered in fake blood, with handprints and red marks covering the area. Celebrities including Victoria Secret's Alessandra Ambrosio could be seen being protected by a bodyguard as security tried to deal with the situation. The protester took to the floor screaming as she was surrounded by security covering her modesty with a black jacket. She could then be seen being escorted off the premises. Her protest comes as news has hit that women across Ukraine are grappling the threat of rape as a weapon of war. There has been growing evidence of sexual violence emerging in areas dominated by Russian soliders. Russian forces still control vast swathes of Ukrainian territory and population. In every region that gets liberated, reports emerge of horrific war crimes.
