Customers were left disappointed after discovering the option was no longer available in all three terminals.Â Initially, the airport said passengers could book the express service outside of peak hours, but when queried by Manchester Evening News they found they were unable to do so. Now it has been confirmed that outbound passengers cannot purchase a pass in person or online to bypass queues in any of the terminals, but bookings made prior to the suspension will be honoured. However, travellers can still pay to use an express lane through Passport Control in Terminal One. Passengers had been taking full advantage of the FastTrack service allowing them to avoid the 60 to 90 minute delays caused by staff shortages. A statement on Manchester Airport's website reads: "We are currently unable to offer our security FastTrack service to customers online. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, please check back regularly for reopening dates. "Passport control FastTrack is still available at Terminal 1." It is understood that the express lane in Terminal One will allow the airport to deliver a standard of service close to what customers expect from a FastTrack product.   One passenger, who is due to fly out today, shared their dread over the potential queues which could await them. They said: "After seeing the recent delays at Manchester Airport, we tried to book the FastTrack security passes a few weeks before our flights but didn't have the option. "It seems as though bookings fast-track for Terminal 2 have been closed for a while now. "It's quite disappointing as being able to book would take the stress off a bit. We're now bracing ourselves for possible chaos, and will be relieved once we're through the airport and on the plane."
