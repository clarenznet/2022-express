The former Brexit Party leader said the "biggest Brexit betrayal" is behind fisheries and illegal immigration "worries us" and put a "big burden" on the UK. Mr Farage said: â€œWhy did we vote for Brexit? What was the main driver? I tell you what it was, open borders, it was people seeing the population of Britain rising rapidly and of course, we go on about illegal immigration all the time." He said the level of immigration is "huge", claiming the UK is "heading for a record year of net migration". He continued: "This is not what we voted for either in the referendum or when we gave Boris Johnson a massive majority of 80." FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
