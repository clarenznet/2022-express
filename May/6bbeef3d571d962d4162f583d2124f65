Irregular brown patches during dry weather These types of patches tend to be caused by a lack of soil moisture. According to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) the best way to tackle these is by treating your lawn for drought-related problems. It advised tackling brown patches in the autumn months. The RHS said: "This will help the lawn to recover from recent drought but will also make it more drought resistant the following year." During this time, over-seed any sparse areas using an appropriate mixture and refrain from using lawn weedkillers or feeds on patches. If the lawn is in a particularly bad state, you may need to repair or relay your lawn.
