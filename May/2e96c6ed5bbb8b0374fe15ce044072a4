The RHS Chelsea Flower is one of the biggest events of the year for keen amateur and professional gardeners. this year, some 39 gardens were on display, made up of 13 Show Gardens, 12 Sanctuary Gardens, four Balcony Gardens, five Container Gardens, four All About Plants gardens and one Feature Garden. RHS judges put the gardens to the test on Monday as the show opened, and awarded the winning designers with medals. But with all gardens on show this year proving a real treat for the eye, there's plenty more to see then just the Gold, Silver and Bronze medal winners - and we have some of the best pictures here.
