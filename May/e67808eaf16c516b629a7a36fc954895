His music for Hugh Hudson’s 1981 film, which won four Oscars, including for its soundtrack, was composed at Vangelis’s London studio, Nemo, which he set up in 1975 after moving from Athens. Vangelis himself played the Yamaha synthesiser, drums, acoustic piano and percussion to create what many regard as the perfect film score. Although it was a breakthrough in his career, he did not regard the piece as his finest work. He thought his soundtrack for Mutiny On The Bounty was better while some critics say his best work was on Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou was born in Agria in central Greece but grew up in Athens, where he learned to play music by ear. When he was four he put nails, chains and cutlery inside his parents’ grand piano to see what sounds such objects would make on the strings. While studying at the Athens School of Fine Arts, he came up with the name Vangelis and formed a band, Formynx. Following the military coup he travelled to Paris where, in 1968, he formed Aphrodite’s Child with fellow emigres Loukas Sideras and Demis Roussos. They made a double album, 666, which became a psychedelic cult classic. He married French photographer Veronique Skawinska but they got divorced. His second wife, Greek-born singer Vana Veroutis, featured in some of his music.  Travelling constantly between London, Athens and Paris meant he had no time to have children, he told one interviewer. As he could not read or write music, he recorded discs of his compositions and then had them transcribed for orchestras. His lifelong fascination with space inevitably led to him working closely with Nasa and the European Space Agency, which broadcast into space a musical tribute he had composed to mark the death of Stephen Hawking.
