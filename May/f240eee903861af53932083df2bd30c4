The middle-aged couple unintentionally exposed their private moment in front of all the viewers of the ceremony. The candid accident occurred on May 14 during a live-streaming of a Bat Mitzvah in a synagogue in Minnesota, USA. Apparently, the couple was unaware their camera was turned on and so they indulged in love-making as the religious ritual was ongoing. Much to the frustration of other viewers, they went on for about 45 minutes, according to the New York Post. Some people tried to contact the couple to get them to stop, with messages and phone calls. When they realised what was happening, they were clearly terrified and rushed to cut the scene. An unnamed person who was on the Zoom call told the New York Post: “She was walking around naked, she got dressed, she’s in and out of the Zoom. “He was in the bed, he whipped it out, she started going to work. It went on for about 45 minutes. “Someone on the Zoom saw and called her and was like, ‘WTF are you doing? You’re on camera.’ - she freaked out.” Asked about the occasion, the viewer said: “It was a Zoom for a bat mitzvah. “Most people were not on camera except like, the old bubbes who don’t know how to turn off their camera, and these two people. “So the boxes were pretty big and everyone could see who was on camera.” A spokesperson of the Temple Beth El, where the Bat Mitzvah was taking place, declined to comment. He said: “I’m aware of the incident and won’t be commenting on the details.” Although not in public view, sex between husband and wife is among the activities that are encouraged by Judaism to take place on Shabbat, when the rituals also happen. But the couple is not the first to have made a raunchy blunder while on a Zoom call.
