Christian Horner's wife Geri Halliwell 49, hasnâ€™t worn any colour in years. Nowadays, the former pop star, who is married to the Formula One boss, always wears white. She had fans doing a double take after she took to Instagram on Friday and unveiled a surprising new look. The supportive wife left fans in disbelief when she shared a photo posing with her husband, Christian, 48, wearing an outfit that wasn't white! Geri opted for another colour instead, in a knee-length, sleeveless cream dress and a matching jumper draped across her shoulders. She added a pair of elegant off-white, heeled sandals and a multi-coloured bag featuring shades of purple, white and green. Christian sported a pair of cream trousers, which he teamed with a navy shirt and matching suit jacket. Geri shared the sweet snap, in view of her 1.3 million followers. Fans flocked to the comment section, as Tom wrote: "That is not white." Lydnsey quizzed: "No white?" while Caz confirmed: "Cream."
