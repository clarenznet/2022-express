The spaniel, Marshall, was spotted on CCTV cowering in fear at a supported living home in Devon while a teenager kicked him, hit him, picked him up by his neck and threw him onto a sofa. The RSPCA asked for help from Devon and Cornwall Police to seize the dog and take him into their care. The spaniel was fostered by an experienced handler before starting his training course in November 2021. RSPCA Inspector Beccy Wadey, who investigated the case, said Marshall, who is full of energy, was fostered by a dog handler at Gloucestershire Police last November and is now a cash, drugs and firearms detection dog.
