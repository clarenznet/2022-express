The Scottish comedian, 79, will be honoured after a career spanning more than five decades at the Virgin Media Bafta TV Awards on Sunday evening. The Big Yin was diagnosed with the progressive neurological disorder in 2013. He quit live shows five years later but continues to make TV appearances. He said: "I don't let the Parkinson's dictate who I am. I just get on with it. I've had a very successful career and I have no regrets at all. "I am deeply honoured. Fifty films and I can't remember how many TV shows, as well as my stage comedy, added up to something that's a joy to look back on. A lovely thing. "I had no idea the Fellowship existed - but I'm told it's a big deal! It's lovely to be recognised and to become a jolly good fellow." The star, who lives in the US, will not attend the ceremony but a recorded message will be played.
