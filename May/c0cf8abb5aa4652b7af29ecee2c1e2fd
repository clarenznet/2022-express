Patron has been credited with detecting more than 200 explosives since the start of the war. The Jack Russell terrier and his owner Myhailo Iliev, a major in the Civil Protection Service, were presented with the medal in recognition of their work by the Ukrainian President at a ceremony in Kyiv on Sunday. The pint-sized pooch barked and wagged his tail as his owner was handed the award, prompting laughter from the audience. The two-and-a-half-year-old dog has become a symbol of Ukrainian patriotism during the war. Mr Zelensky described Patron as a "wonderful little sapper". The Ukrainian leader said: "Today, I want to award those Ukrainian heroes who are already clearing our land of mines. "And together with our heroes, a wonderful little sapper - Patron - who helps not only to neutralise explosives, but also to teach our children the necessary safety rules in areas where there is a mine threat." Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also present and patted his pockets like he was looking for treats. Patron has become a national hero amid Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. The little dog, who wears a safety vest when at work, has amassed more than 200,000 followers on Instagram. He regularly appears in videos on official Ukrainian social media accounts.
