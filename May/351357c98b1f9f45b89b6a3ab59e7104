The Queen has become the first-ever British Monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee - marking 70 years of service. To mark the historic milestone, Britons have been given an extended bank holiday weekend, running from June 2 - 5. More than 70,000 ‘Big Lunches’ and events have been planned across the country, with Brits already hanging up their bunting and stocking up on drinks for the four-day celebration. Big screens will be set up outdoors in major cities including London, Edinburgh and Cardiff - for the public to come together in honour of the monarch’s achievements. “In less than a month we will come together as a nation and Commonwealth to mark Her Majesty The Queen’s 70-year reign,” Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said. “No other British monarch has reached this milestone and we will celebrate it with tradition, pomp and circumstance”. The politician added: “I hope that people and communities across the country will come together to pay tribute to Her Majesty - whether that be to watch on big screens or toasting Her Majesty at a Big Jubilee Lunch with their neighbours or coming together in their local village hall”.
