Novice designers Lulu Urquhart and Adam Hunt took the honours for their celebration of the growing movement to restore and protect natural spaces. Its centrepiece was a beavers’ dam, complete with sticks pre-gnawed by the furry mammals.  The duo also used reclaimed timber, native British plants and West Country stone, but few traditional blooms. However, James Alexander-Sinclair, the Royal Horticultural Society chair of judges, said: “All the judges were captivated by the skill, endeavour and charm of A Rewilding Britain Landscape – every step is exquisite.”  The Daily Express Green Britain Needs You campaign has supported rewilding the UK. And the offering from Lulu and Adam is located on Main Avenue at the stellar West London horticultural show. It returned to its usual spring slot for the first time in three years after an autumn event last year. The RHS Chelsea Flower Show is on until Saturday.

Some criticised the winning garden and its beaver dam as looking downtrodden, jumbled, and a bit, well, messy. But that’s where nature is at its best.  Beavers are brilliant at creating wetland landscapes that store water and reduce the risk of flooding. As well as helping insects, birds and bees, wilder areas store carbon. Nature is our biggest ally in tackling climate change, but we need to give it a helping hand for it to help us. Joan Edwards is the Head of Living Seas, The Wildlife Trusts
