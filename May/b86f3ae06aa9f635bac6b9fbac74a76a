Google Chrome rival Mozilla Firefox is celebrating a landmark occasion this week. The veteran web browser, which first released in 2004, has hit the 100 updates mark, with a century of patches being reached on Tuesday May 5. And for this landmark update, Mozilla has released plenty of new features for both mobile and desktop, with the highlight arguably being subtitles for Firefox's picture-in-picture mode. This handy new feature will initially be available on Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video with Mozilla planning on rolling subtitles out for more sites in the future. Besides this headline feature, the 100th version of Firefox will also add some brand new wallpapers to help users jazz up their browser. To change the wallpapers, simply head to the settings section of your Firefox app.  Elsewhere, the latest update from Mozilla will also add a new HTTPS-only mode, which ensures you only visit secure websites that support the HTTPS security protocol, and the patch also adds a new feature that will make your browser look more tidier - clutter-free history section and clutter-free tabs. And finally, Firefox is also adding a language switcher feature that makes it easier for people to use their preferred language.  Speaking about its journey to the 100th Firefox patch, Mozilla said: "In 2004, we announced the release of Firefox 1.0 with a crowdfunded New York Times ad, which listed the names of every single person who contributed to building that first release â€” hundreds of people. Our goal with Firefox 1.0 was to provide a robust, user-friendly and trustworthy web experience. "We received praise for our features that helped users avoid pop-ups, increased online fraud protection, made tabbed browsing more efficient and gave people the ability to customize their browser with add-ons. Our goal was to put our users first and personalize their web experience and that goal still holds true today."
