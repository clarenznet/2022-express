Pensioners who rely on the state pension may be one of the worst hit groups by the cost of living crisis. Yet benefits which could provide support like Attendance Allowance are significantly under claimed. More than two million pensioners are living in poverty due to the cost of living crisis according to Age UK, but many could be due extra financial support from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Some 3.4 million pensioners are estimated to be eligible for Attendance Allowance worth £4,000 a year yet aren’t claiming it. This DWP benefit is available to pensioners who have an illness or disability that affects their everyday lives. However, they don’t need to have a full time carer to qualify.

Medical conditions like arthritis, heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease could mean someone qualifies for Attendance Allowance. The disability benefit is not means-tested, so people who are working can still claim. Unlike Personal Independence Payments (PIP), people will only need to attend an assessment if it’s unclear how their illness or disability affects them.

Pensioners should receive £61.85 if they need help during the day or at night. However, if someone needs help during both the day and night they could receive £92.40. Applicants might also qualify for Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or a Council Tax Reduction when they receive Attendance Allowance. Meanwhile, care home residents won’t usually be entitled to Attendance Allowance because their care is paid for by their local authority. However, it’s important to differentiate that they’ll still be able to claim Attendance Allowance if they pay for all their own care home costs. Anyone who thinks they may qualify can apply by post or phone at Gov.uk or 0800 731 0122. They can also ask for help filling out the forms from Citizen’s Advice, Age UK or Macmillan Cancer Support.
