Attendance Allowance is paid to Britons who have reached state pension age who need help because of a physical or mental disability. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates a staggering 3.4 million pensioners are not claiming this benefit, even though they would qualify. Medical conditions like arthritis, heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease could mean someone qualifies for Attendance Allowance worth £4,428 a year. This disability benefit is not means-tested, so people who are working can still claim. Although they will have to provide supporting evidence of their condition, people shouldn’t need an assessment like they are for Personal Independence Payments (PIP). Britons need to have reached the state pension age of 66 years old to qualify for this DWP benefit. READ MORE: Mum 'in tears' as she's unable to access £10,500 How much is Attendance Allowance? Not everyone receives the full amount of Attendance Allowance as it depends on how much their condition affects them. Pensioners should receive £61.85 if they need help during the day or at night. However, if someone needs help during both the day and night they could receive £92.40 a week.

Attendance Allowance also acts as a gateway benefit to Housing Benefit or a Council Tax Reduction which could make a significant difference to someone’s finances. However, some people have told Express.co.uk how they are put off by the paperwork and form filling involved. Anyone who struggles can ask for help from Citizen’s Advice or Macmillan Cancer support. David Samson, Welfare Benefit Specialist at poverty charity Turn2us, said unclaimed benefits are a huge problem. He explained: “Whether it is because of an overly complicated system, societal stigma or simply not knowing, there are many reasons why people miss out on their benefits. “People over the age of 65 are especially likely to be missing out on their entitlements. “We urge anyone who is unsure of what they are entitled to, to do a benefit calculation to see if there is anything they can claim.”  What is happening where you live?
