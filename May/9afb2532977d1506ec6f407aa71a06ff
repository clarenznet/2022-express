Actress Lina Esco had been in SWAT from season one which made its debut in November 2017. This time around, it wasn't a decision made by the show's creators to have Chris leave but rather a choice made by the actress herself. Esco told the producers about her intentions to leave SWAT around one year prior to her onscreen departure. Explaining the reason for her leaving SWAT, Esco states that it was down to her wanting to work on other projects. While Chris has left SWAT to start afresh, the show must and will go on. CBS confirmed that the drama had been renewed for a sixth season in April 2022. So far, there has been no talk of a confirmed release date. SWAT is available to watch on CBS in America and Sky One in the UK.
