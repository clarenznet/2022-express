Research carried out by a leasing comparison website LeaseLoco has shown that the number of British boy races is decreasing. The data also revealed that the number of young male drivers with penalty points on their driving licences has almost halved in the last 10 years. There has been a 41 percent fall in male drivers aged 17-21 with penalty points compared to 2012. The latest data collected by the DVLA showed that 41,085 male drivers aged between 17 and 21 have at least three points on their licences. In 2012, the figure was 72,569. That’s a drop of 43.4 percent in a decade.

This once again marks a drop of 41.2 percent in 10 years. Just before Covid struck in March 2020, there were 42,664 male drivers aged 17-21 with points on their licences, 41 percent down on 2012 numbers. Experts, however, suggested that the Covid pandemic might have slightly affected the figures with many motorists being unable to drive.

In 2012, the number was well over three million (3,388,038). The drop in motoring offences is more significant amongst female drivers. The number of female drivers with points on their licences topped one million (1,042,465) in 2012, compared to a little over 750,000 today (764,924). This correlates to a 26.7 percent decline in 10 years. Amongst male drivers, the number of motorists with penalty points has dropped 19.3 percent from 2,345,623 to 1,891,818. In 2012, drivers in their 40s committed the most motoring offences. Over half a million drivers in their 40s were penalised with points on their licences in 2012. According to the latest DVLA data, more drivers in their 50s have points on their licences than any other age group. John Wilmot, CEO of LeaseLoco, comments: “A combination of fewer people learning to drive, more speed cameras on UK roads deterring drivers from speeding and the likely pandemic effect, has seen fewer motoring offences. "And with the rising cost of motoring putting younger people off from learning to drive, we could see the number of younger motorists with penalty points continuing to fall. "Whether, as a nation, we have become better and safer drivers, is debatable. “If we look at the generational data, 50-something drivers have more penalty points on their licences than any other age group. “Ten years ago, the 40s age bracket had more penalty points, which suggests as this generation has aged many haven’t improved their driving habits.” The experts also suggested that drivers over the age of 40 have not improved their driving habits over the last decade. This is because the data revealed that 50-year-old male drivers in the UK have more penalty points on their licences than any other age demographic.
