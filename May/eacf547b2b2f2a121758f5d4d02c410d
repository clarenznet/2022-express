"UK Government approval will be required for the proceeds to be transferred from the frozen UK bank account. "In addition, the proposed new owners will commit £1.75bn in further investment for the benefit of the Club.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Boehly's group, who is the part owner of Los Angeles Dodgers, has acquired the club for £4 billion, making it a record sale for a professional sports team. The Boehly led group acquired the club from the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich who bought Chelsea in 2003. Mr Abramovich was forced to relinquish his ownership of the club following the sanctions imposed by the British Government following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  MORE FOLLOWS
