Lady Victoria Hervey, 45, put on a rather risqu√© display as she posed in a pink see-through gown on the red carpet. The encrusted pale pink gown looked amazing as the model glided down the red carpet. Illuminating her trim figure, the encrusted detailing faded away, exposing the sheer element of the dress, as well as the socialite's toned pins. Drawing in her petite waist, she styled the gown with a thin pink buckled belt, before turning around to flash her pert derriere to the cameras in the bottom-baring look. The gown featured an incredibly low neckline, with the socialite's modesty covered by light pink mesh. The arms of the dress looked radiant as they met with the sweeping gown while Lady Victoria posed in the French city. She wore her signature blonde locks in voluminous waves, while highlighting her youthful complexion with radiant makeup and a pink lip. Lady Victoria wore high strappy silver stilettos, matching her droopy silver earrings. She accessorised with a silver and red clutch as she smiled for the joyous occasion. After Cannes was entirely cancelled in 2020 and held under strict health protocols in 2021, the red carpet returned in all its glamour last night.
