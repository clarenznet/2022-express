This half-term period is the busiest travel period since before the pandemic with many passengers heading away for the Jubilee weekend. Passengers have faced chaotic scenes at Gatwick airport as well as at Manchester and Bristol airports. Passengers whose flights are cancelled are entitled to new flights on the original day of departure if possible. This is the case even if the only seats available are on a rival airline. Passengers who had their flight cancelled on short notice are entitled to cash compensation if the airline was responsible. easyJet will remove a row of seating from its planes which will allow its flights to operate with fewer members of the cabin crew. Many of the issues are caused by staff shortages in crucial areas such as cabin crew and airport security. Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, told Express.co.uk: "I'm afraid that some of these issues will continue into July as it's taking a long time for airports and airlines to recruity the required number of people. "Shortages of staff are creating bottlenecks in security channels at airports as well as leading to flight cancellations due to lack of flight crew. "Slow Government processing of mandatory security passes, for new starters, is adding to the delays in getting enough resources in the right areas. All of this is compounded by there simply being fewer people available to recruit. "There has been a shrinking of the workforce, either put off by wages being too low or attracted by higher-paying jobs in Europe, giving people no incentive to come to the UK."
