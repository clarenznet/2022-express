One MP is found guilty of groping a child, another watches hardcore porn in the Commons chamber, women (usually juniors) are routinely touched-up, slavvered over and pinned against walls by older men, MPs are too drunk to stand, paralytic staff vomit all over the Commons bar, and astonishingly almost 10 percent of our betters, our leaders, those who would seek to govern us are now alleged to be sexual miscreants or hideous bullies. Bad people then. Are 10 percent of the people you work with facing disciplinary action for sexual deviancy or bullying? Thought not. Yet in Westminster, where moral authority is not just required but vital, we're served up a smorgasbord of grubbiness on a daily basis, from the leaders downwards. And yes I know there are many decent, honourable MPs - but not enough. The number of decent, honourable MPs in Parliament needs to be 650. And it is far, far from this. Look, if you're a woman walking down the street and there's MP on one side and a hoodie on the other - take your chances with the hoodie, you're statistically much less likely to be facing a sexual deviant or a bully. (Depressingly I recently drew the same statistical conclusion with Metropolitan Police officers.) Makes Partygate rule-breaking and subsequent lies on both sides of the House about their booze-quaffing party leaders look rather quaint doesn't it? Lies from our MPs we have become inured to, indeed we've rather come to expect them. (And this in itself should be a bit of a red flag - every time you drop the moral bar it gets easier to do it next time.) But thankfully we are not quite at the stage where sexually deviancy among the honourable members is accepted with the same rueful shrug as a politician lying One female MP told me: "The idea of watching pornography in the Chamber in Parliament just beggars belief. It made me feel physically sick. "I found the whole thing deeply upsetting. I was truly shocked that one of my own colleagues could have behaved in such a disgusting way." The fact she was shocked is, as I say, encouraging, but that she was surprised might suggest she really hasn't been paying attention. Now of course Neil Parish, the tractor porn watching Tory member for Tiverton and Honiton, Parish is now resigning as an MP after admitting he had twice watched online filth in the House of Commons. Parish, 65, a former farmer initially claimed he had been looking at tractors on his phone before straying onto a website with a "very similar name". I assumed "tractoring" was some esoteric sexual practice I was unaware of so, seeker after truth that I am, I Googled. It's not. The best Google could offer was: "Verb, meaning to play with a running tractor with at least one attachment." (Although I fear I may have just unwittingly invented a new agriculture-based kink).   For my money another extremely experienced female MP hit the nail squarely on the head when she told me: "To be honest I always thought Neil Parish was a bit weird - but that's the problem, the whole place is full of weirdos really. "The thing is it's filled with people who think they are very important - it's filled with big male egos, and yes people who in other jobs would be considered weirdos. And I'm afraid a lot of it is based in the public school background thing. "The old school tie thing, and the rank sexism that goes with it, that still very much persists." And this rang true. But another somewhat defeated Labour MP added: “Misogyny and sexism and sexual harassment are so embedded in the culture of the place, it’s difficult to see how it changes.” And that didn't. Really? Is it really that difficult for MPs to stop being predatory, woman-bothering scumbags? It happened to me in the workplace a few years ago. Came to my attention that a female reporter was apparently receiving unwanted advances from a male colleague. Did I order a lengthy, dithering inquiry? Nope, I took him into an office and gave him some 140 decibel advice telling him "this is a place of work not a f*cking dating agency!" and that if he even so much as looked at a female employee his feet wouldn't touch. To be honest I never knew the precise details, but then I didn't need to - the advice was, and is, applicable to all male employees, always, everywhere. He remains I might add, an excellent reporter. Just a more respectful one. Is a basic level of respect really too much to ask of our MPs?
