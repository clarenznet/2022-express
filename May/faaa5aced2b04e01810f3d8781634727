Speculation about Putin’s health and state of mind has spiked since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Multiple sources have suggested that Putin has cancer and other illnesses, such as Parkinson’s disease or even schizophrenia. But director and producer Oliver Stone has spoken with the Kremlin leader himself multiple times in the past, and he claims that Putin admitted his condition. Mr Stone interviewed Putin for two years between 2015 and 2017 and again in 2019 for his documentary 'The Putin Interviews'. In an interview with Lex Fridman Podcast, the filmmaker noted that Putin had had cancer and he is now cured. He said: "Remember this, Putin has had cancer and I think he's overcome it.

Stone conducted more than a dozen interviews with Putin over two years for 'The Putin Interviews', a four-part documentary released in 2017. He then met with the Russian leader again in the Kremlin in June 2019. During one of the interviews for the documentary, Putin revealed that he was a grandfather, a rare public comment on his personal life.

He added that Putin seemed "not well informed" and suggested he had overestimated "the degree of cooperation" Russian forces would receive from ethnic Russians in Ukraine. The filmmaker said he was only speculating, but added that he believed Putin "did not assess the situation correctly". The director, who has been highly critical of US foreign policy, said there was "a wall of propaganda like I've seen in the West, including France and Britain" about invading Ukraine.
