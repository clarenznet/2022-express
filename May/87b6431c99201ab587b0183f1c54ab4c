Three years after her 1979 divorce from Jocelyn, Janie was asked by Princess Margaret to become her lady-in-waiting.The two women became lifelong friends. Speaking after the princess's death in 2002, Janie said that there was "never a dull moment" with the Queen's sister. Janie's son Rupert died of heart disease at the age of 24.
