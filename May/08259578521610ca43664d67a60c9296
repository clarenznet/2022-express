The mega EuroMillions jackpot of £164 million has not yet been won by anyone in Europe - and could continue to grow if it remains unclaimed on Friday May 6. Camelot’s Andy Carter said: “Friday’s jackpot is a wonderful amount of money and a winner could do so much good for their loved ones and the local community. “I have seen firsthand the difference that winners make transforming people’s lives around them. “My team and I have our fingers crossed for all UK players and are on standby to support all our big winners as they start their life-changing journey.” But if the jackpot isn’t won, it will continue to grow. The EuroMillions jackpot is capped when it reaches 230m euros (£195m). READ MORE: EuroMillions results LIVE: £145M jackpot this Tuesday - have you won? The winnings could reach this enormous amount on Friday, May 13, unless one lucky player bags it beforehand. If no one wins it then, it will remain at the cap for a further four draws. If there is still no claimers, there will be a rare EuroMillions Must Be Won draw. In this scenario, if no ticket matches all five main numbers and two lucky stars, the entire jackpot prize will roll down into the prize tier where there is at least one winner – most likely to be five main numbers and one lucky star. In 2021 there were five UK EuroMillions winners. These include anonymous winners who took home £122m and £111m in April and June respectively. The biggest winners who came forward about their win were Frances and Patrick Connolly from Northern Ireland, who scooped a £115m prize in 2019. The largest single win by a British player stands at £170 million - which was won by an anonymous ticket holder in October 2019. The winning main EuroMillions numbers were 08, 20, 26, 47, and 48. The lucky star numbers were 03 and 08. The Thunderball numbers were 01, 18, 20, 25, 26, while the Thunderball was 03. If you’re not lucky enough to bag the main jackpot, you can still win a range of other prizes. There are 13 different categories of prizes, ranging from just £2.50 to the full jackpot. Any ticket bought with EuroMillions will give you automatic entry into the UK Millionaire Maker - where one person is guaranteed to win £1 million. The Thunderball is held concurrently with the EuroMillions. For just £1 a play you could win a life-changing £500,000.
