The world's largest music competition is an annual celebration of Europe’s best music artists is being hosted in Turin, Italy following Måneskin’s win in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, last year. The competition began with thirty-five countries participating in the semi-finals on Tuesday, May 10, and Thursday, May 12. That number slowly whittled down to those who made it through in the first semi-final including Armenia, Greece, Iceland, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland and Ukraine. The qualifiers in the second semi-final were Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Sweden. They will join the Big Five — France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK — for the grand final this Saturday. The Big Five contribute the most to the European Broadcasting Union, so automatically qualify for the final each year, and along with the host nation and ten other countries, come together for the decisive sing-off. This year’s competition sees 25 countries compete to be crowned the winner. The lucky act’s chances are determined by combining two sets of results from each country, from a national jury and a public vote. Each participating country elects five music professionals to form a jury who rank all the songs – with points being distributed to the top ten acts. Public voting figures are also ranked and points awarded, and these are then put together and are given out during the final by a spokesperson in each country over video. Nearly 200 million viewers are expected to watch the Eurovision Song Contest this year. So what do YOU think? Who do you think should win Eurovision 2022?
