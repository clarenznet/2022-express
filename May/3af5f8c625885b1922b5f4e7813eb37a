Many tourists had visited the popular areas of Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol. The Canary Islands were also ranked as good value with 91 percent of Britons thinking they got a lot for their money there. Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria are some of the most popular islands with stunning beaches. Almost 90 percent of Britons also thought that Greece was good value with Turkey and Portugal close behind. Turkey is one of the few destinations where the pound sterling will go further than it did last year. Britons changing £500 can expect to receive around 50 percent more in Turkish lira, almost £167 for their pounds. Long-haul travellers ranked Mexico and Thailand as good value destinations with 85 percent thinking Mexico was good value. However, Britons will need to watch out for a rise in the value of the Mexican peso and will get around £70 less when they change £500. But where were the worst value destinations?  Just 42 percent of travellers thought Scandinavia was good value while only 44 percent thought Dubai was. Nick Boden, Head of Post Office Travel Money, said: “Sterling’s fall in value makes it even more important for people planning trips to consider the costs they will face in resorts abroad before they take the plunge and book a holiday. “While they weigh up the cost of flights and accommodation or package deals, they will need to watch what is happening with sterling as that will make a sizeable difference to the overall cost of their holiday. “By choosing destinations like Turkey or Bulgaria in Europe or Thailand or Mexico further afield, they could save themselves money.”
