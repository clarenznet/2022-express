PS4 and PS5 fans will be treated to a truckload of games joining the new and revamped PS Plus service. Next month the revamped PS Plus service will be launching which brings with it new membership tiers that offer a catalogue of hundreds of games to play - including modern hits and classic retro titles. And today (Monday May 16) the PS4 and PS5 makers have revealed some of the games that will be heading to the new PS Plus. Newer hits such as Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and the Demon's Souls Remake will be available with PS Plus as will classic retro games including Ape Escape, Tekken 2, Syphon Filter and Tokyo Jungle. In case you missed it, the new PS Plus will feature three membership tiers - Essential which offers the PS Plus we all know right now that offers online gaming, cloud saves and free monthly games as well as the Extra and Deluxe tiers. Extra offers a library of hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games as well as what's included with Essential, while Deluxe includes everything included in the Extra and Essential tiers as well as a library of hundreds of PS1, PS2, PSP and PS3 games as well as time-limited game trials. Interestingly, the new PlayStation Blog post also revealed that Assassin's Creed Valhalla is available with PS Plus "as part of Ubisoft+ Classics. Access to Ubisoft+ Classics games is a benefit for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members." Ubisoft later provided more details on this, as they revealed 27 games from its Ubisoft+ streaming service will be available as part of PS Plus, with this increasing to 50 by the end of this year. Besides Assassin's Creed Valhalla, other Ubisoft games that will be available with the new PS Plus include Watch Dogs, The Division and STEEP.
