Virgin Media is offering customers a great-sounding freebie or money off their bill. The TV and broadband firm has launched a flash sale that includes JBL smart speakers or up to £150 of credit that can be used to reduce those outgoings. Sound good?  These deals are on offer to customers who sign up for certain bundles which include the Big Bundle, Biggest TV Bundle or the Ultimate Volt Bundle. Those joining more entry-level options will get a JBL Flip 6 speaker (worth £130) which features a water-resistant design, 12-hour battery for music playback on the move and extra bass thanks to its 2-way audio set-up. If you opt for the more premium Virgin packages you'll get a JBL Beam 5.0 Soundbar instead. This speaker, which costs £349, features stunning Dolby Atmos and punchy bass without the need for a separate subwoofer. There's also full access to Amazon's Alexa personal assistant and you can beam songs and playlists to it from your iPhone via AirPlay. The offers are running until Thursday, May 5 so there's not long left if you fancy taking advantage. Here are all the bundles that feature the freebies, how much they cost and what is included.
