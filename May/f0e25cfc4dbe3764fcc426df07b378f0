Kirsty, 53, explained how, in 2017, she would wake up feeling like she had "glass in my joints". Constantly exhausted and in pain, she was finally diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary fibromyalgia in August 2018. She was told there was no cure but the condition could be managed with "a deep rest without stress". But she added: "I'm off most of my medications but that's four years, that's how long it's taken." And whether this week will mark her comeback, she said: "I'll see if I make a good enough job of it and what other people think."
