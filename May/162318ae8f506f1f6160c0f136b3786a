Video footage from the Louvre art gallery, where the Mona Lisa has been on display since 1797, shows the man launching cake at the portrait. The Mona Lisa itself was thankfully not damaged, due to its glass protection. One Twitter user who witnessed the event described it as “unreal”. They wrote: “It seems unreal to me, but a man dressed as an old lady got up from a wheelchair and tried to break the protective glass of the Mona Lisa. Footage later shows security guards washing the glass which protects the painting. One staff member takes the wheelchair away, which appears merely to have been used as a prop. The protester shouted: “Think of the Earth. There are people who are destroying the Earth. Think about it. Artists tell you: think about the Earth.” READ MORE: Rejected Russian student university row raises 'more questions' The Louvre does not want to comment on the matter, according to the AFP news agency.
