Strictly Come Dancing winners Giovanni Pernice and Rose Ayling-Ellis looked adorable as they took to the red carpet at the BAFTA TV Awards this afternoon. The duo, who won the latest series of the popular BBC dance show, grinned from ear to ear as they attended the event after being nominated for the Must See moment following their poignant and silent dance to Symphony. Rose stunned as she donned a floor-length black satin gown for the glitzy occasion. The sleeveless, high-necked garment hugged her incredible figure and featured a bow design at the back.
