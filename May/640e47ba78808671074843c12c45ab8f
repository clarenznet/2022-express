Three is giving away cashback worth up to £250 when people switch over from a rival network and sign up to get a Samsung Galaxy phone or iPhone. The amazing deal is available on a range of handsets, with cashback offered on handsets such as Apple's popular iPhone 13 range as well as Samsung's latest Galaxy S22 handset. Arguably the best Three deal can be found on the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G, which not only offers £250 worth of cashback but six months worth of access to Disney+ entirely for free. If you've never subscribed to the Netflix rival before, and want to catch up on hit exclusive shows such as Moon Knight and WandaVision then this is an ideal deal. Disney+ is usually priced at £7.99 per month so this deal offers an additional saving of almost £48. If you've already got a handset you're happy with you can alternatively turn to a SIM-only deal that Three is running which bundles in a pre-paid MasterCard with £100 entirely for free.  This £100 cashback is available with the Three Unlimited data SIM, and better yet the price of this plan has been slashed too. The SIM usually cost £22 a month but for the first six months this is half price with the monthly fee instead £11.
