  Wallis, 27, stunned in the detailed ensemble that saw her cut a memorable silhouette on the Cannes red carpet for the screening of Top Gun: Maverick. The star wore an asymmetrically-cut dress, which left her right shoulder bare. Her left shoulder was covered by a long black train that fell all the way to the floor. Similar black material hung from around her waist on the right hand side. The middle of the dress was separated by a black, diagonal piece of fabric, while the rest was covered by a translucent, mesh material. Below the unusual patterned meshing, the star’s bra and pants were clearly visible, while another daring thigh-high slit exposed her left leg. The actress’ accessories matched the garment’s asymmetrical style, as she wore a long drop down pearl earring on her right ear and a simple stud on her left. Wallis opted for sultry makeup, with a gentle smokey eye and shiny pink lipstick.
