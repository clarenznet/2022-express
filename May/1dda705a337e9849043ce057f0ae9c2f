Liverpool fan Conor Coady has explained how his Wolves team can do the Reds a huge favour by beating Manchester City on Wednesday night. Wolves welcome City to Molineux in a crucial match in the Premier League title race. Pep Guardiola's side currently sit top of the table, three points clear of Liverpool in second. Jurgen Klopp's team face Aston Villa 24 hours earlier, so could be level on points with City if they pick up a valuable victory at Villa Park. Wolves have had some success over City since their promotion back to the top flight in 2018. They have two wins and a draw from their seven league clashes in that time, with City winning just once at Molineux. Coady is a boyhood Liverpool supporter and came through the academy at Anfield, making two senior appearances before leaving in 2014. The Wolves skipper has outlined the importance of staying in the match against City for as long as possible, knowing his side will not see much of the ball.

Being compact, being together and staying in the game as long as possible. "I think a lot of teams other than the top two will probably tell you the same thing because they're so hard to come up against, it's so hard to get the ball off them at times. Listen, you want to go into every game and try and keep the ball and have as much possession as you can. "But I think we understand the situation when you're going up against two of the best teams in the world and sometimes you may have to play a little bit of a different way. You have to be resilient, you have to be determined, you have to stay in it, be compact and defend properly.
