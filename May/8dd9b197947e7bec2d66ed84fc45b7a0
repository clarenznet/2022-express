Jeff and Davinia Pritchard stepped in with their chequebook when daughter Claire was struggling to conceive. She weighed more than 20st at the time, so her mum and dad paid for her to have private gastric surgery. It kickstarted her fertility and she is now mum to Lillie, two, and 11-month-old son Emrys. Davinia, 56, said: "Of everything we've done with our lottery winnings, our two little grandchildren are far and away the best. "When we won we wanted to spread the joy to our family and that's what we've done." Mum-of-three Davinia and Claire, 39, both had £5,000 gastric sleeve operations after they struggled to lose weight through dieting. They went into the same hospital on the same day and were operated on by the same surgeon. Davinia said: "It was the best money we've ever spent." Claire lost an incredible 10st and became pregnant soon afterwards. She and her retail worker husband Jonathan, 49, went through the heartbreak of a miscarriage before Claire conceived again. She said: "We announced it on Mother's Day. We took Mum and Dad out for a surprise meal and I put the baby scan picture in the mother's day card. There were a lot of tears." Lillie was born in November 2019 and Emrys in 2021. Claire said: "It's perfect - we had given up on having children and now we have two. We would never have had them if Mum and Dad hadn't won the lottery." Davinia and Jeff, 58, from Carmarthen, west Wales, still live in the converted farmhouse they had before their win seven years ago. They struck lucky on the Lotto Millionaire Raffle, which is no longer available. Jeff quit his job as a works manager with a construction firm and is now one of the leading bee experts and honey producers in Wales. The couple, who have five other grandchildren, took their entire family to Disney, Florida, and Davinia splashed out on her dream car, an Audi Q5 in champagne gold. Andy Carter, a National Lottery winners' adviser, said: "Their win has been both life-changing and life-giving."
