After years of partnering up on the FIFA video game series, EA Sports and world footballing organisation FIFA recently confirmed plans to split after the release of FIFA 23. Both companies will move on without each other after this year's release, with EA Sports FC taking over from the FIFA series. With the surprise news still fresh in the minds of fans, now seems like a good time to rank all of the games in the long-running franchise. Using data gathered from IMDB, the folks over at Odds-Comparison.com have put together a list of the best and worst rated games in the FIFA franchise. According to the user ratings, FIFA 13 is the highest rated game in the entire series, having racked up a score of 8.1/10. FIFA 13 is followed by FIFA 12 and FIFA 14 in joint second, while FIFA 11 takes the third spot. This era of FIFA ushered in many of the popular game mechanics and online modes that remain to this day. Unfortunately, however, things have started to go downhill in recent years, with FIFA 21 and FIFA 22 occupying the bottom two spots on the list. The earlier games in the series also fall short in the rankings, with the first game listed at number 15, behind both FIFA 95 and FIFA 96. The full list can be seen below...
