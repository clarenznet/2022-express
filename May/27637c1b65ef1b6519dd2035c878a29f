Major health risks cutting many people’s lives short include heart disease, cancer, stroke and high cholesterol. Could certain foods consumed daily help to cut those risks drastically and even promote longevity? For longevity and health, experts recommend upping your intake of healthy fats such as olive oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts and seeds. Healthy fats have a host of health benefits for the body. They have been found to lower levels of bad cholesterol and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Antioxidants are another substance promoting healthy ageing by preventing oxidation. Oxidation can produce free radicals, which then may damage the body's cells. Antioxidants are found in fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. They neutralise free radicals thereby reducing oxidative stress. “In laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development,” said Cancer.gov. Foods rich in antioxidants include: Adding more fibre to your diet is also key when it comes to longevity. Fibre is made up of the indigestible parts or compounds of plants, which pass relatively unchanged through our stomach and intestines. The main role of fibre is to keep the digestive system healthy. Ensuring you are getting enough fibre from vegetables, and reducing the amounts of processed and high sugar foods in your diet will ensure all round health. Dietary sources of fibre include beans, whole grains, carrots and broccoli, among others. Avoiding high sugar foods such as sweetened drinks, white bread, sweets, cakes and cereals will positively impact your longevity.
