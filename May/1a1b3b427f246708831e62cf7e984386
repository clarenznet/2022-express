Danni Menzies has sparked a frenzy on Instagram after sharing incredible snaps of her figure in a bikini as she enjoys time in the sun in Mykonos, Greece. It comes after the A Place In The Sun host, 33, announced that she's stopped filming scenes for the Channel 4 show, but her social media pages have shown little sign of the property expert slowing down on the jet-setting front. The Edinburgh-born beauty has previously spoken of her passion for exploring the Greek Islands - and today she seems to have been doing exactly that. Tagging the fitness travel brand Helios Retreats, she posted a leggy snap of herself reclining by the sea, along with the hashtag, "#mykonos." "Looks like I’m gonna join the 100 club today," she exclaimed in reference to her follower count reaching the 100,000 mark. "Noooooooo idea why you’re here but thanks!" Danni added. In the photo, she showcased one of her most glamorous beach-side poses, stretching out her limbs and turning her head to the direction of the ocean. She wore a turquoise bikini almost exactly the same hue of the sky. "Side note: this pic is why we all need a [yoga tutor] telling us how to pose," she wrote in her Instagram caption before tagging @tamarayasinyoga. Danni's luxury wellness getaway at the Mykonos villa will offer her the opportunity to take part in hikes, discover sunset panoramas and sample nutritious, detox-orientated meals.
