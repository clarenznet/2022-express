Official figures show that last year in Stafford 866 days passed on average between the offence being reported and the case being completed. Nearly half of Crown courts recorded waits of more than a year. On average across England and Wales in 2021, 352 days passed – up from 186 in 2019. A quarter of all courts saw delays more than double between 2019 and 2021. Labour Shadow Justice Secretary Steve Reed, who obtained the figures, said: “The Conservatives are letting criminals off and letting victims down through the record delays they’ve created in the courts. "This high-on-tax, soft-on-crime Conservative [Government] is not serious about tackling robbery and this data shows that their incompetence is prolonging victims’ trauma. “Labour will start to clear the court backlog and establish the Victims' Code in law and ensure victims their rights in the legal system.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Increased wait times are the result of the pandemic but our half-a-billion-pounds plan to restore and speed up the justice system is working. The Crown Court backlog is falling, almost a fifth more offenders were convicted last year and we are delivering a Victims’ Law to help them get the swift justice they deserve.”
