Bacteria are microscopic infectious agents that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The inhalation of some microbes, namely Legionella bacteria, has been implicated as a transmission mode for potentially deadly pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 10 people who contract the disease die due to their illness. Legionella bacteria, which causes the potentially deadly Legionnaires’ disease, typically builds up in a shower or water outlet that isn’t used regularly.The bacteria specialises in infecting human immune cells, such as macrophages, which are in charge of eradicating foreign invaders.When people turn on the shower or tap, water droplets contaminated with Legionella bacteria spread via the spray that is produced in small droplets known as aerosols, according to the water specialist treatment company WCS.“People breathe these aerosols into the lungs via aspiration as they are small enough to inhale," explains the company. “The lungs then become infected with Legionella bacteria, and the person catches Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever."Some people contract develop Legionnaires disease after drinking contaminated water, with those who suffer from swallowing difficulties at greater risk of infection.The government’s Health and Safety Executive website states: "Legionnaires’ disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia and everyone is susceptive to infection.”Those who are particularly vulnerable to severe inflammation of the lungs, however, include smokers, heavy drinkers, people who suffer from chronic respiratory disease, diabetics and anyone over the age of 45.

Almost half of the patients with the disorder develop an ailment relating to the nervous system, such as confusion, delirium, depression, disorientation, and hallucinations.Symptoms tend to merge within two to 10 after the infection, adds the website. In 2017, researchers warned a combination of rusty water and stainless steel taps could put people at risk of a life-threatening disease.Scientists rang the alarm after discovering the protective coating on the fixtures, degraded over time and encouraged the growth of the deadly bacteria.The findings emerged during an experiment conducted by Wilco van der Lugt, a safety engineer who contributed to European guidelines on preventing the bacteria. The expert and his team experimented with three kinds of taps commonly found in households and found when rust mixed with Legionella in the stainless steel tap, half of the samples ended up infected.It had previously been established that rust particles which can come from iron pipes encourage the growth of Legionella bacteria.This is usually because the water in the system has remained stagnant for too long, allowing the bacteria to fester.The WCS Group recommends keeping the showerhead clean to prevent infections and conducting regular inspections.
