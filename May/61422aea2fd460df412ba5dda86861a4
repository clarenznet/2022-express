Police have reportedly cordoned off a road in West Bromwich, West Midlands, and deployed dog units after discovering a package. According to Birmingham Live, a small object which is described as "yellowish" in colour, was seen on the pavement within the cordon. It has since been identified as "not suspicious". A witness said crowds had gathered on the street. Wetherspoon pub The Billiard Hall, which sits within the cordon, declined to comment on the investigation. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: "We were called to Victoria Street, West Bromwich at around 9.30am today after an unattended package was discovered. "The area has been sealed off as a precaution and the Army’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team have been asked to attend." It later added: "The item is not believed to be suspicious and has been handed to Sandwell Council. "The road has now re-opened."  Traffic was stopped in the city centre but roads have since reopened. The pub was purpose-built as a snooker and billiard hall, but has its original façade retained. In its heyday, it had 23 full-size snooker tables available.
