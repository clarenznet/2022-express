 Kim Kardashian, 41, attended the Met Gala 2022 with her boyfriend Pete Davidson, 28. The couple started dating in October 2021. The reality star stole the show as she borrowed the iconic dress Marilyn Monroe wore in 1962 when she sang Happy Birthday to President John F. Kennedy. Pete wore a black suit with a white shirt and black tie. He accessorised with black sunglasses. The beaded dress is one of the most expensive dresses in the world and was sold at an auction for $4.8 million in 2016. Kim dyed her hair blonde for the full bombshell effect. It is thought that the dress was so tight, Marilyn originally had to be sewn into it for her performance for the President.
