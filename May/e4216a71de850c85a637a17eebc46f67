Journalist Camilla Tominey highlighted how the occasion is the first time the Duchess of Sussex has joined Prince Harry to step out in public in the UK since Megxit. The royal expert said "brave faces will be put on proceedings" amid the rift with Prince Charles and the Cambridges. The Telegraph's associate editor said: "As was the case with Prince Philip's funeral, brave faces will be put on proceedings. "The most interesting addition to the proceedings of course is Meghan because previously we've seen Harry by himself in the UK and now the Duchess is going to come back into the fold. "Obviously the body language and reading of it going to be quite fascinating. "A successful visit as far as the Royal Family is concerned is everyone smiling and looking like they're having a great time and the Queen being front and centre of all of the proceedings."
