The creeping and disproportionate hikes in the cost of staple products such as pasta, rice, chicken and mixed frozen vegetables have been stealthily wounding the wallets of those struggling at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis for quite some time. But it may come as a shock to those who have the power to do something to alleviate the struggle - where MPs and large corporations have been content to ignore the concerns of their constituents, campaigners and charities on the frontline patching up the bedraggled ruins of what used to be a semi-decent welfare system, the Office Of National Statistics are a formidable ally in the fight for impoverished voices to be heard. And one that the Government can’t afford to ignore. The Chancellor's latest plan to give the majority of people in the UK a grant to assist with energy costs is a welcome intervention, but it won’t quite catch everyone who is falling through the cracks. Many people won’t qualify for it, so won’t receive the much needed help, and Sunak is yet to acknowledge that he is even aware of their existence, let alone put measures in place to assist. And let’s be clear - one-off cash injections are helpful in the immediate term, to put food on the table for a couple of weeks or keep a bailiff from the door, but the Treasury needs to think longer term. The cost of living crisis has been 12 years in the making; 12 years of Conservative led austerity cuts to support services and social care, 12 years of rapidly escalating foodbank use, Universal Credit delays, the rate at which benefits are set being grossly underestimated - and this data from the ONS will make it harder for the Government to argue that their measures are fair and proportionate. From the early days of the Cameron-Clegg-Osborne Government - all of whom have retreated into lucrative private life leaving the wreckage of a million hungry citizens at their abruptly turned backs - we have been force-fed the lie that ‘we are all in it together’. As suspected for quite some time, we may well all be in a cost of living crisis at the moment, but some of us are in it far more painfully - and indeed fatally - than others.
