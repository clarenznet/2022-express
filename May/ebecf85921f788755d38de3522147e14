  David took to Instagram today to give his 72.7 million followers an insight into his elaborate birthday celebrations. He captioned the post: “Thank you to my beautiful family for the perfect weekend. “Dad Missed you @brooklynpeltzbeckham and @romeobeckham,” he added with heart emojis. “Love you all,” he wrote, tagging Victoria, Brooklyn and Romeo, as well as their younger children Cruz, 17, and daughter Harper, 10.  The post featured a video of David with his son Cruz singing and dancing along to Michael Jackson’s Rock With You. Next up was a stunning picture of Spice Girl Victoria, who posed seductively in a semi-translucent black evening gown. He also shared an adorable photo with daughter Harper dressed in a pink pig onesie. The rest of the snaps showed David enjoying himself at the river and posing with a number of other close family members.
