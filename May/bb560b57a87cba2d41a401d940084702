The 77-year-old actor sported a classic look as he unveiled his ageless appearance as he took his place by his son's side on graduation day. "One proud Dad!" he exclaimed publicly in praise of the 21-year-old, who he shares with glamorous actress wife Catherine Zeta Jones. Taking to Instagram yesterday, he penned: "Congratulations Dylan!" he continued, inserting a clap emoji into his caption, before adding: "Well done!" The stars' son has graduated from the prestigious Ivy League school, Brown University. Both he and Catherine have described themselves as "inexplicably proud" as Dylan graduated with a degree in political science. Michael opted for a smart casual outfit as he posed for photos with his son. He donned a pair of beige trousers and matched them with a pale blue shirt and loosely fitted navy blue jacket. His long tresses was swept into a back-combed style. Meanwhile, Dylan smiled alongside his father, placing an arm around him as he stood proudly in his graduation hat. "You must be so proud of him. Great School too," commented @pilotsmom2002. @tpeacock711 chimed in: "Way cool congratulations!!!" @officialjamesp_lay added: "Wow that's so wonderful! I truly appreciate your sense of integrity and character that you have instilled in your children."
