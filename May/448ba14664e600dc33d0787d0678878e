Max Verstappen produced a near-perfect showing to win Sunday's inaugural Miami Grand Prix ahead of pole-sitter Charles Leclerc. The Dutchman passed his Ferrari rival during the early stages of the contest and never looked back despite a late safety car period to clinch his third victory of the new campaign in some style. Verstappen managed to pull clear of Leclerc without too much difficulty and was running 7.5 seconds clear of the Monegasque driver before Lando Norris crashed out after tangling with Pierre Gasly to bring out the safety car. The lead did not change hands as a result of the late interruption, though, with Leclerc failing to regain his advantage in spite of his best efforts before the end of the 57-lap race. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton was beaten by George Russell yet again despite qualifying six places ahead of the 24-year-old on Saturday. The seven-time Drivers' Championship winner was eventually overtaken by his Mercedes team-mate, who reaped the rewards of the safety car period after a long first stint on hard tyres, during the closing stages of the contest at the sun-soaked Miami International Autodrome.
