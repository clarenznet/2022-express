Kristen Stewart and Léa Seydoux attended the 75th Cannes Film Festival together to mark their new movie Crimes Of The Future. Kristen, 32, boasted a completely braless look, flaunting her incredible physique in nothing but an eye-catching Chanel suit. Her red and white striped tweed suit risked a red carpet wardrobe malfunction, as it hung loosely open at the front, with all the buttons but one left undone. She positioned a black and white CC brooch on the left pocket to showcase the brand, while her co-star, Daniel Craig's former Bond girl Léa, wore a chic black suit and pale pink floral tie. Lea might have sported an androgynous look for that photo session, pairing the suit with a crisp white shirt and wearing her hair in a short bob, but later that day, she returned to her Bond girl roots in a sensational patent leather dress. The top section of her gown featured a vinyl effect, while the lower portion was designed with a dramatic split up the thigh. The pair both looked delighted to be back after a two year absence from the festival owing to the pandemic. As the cameras snapped away beside them, the actresses were all smiles at the glamorous event.
