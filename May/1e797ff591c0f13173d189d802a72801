The motor company commissioned Simon to compile the list of stand-out songs after conducting a survey of 2,000 UK drivers about their attitudes to in-car entertainment. Rebecca Adamson, head of automobile said: “Since we launched the Honda Civic, the analogue radios and tape decks may have evolved into touch screens, but the principle remains the same. There are few better pairings than a road trip with a brilliant playlist.” A quarter of people have built their own motoring playlist, and almost half of respondents said they experience a lift in mood when they listen to music in the car (48 percent), with four in 10 saying they feel more relaxed at the wheel. Nearly a quarter (24 percent) said they feel more focused with music on in the car, and 22 percent said they found playing tunes made them feel more energised when driving. Simon’s choices mirror the musical journey since the first Honda Civic hit the roads. Since its launch in 1972, more than 27.5 million Civics have been sold across 170 countries. He chose Alice Cooper’s "School’s Out" for the car’s launch year, moving through the decades to include top hits from Oasis with "Wonderwall" as well as contemporary smashes from Calvin Harris, Rag’n’Bone Man and The Weeknd. Simon – who also celebrated his own 50th birthday this month – said: “I think first and foremost, a perfect driving track makes you, the car and the road one. “It makes the traffic go away and complements the driving experience, when that song plays, it draws you in, and for that moment, it's the ultimate connection you, your car and music. “Driving for me is one of the most personal spaces, and the driving environment can really influence our mood. A great driving song helps to mentally prepare you for the journey ahead, and to savour a moment.” The power of music and tailoring your soundtrack is rooted in science, as confirmed by cognitive neuroscientist, Dr Diana Omigie. Dr Omigie said: “Research shows that being able to listen to favourite artists, and being able to listen to music in general, may increase the perception of situational control and in turn extend music’s effect on stress reduction. “Previous studies into how individually selected music can induce and maintain positive moods during a simulated driving experiment have produced interesting results. Subjective mood ratings have showed that music can successfully maintain a positive mood in high traffic density and during the negotiation of narrow lanes.” Indeed, 42 percent of Brits say they tailor their driving playlist to the type of road they’re on. When asked about curating driving songs, nostalgia emerged among the top requirements for a strong playlist, as 48 percent of those surveyed said that they include tracks which evoke memories. A good variety of songs (70 percent) and enough tracks for a long journey (56 percent) made up some of the top asks. The radio remains one of the most popular devices in the car for 80 percent of British motorists, while a surprising 35 percent of those surveyed said they still listen to CDs, and for one in 10 the retro appeal of a cassette deck endures. The research, conducted via OnePoll, showed a third of motorists use streaming to listen to their favourite media, while aux and USB inputs are used by 24 percent. Rebecca Adamson said: “In a time where we’re surrounded by noise, hitting the open road with your favourite tracks playing, or hearing a new song for the first time on the radio is a timeless luxury. “With the all-new Honda Civic e:HEV which is launching later this year, careful attention has been paid to the hybrid drivetrain and noise management to create a refined cabin. “As people prepare for their bank holiday travels, we wanted to share some of our top tracks, as compiled by Simon. Of course, it’s a personal choice and everyone will have their own favourites.” A previous survey of parent drivers by Honda revealed that 2,496 songs are played every year in the typical family car.  The automobile company also did a poll of its own audience, who nominated songs to be added to the list.
