The Duke of Sussex is to play a full summer season in Santa Barbara, California, for the Los Padres team. They have a tournament from June 3 to 19, suggesting he will not return for the double bank holiday weekend from June 2 to 5. But it is unclear when his fixtures are or if he can get away for a few days. His spokeswoman said it is too early to jump to conclusions. The Queen has invited Harry and Meghan and their children Archie, who turns three today, and 11-month-old Lilibet for the celebrations but there will be some parts to which they will not be invited as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family. But Harry, 37, has previously suggested that it is not safe for him and his family in Britain. He is suing the Home Office over the refusal of automatic security since they quit official royal duties and moved to Montecito, near Santa Barbara. Organisers of some Jubilee events are dreading the Sussexes taking attention away from the Queen. "If they come it's going to turn it into a circus," one organiser said." But the Queen is understood to be keen to heal the rift in her family. Harry has committed to play with the newly formed Los Padres team, which includes his old friend Nacho Figueras. Mr Figueras said: "We decided to play in Santa Barbara because Harry lives here. We came up with the idea to be able to use our team for charitable purposes."
