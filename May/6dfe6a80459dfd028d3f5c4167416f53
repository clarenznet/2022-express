Tom Hanks fans took to Twitter after thinking they'd spotted the Forrest Gump icon at the opening of the Elizabeth line yesterday. A post on the micro-blogging platform soon went viral following the uncanny spot, as one Twitter user told how they did a double take after thinking they'd spotted the Hollywood star in the background. The series of snaps showed the Queen dressed in a yellow number as she officially opened the train line. Officials could be seen standing around her, but it was what was in the background that interested social media users the most. At the edge of the snap a man could be seen leaning out of a doorway while looking in the direction of the Queen. The onlooker bore an uncanny resemblance to Tom Hanks in 1994 film Forrest Gump, which soon caused a stir online.
