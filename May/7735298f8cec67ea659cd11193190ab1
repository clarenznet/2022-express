In his Spring Statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak promised to cut fuel duty by 5p per litre. This was, he said, to help ease the pressure of the cost of living crisis. The decision took effect on March 23 at 6pm, and marked the first time in 20 years that the cost had been cut. Mr Sunak told MPs that the cut will last until March 2023 and will help save families and businesses more than £5billion. It was around this time that the RAC revealed that the price of fuel had broken records. RAC Fuel Watch data recorded a new record-high price of 167.3p only the day before the fuel duty cut was implemented. By the end of March, it reported that the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol soared by 11.62p to 163.28p per litre. The story was even worse for diesel, which shot up by 22.06p per litre to 177.29p, having peaked at 179.9p on March 23. Prices at the pump have since fallen but only slightly. Now, motorists up and down the country will be shocked to see UK Government figures on fuel prices from the last 20 years and how much they have ballooned. Data compiled by Express.co.uk from 2004 to 2022 show an uptick of nearly 100p — a staggering amount when compared to wages and annual growth rate alongside rising costs in other aspects of life.

This steadily increased through to mid-2008, when the global financial crash saw petrol skyrocket to 119.44p per litre and diesel 132.87p per litre. Shortly, however, prices sank to 2005 levels, easing the burden of inflation on Britons. By 2009, Petrol cost 85.42p per litre, while diesel came in at 98.45p per litre. This did not last long, with prices from that point until four years later in 2013 rising and rising to the highest point in nearly a decade. While petrol came in at 139.86p per litre, diesel cost 146.34p per litre. This was the most expensive petrol and diesel would be for another two years, as prices plunged until 2016 at 102.04p per litre and 101.17p per litre respectively. On average, from this point, prices for both petrol and diesel continued to grow exponentially apart from a brief blip halfway through 2020.

The RAC said that the price of petrol soaring to 163.28p per litre was the largest increase it has ever recorded in a single month. While it commended the Government's 5p fuel cut, it noted that the policy in its early stages had been "disappointing". Simon Williams, the RAC's fuel spokesman, said in late April: "Petrol prices have only come down by an average of 3.73p since 23 March, taking them to a level seen just three-and-a-half weeks ago, with diesel down even less – by just 2.61p on average.  "The fact pump prices have fallen so little reflects the fact that the cost to retailers of buying fuel had been going up ahead of the Spring Statement. "Had the Chancellor temporarily cut VAT rather than fuel duty on fuel, as we asked him to do, the impact on pump prices would have been immediate with drivers benefitting straight away." A month on and the prices at most petrol station forecourts have improved. But the cost of petrol still remains considerably higher than it did even at the beginning of the year. Some experts say that the full effects of Mr Sunak's intervention have not been felt because retailers paid more for fuel before his announcement. The day he confirmed his decision, the price of oil jumped by $6 (£4.79) a barrel, meaning many retailers had already paid the higher price. But, as the RAC noted in a blog post about the crisis: "If the Chancellor hadn’t cut duty, drivers would have been paying even more for their fuel then they had been."
