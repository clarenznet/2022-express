Former Labour MP Lord Pendry, 87, appealed against the findings of the Standards Commissioner but it was rejected after the report was approved by the Lords Conduct Committee. A complaint was upheld that the peer breached the code of conduct after he was said to have been "verbally aggressive" and exhibited "intimidating behaviour" to the security guard, who had challenged an unescorted guest in Parliament last July.  The guard, who served in the Army, described being "physically shaken and unnerved" after the "angry" peer challenged them and allegedly grabbed their radio during "a little bit of a tussle". Lord Pendry conceded he had "ticked off forcibly" the guard but noted staff were "flexing their muscles" against politicians in a manner he had not seen in 50 years in Parliament. Barrister Akbar Khan, one of the Lords' standards commissioners, said: "I find he has shown little insight or contrition in respect of his conduct or its impact on the complainant," Lord Pendry was MP for Stalybridge and Hyde in Greater Manchester for 31 years before becoming a peer in 2001.
