Catherine Zeta Jones looks like she hasn't aged a day following unearthed snaps with legendary actor, Sir David Jason. The Hollywood actress, 52, who played Mariette on the show, starred alongside the Only Fools and Horses actor, 82, in popular series, The Darling Buds of May, where he played 'Pop' Larkin.  Cosied up side by side, the duo grinned from ear to ear as they were pictured together at the launch of the second series of the show in 1992. The Welsh beauty affectionately placed an arm through David's as they sat on a bench together. Catherine looked super chic in thick black tights which she paired with an oversized cream blazer which featured large gold buttons. She wore her hair in a fashionable bob which had been curled to rest on her shoulders. David cut a smart casual picture in a pair of light blue trousers alongside a worn-in leather jacket. Catherine appeared in 18 episodes of the hit show and played the eldest Larkin daughter.
