Laura recently took to Instagram to share the news her grandmother had sadly died. She wrote yesterday: "From the stories you shared of memories long ago, to jumping the waves in Florida and holding my hand in the snow... "The role play you entertained me with when I was a little girl, playing shops and hairdressers, a time I remember well. "Nan, I am grateful for the times we shared over the last 40 years. "Now you are in a better place to erase away all those fears." The emotional presenter went on to write: "As I stroked your arm and tickled your hand, I cried many a tear as you left for a faraway land." Finally, she concluded: "Now you are at peace Nan. I Love you Laura xxx" The star shared a video and photo montage of the pair together, alongside the soundtrack Angel by Sarah McLachlan.
