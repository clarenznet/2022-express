Monkeypox has spread to eight people in the UK, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced earlier this week, with experts estimating the actual caseload may have reached the "tens". Additional confirmed and suspected infections in Portugal, Spain and the US bring the prospective total past 30, making the outbreak one of the most significant in history. Officials are working to discover the outbreak's source, as monkeypox is traditionally endemic thousands of miles to the east of Europe.  The monkeypox outbreak in Europe has bemused health officials as cases don't typically anchor themselves outside Africa. The first-ever case was detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970, not long after the country eliminated smallpox in 1968. Since then, it has stuck to the area, predominantly infecting people in central and western regions on the African continent.

They include:  Viruses spread through symptoms, with the most infectious - such as Covid - acquiring airborne "aerosol" transmission that propels it via coughs and sneezes. Monkeypox, on the other hand, has limited transmission avenues, as its hallmark symptom is a pus-filled rash. Both animal to human and human to human transmission requires contact with the fluid the rash produces.  People can become infected via pus or its byproducts, as the pock-like rashes tend to scab over. Other bodily fluids such as blood and mucus can also facilitate the disease's spread. The virus' limitations give it a low pandemic risk, as most people who contract it from others need contact with clothing or bedsheets carrying infected fluids. The WHO states that respiratory transmission requires "prolonged face-to-face transmission", meaning it would struggle to gain traction.
