Karl Townsend and Jamie Cunningham were on trial accused of murdering Jordan Brophy, 31, after he and three other men broke into the home Townsend shared with his partner and their child. A court heard Townsend, 32, was alerted to the break-in after the Ring doorbell installed in his home was activated by the burglars and sent an alert to his phone. Prosecutors alleged Townsend and Cunningham went armed with knives to the house and Townsend then stabbed Mr Brophy in the property, before later knifing him in the jugular. Richard Pratt, QC, prosecuting, described Mr Brophy’s death as an attack carried out by Townsend for "revenge or punishment" and said Cunningham was crucial in carrying it out. Townsend admitted causing Mr Brophy’s death but said he was acting in self defence during the incident and feared for the safety of his partner and their child. Townsend and his half brother have both been on trial for murder and possession of a bladed article for the last three weeks. But on Friday, they were both discharged at Liverpool Crown Court after jurors were today unable to reach a verdict on either charge against Townsend. They were also unable to reach a verdict on the possession charge against 23-year-old Cunningham, who they cleared of murder. Prosecutors confirmed they intend to pursue a retrial of Townsend, Liverpool Echo reports.  The jury deliberated for eight hours and 52 minutes before agreeing to acquit Cunningham, from Halewood, of murder. The prosecution said it is yet to decide whether to pursue a retrial for the possession charge against Cunningham. The case has been listed for a further hearing later this month where prosecutors will provide an update.
