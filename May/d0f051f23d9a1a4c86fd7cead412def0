Amanda Holden, 51, looked amazing in pink as she modelled her pink ensemble in an office style video while holding a phone. The Britain's Got Talent judge sat on a desk while she lifted her leg up and down, flashing her toned pins in a very daring skirt. The tightly-fitted, pink silk skirt drew in the presenter's petite waist, with the choice of colour perfectly complimenting the star's complexion. She partnered the skirt with a bold, long sleeve tiger print top. Amanda went for a simple makeup look but made sure to go for a pink blush and lip gloss, complimenting her ensemble perfectly. She wore black stiletto heels and styled her blonde tresses in a light wave. Amanda posted the video on her Instagram in view of her 1.8 million followers, with the caption: "On Wednesdays we wear #Pink." Many social media users rushed to the comments to compliment the presenter for her latest look. Holdenizer said: "Who needs Barbie when you have Amanda." Kaelanvls_18 added: "I always love it when you wear pink Amanda!" Amanda is currently judging on Britain's Got Talent along with David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell.
