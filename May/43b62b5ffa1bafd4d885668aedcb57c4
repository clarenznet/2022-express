According to Bloomberg this morning, EU officials are ready to suspend Brexit trade deals with the UK if domestic legislation is enacted to lift the Northern Ireland Protocol. Liz Truss delivered a 72 hour-deadline to EU negotiators today to relent on their demands after talks so far have failed to find a solution. But the EU has not responded in kind to the threat, with an unnamed official claiming the bloc would rip up trade agreements made as part of the wider Brexit deal. This would reportedly result in freezing the privileged access that UK companies have to the EU single market and would halt talks over the status of Gibraltar. A suspension of the trade deal would effectively mean a return of the “no-deal Brexit” that negotiations prior to 2021 were meant to avoid. So, do you think the UK should walk away from the bloc entirely after its latest threats? Or should the UK work with the EU to find a solution that works for everyone?
