Boris Johnson will embark on a trip to Northern Ireland today as tensions with the EU skyrocket. Ministers last week reignited arguments with the bloc over its protocol governing trade with the UK, threatening to repeal it via unilateral action. While the threats have earned his Government swift condemnation, former Brexit minister David Frost has warned Mr Johnson has "no option" in the matter, adding that post-Brexit negotiations with the EU have “reached the end of the road”.  He urged the Prime Minister to "do the right thing" as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) continues to cite the protocol in its refusal to set up a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein. Former ministers have warned introducing legislation to unilaterally override the protocol would be both illegal and potentially set off a trade war with the EU at a time of financial instability in the UK. But what do you think, does the protocol have to go? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
