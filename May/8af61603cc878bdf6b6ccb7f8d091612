The Destiny makers began its latest This Week At Bungie post by speaking about the horrific school shooting at Uvalde, Texas. The attack by a gunman at Uvalde's Robb Elementary School killed 19 students - aged between just seven and 10 - and two teachers. At least 17 more were injured. The Uvalde school shooting was the deadliest US school shooting since the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The horrifying shooting has once again sparked discussions about America's gun laws and how stronger measures need to be in place, while there is also outrage surrounding the police response.  Texas police have confirmed the gunman was not confronted by police before he entered the school, and that officers waited an hour before entering the school the gunman had been holed up in. Speaking about the latest horrifying instance of gun crime - which comes a few weeks after the Buffalo mass shooting which is being investigated as a "racially motivated hate crime" - Bungie said: "Before we begin todayâ€™s TWAB, we wanted to acknowledge the horrific events in Uvalde, TX, earlier this week. We are all shocked and saddened by this unprovoked madness and our hearts go out to the victims and their families. "It's our hope that games and supportive communities can provide respite, and we encourage everyone to prioritize their own mental health needs right now, whether that means gaining comfort from your hobbies or taking a break to focus on yourself and your loved ones. Take care of one another."
