Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid skewered Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting as pressure mounts on Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer over so-called 'beergate' claims. She also probed the minister on how the Labour Party had to admit its deputy leader Angela Rayner was present when Starmer was caught on a video drinking with party workers during a coronavirus lockdown. Streeting explained: "Well Keir never denied he was in Durham and it was perfectly legitimate, and it was allowed within the rules at that time."Reid chimed in: "Can I just interrupt? He might not deny that he was there, but the party did say that Angela Rayner wasn't there and then had to admit that Angela Rayner was there."So what is the difference there?"As Streeting claimed the situation with Rayner was a "genuinely honest mistake", Susanna interjected: "In some people's minds it was an honest mistake, in others, it was a lie. It wasn't true, was it? She was there."

Reid cut the minister off to add: "What matters is honesty and transparency." She continued to speak over Streeting and told him the 'beergate' meeting was "pre-planned". Many viewers took to Twitter to comment on the debate between Reid and Streeting, with some commenting on the GMB presenter's "interruptions".  Kate McCausland said: "Well done Wes Streeting for remaining dignified despite interruptions from the presenters. "As has been pointed out when planning a work event, time is set aside for food and that is allowed. Pity though Sir Keir cancelled today's Q and A." Shane Levitt added: "Dear me that was a terrible display from Susanna, they planned to eat a takeaway that is hardly comparable to the stuff that happened in Downing Street. Fine or no fine." However, other viewers praised Reid's style of interviewing, with Tom Robins adding: "#GMB Susanna Reid quizzes Wes Streeting about Keir Starmer and Durhamgate very forensically. She quickly gets to the similarity between Partygate, Johnson and the truth. Great to see Streeting squirm and deflect."

Oh my god @susannareid100, just asked him about a leadership challenge!" The interview comes in the wake of Starmer facing allegations he too had a beer in a room with colleagues during lockdown restrictions. The Labour leader has been hugely vocal about Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the 'partygate' Downing Street gatherings during lockdown, but he is not being investigated by Durham Police. Starmer has stated he was working in Durham and stopped to eat and was filmed having a drink last April.  It was at a time when restrictions banned household mixing indoors, apart from working. The Labour Party event took place in the constituency office of the City of Durham MP Mary Foy. When party officials were approached by Daily Mail reporters in January, they were told Rayner was not present. However after the publication produced video evidence she had joined Starmer at the gathering, they admitted she had been there. Good Morning Britain continues weekdays on ITV between 6am and 9am.
