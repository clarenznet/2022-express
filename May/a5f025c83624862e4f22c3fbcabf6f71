Passersby could scarcely believe their eyes as actress Julia Fox, who had a fling with Kanye West recently, stripped off almost completely for the trip to buy essentials yesterday. She tied the legs of her jeans together to form a handbag handle, and used the pockets to store her personal belongings. Julia gave onlookers an eyeful as she strode around in a sporty black lingerie set with a white trim, which she paired with knee high denim boots. The scantily clad star also donned a loose-fitting denim blazer over the top, in the same faded fabric as her boots, to accessorise her barely-there lingerie look. Julia was an extraordinary sight as she pushed a shopping trolley packed with carrier bags around Hollywood. She gave a scandalous new meaning to the term "lounge wear" when she seemed to deem her jeans unnecessary for the shopping trip. Meanwhile, there has been talk of the 32-year-old joining the cast of Bravo TV show Real Housewives of New York City - although some might say her grocery shopping outfit was anything but typical for the average housewife.
