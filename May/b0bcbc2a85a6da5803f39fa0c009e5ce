Sarah Gayton, shared space co-ordinator with the National Federation of the Blind, says in 32 trials across the country, scooters have been clogging up pavements in a clear breach of the law. She said: “They have been causing terrifying situations for pedestrians. So if they’re legalised, they are going to completely take over because the police can’t regulate them safely. “The urban environment will just literally change and people won’t want to walk any more.” The Government’s Transport Bill includes proposals to allow all private scooters to use roads and cycle lanes in the UK. Currently, they can only be used on private land unless they have been rented for the trials. Sarah, who travelled to Downing Street to present a petition last week, said: “I’m not over-exaggerating when I say that we are absolutely terrified.” Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Neville-Rolfe claimed delays in regulating the use of e-scooters have created a “Wild West” on the nation’s streets. She said: “I would ban e-scooters – I think e-bikes are much less dangerous.” A Government spokeswoman said: “Safety will always be our top priority.” At least three people, including a 14-year-old girl, have died while riding scooters in the last year.
