Ukraine continues to strike back against Russia's invasion, and the weight of Europe was thrown behind the country on Saturday night when the Ukrainian entry Kalush Orchestra bagged the competition's coveted top spot. Ukraine has already expressed its wish to host the contest next year in Mariupol, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Facebook post: "Our courage impresses the world our music conquers Europe! "Next year Ukraine will host Eurovision! For the third time in its history. And I believe - not for the last time."  Kalush Orchestra rapper Oleh Psiuk also said ahead of the event: “Eurovision next year will be in the free home and reconstructed and rebuilt and happy Ukraine." If Ukraine is unable to host the contest next year, another country will need to step in and it may be one of the 'big five' Eurovision countries - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Britain placed second in Eurovision 2022 with TikTok star Sam Ryder, so should the UK host the Eurovision 2023 contest in Ukraine's stead for the first time since 1998?
