The Great British Bake Off finalist Laura Adlington was left "mortified" after she accidentally flashed her bottom to builders who were hard at work. The 31-year-old made the mistake of drawing her curtains before she revealed more than was intended. Taking to Instagram stories, Laura appeared deep in thought, as she began: "So I've just opened the enormous curtains in my hotel room, butt naked to three builders on scaffolding that are probably about five metres away from my face. "Not just my face..." She then hollered: "To wahey. I immediately shut the curtains and now dying. Literally dying." The Bake Off finalist shared another photo where she sported a shocked expression on her face. She captioned the post: "Mortified." In a follow-up post, she shared a photo of the builders on scaffolding, and added: "Hope you enjoyed the show lads."
