The cancer campaigner said she was "blown away" by advance sales for How To Live When You Could Be Dead, due out on August 18, after being brought forward from 2023. But she revealed her book won't be published until "long after I'm flying high". Podcaster Deborah, 40, is receiving end-of-life care at home. She marked the book news with a "perfect" morning at RHS Wisley, Surrey, with husband Sebastien. She wrote: "Seb whisked me (bit of a mission but worth it!) at the crack of dawn to @rhswisley before all the crowds, to say well done for the book launch. It was just perfect for an hour. I haven't left the house in 10 days as have been too weak. "I love this picture reminding me of vibrant green life all around, despite the sadness of knowing the state of my body inside."  The host of You, Me and the Big C added: "I'm blown away and utterly grateful by the response to the book pre-launch and the sheer numbers of you who have kindly ordered it "It's always been my pipe dream to write a Times bestseller. "My first book just missed out, so maybe just maybe I'll never know about this one, but I'm sure I'll be celebrating somewhere!!" Three pounds from every book sold will go to her Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research. The mum-of-two has already raised more than Â£6.3million through her JustGiving appeal.
