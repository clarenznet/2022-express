The flight, LS134, took off from Malaga in Spain at 11:55am this morning (May 5), and was due to land at Glasgow Airport at 2:25pm. However, the flight issued a 'Squawk 7700' code while in mid-air. The code was issued by the pilot while flying over the Bay of Biscay close to the city of Lorient. A ' Squawk 7700' code is used to indicate a general emergency. It is used by staff onboard the airport to indicate to all tracking ground controllers that the flight has an emergency and should be given appropriate assistance. The emergency call came around two hours into the flight, according to flight tracking site Flightradar24. The plane was diverted and landed at Nantes Atlantique Airport just after 12:20pm. After issuing the code, the plane took a rapid descent from a cruising altitude of 36,000 ft to just 4,000 ft. This took around 13 minutes. Jet2 confirmed the pilot issued the emergency code due to a passenger onboard needing medical attention.

The '7700' code can be used for any type of air emergency - which can range from engine failure, pressurisation issues, other technical problems or a medical emergency. When an emergency is declared, air traffic control (ATC) gives the flight “priority.” Other air traffic can be diverted out of the way so the aircraft can get to the runway as quickly as possible. The crew onboard the flight are provided with details about the weather conditions and guidance to the runway in addition to navigation frequencies by ATC staff. The emergency services can also be notified by the team on the ground – if required – in preparation for the plane to land.
