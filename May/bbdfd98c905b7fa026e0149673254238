The pair, winners of 12 Olympic gold medals, were given titles for services to the sport – with Laura, 30, saying she told the Prince she “felt really nervous”. When William revealed to Sir Jason, 34, Laura claimed he will not be coaching his wife, the retired star replied: “She doesn’t listen to me anyway.” More seriously, Laura later told how she felt “lonely” after losing their unborn child and explained she posted last month about the miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy to “give support to other women”. She added: “By stepping out and saying, ‘Look, it can happen to anyone and it happened to us’, it gave lots of people a platform.”
