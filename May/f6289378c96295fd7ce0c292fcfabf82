The Duke and Duchess of Sussex tied the knot in a lavish ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor four years ago. Royal expert Duncan Larcombe claims that, to mark the occasion, Harry and Meghan will make their kids the "priority" rather than hosting an extravagant party. This year marks the third time the couple will celebrate their anniversary in the US, and any celebrations will likely be limited to just the couple and their children – three-year-old Archie, and Lilibet, who turns one next month.Mr Larcombe claims this is due to the distance separating the Royal Family from the couple’s home in Santa Barbara but also because Meghan isn’t in contact with many members of her family.Speaking to OK! Magazine, the royal expert said: "It's amazing really that four years ago there were nearly two billion people watching as they got married in the wonderful fanfare."And here they are four years on very, very isolated. Meghan isn't speaking to anyone in her family apart from her mum".He continued: "When you've got kids they are the priority. So I think you'd expect them to mark the day as a family alone rather than having a big party or anything like that."FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES
