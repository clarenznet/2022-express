US pathologist Michael Hunter says he believes Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after witnessing her husband's murder in 1963. And he suggests her condition helped trigger the blood cancer that claimed her life at the age of 64 in May 1994, according to a new episode of US series Autopsy: The Last Hours Of... After piecing together the former First Lady's autopsy report and medical files, and interviewing friends, Dr Hunter reveals: "There was a jigsaw of traumas and tragedy that, when pieced together, gives us a much clearer picture of why she died, most likely from a combination of factors." These include a lifelong smoking habit as well as daily "miracle jabs", which JFK and Jackie were given by his doctor. The programme, which will air in the UK later this year, was told they contained "amphetamines, vitamins, hormones and sometimes barbiturates".  But Dr Hunter concluded: "For me, the smoking gun is the undiagnosed PTSD. Those most at risk for lymphoma are people with impaired immune systems and studies have put PTSD sufferers in this at-risk group. "So, the question is: Did the assassin's bullet kill two people in the motorcade that day?"
