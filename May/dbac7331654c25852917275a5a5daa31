Victoria is happy about the move as she “can’t bear” to be too far away from her eldest son. Brooklyn is said to be ready to move across the pond with Nicola so he can be closer to his family. The pair got married last month in a glamorous Palm Beach wedding, and now, the pair are making plans for the future. Brooklyn and Nicola have spent much of their relationship in the US, but now they want to change things up and find a home in the UK, according to reports. The pair are reportedly planning on dividing their time between the two countries. “Brooklyn and Nicola are hoping to get a place over here and Victoria’s keen for them to be together more as a family because they’re so split up,” an inside source claimed. “She can’t bear being so far away,” they added. Brooklyn is the first of the Beckham children to get married and completely flee the nest.
