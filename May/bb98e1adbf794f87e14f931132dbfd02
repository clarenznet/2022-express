Bridgerton stars Phoebe Dynevor and Regé-Jean Page have reunited at New York City’s Met Gala. The two stars posed in snaps together for the event following reports Regé ditched the second series due to "creative differences".  Regé-Jean did not appear in the second season of the period drama, with Phoebe, who played his wife, appearing solo. The pair could be seen cosying up to each other following season one’s critical success. It saw Phoebe play Daphne Basset and Rege Jean play her love interest, Simon.  In the snap from the evening, Phoebe wore a black sheer gown embellished with intricate bead patterns and a short frill overskirt.  Regé-Jean meanwhile went for a deep blue velvet tuxedo as his admirers watched him pose on the red carpet. It was reported the actor wasn't a fan of the storyline Bridgerton had planned for him in the second series. A source told Page Six: "Regé is not coming back to Bridgerton because of creative differences with [executive producer] Shonda Rhimes and her team. "He wasn’t happy with what was planned for his character for Season 2, which would have kept him a player but not the focal point of the show." But Regé dismissed reports of a feud, confirming in an interview he was only ever intended to star in one series.  "It's a one-season arc. It’s going to have a beginning, middle, end – give us a year," he told Variety. "[I thought] 'That’s interesting,' because then it felt like a limited series. I get to come in, I get to contribute my bit and then the Bridgerton family rolls on."
