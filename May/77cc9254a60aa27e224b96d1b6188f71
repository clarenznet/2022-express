The female lurcher, who has been named Sandy, was found on her own outside Holsworthy Police Station in Devon on Monday. Despite efforts to track down her history or previous owners nothing has come up. Torridge District Council has issued an urgent appeal to find Sandy a home as local rescue centres are full up. A spokesperson for the council said: "Sandyâ€™s handlers describe her as a gentle but timid girl who is looking for a loving owner to help her grow in confidence. "She loves the company of people and enjoys human affection. "Unfortunately, Sandy has not had the best of starts to life and gets very anxious when closed into smaller spaces overnight." The council said staff at the kennels Sandy is being kept at have "fallen in love with her". It added that she "would make a lovely companion for the right person". Sandy's ideal home would be one where she is the only pet with no children. The council is looking for an owner who has previous experience of rescue dogs who will spend lots of time helping her settle in. Sandy would need to be walked on the lead unless she is in a secure field with no other dogs. The council will be carrying out home checks on potential adopters.
