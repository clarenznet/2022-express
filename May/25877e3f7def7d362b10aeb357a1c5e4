Photos shared on social media show a huge police presence in Birmingham city centre, near the busy New Street Station, after the youths reportedly gathered to cause "chaos". At least seven police vehicles, including vans, are seen lining a street in one image, shared on Twitter at around 5.30pm. Three teenagers were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and assaulting a police officer, Birmingham Live reports. A dispersal order has been imposed following "a number of disorders" and will remain in place until 5pm today, West Midlands Police say. One witness said: "I was stood outside Tesco and a bunch of young guys started fighting. "There were a lot of them, easily had to be 100. It started at the top by the Iron Man and it came down New Street. Then the police came and dispersed them. I’m not sure if any arrests were made. This was about 5pm."  Jordan Jacob, 23, who saw the disorder said: "There were quite a few school kids there, maybe 20 if not more. "Someone shoved someone and the kids were watching. "Everyone was running over to see what was happening. Lots of police came and they went over." A Twitter user posted: "Lots of police and chaos at the junction of New St and Temple St. Lots of people gathering and some running from the scene. Seen one person was detained and bundled into the back of a Police van." A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: "We currently have a dispersal order in place in Birmingham city centre following a number of disorders today. "Three teenagers have been arrested for violent disorder and assaulting a police officer. "The dispersal order will be in place until 5pm on Wednesday evening, allowing officers to disperse people or groups likely to cause anti-social behaviour."
