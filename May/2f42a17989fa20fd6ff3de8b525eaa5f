The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has overturned its draft rejection of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and has said women can take the immunotherapy drug alongside chemotherapy. The drug is for women with incurable secondary triple negative breast cancer. It aims to slow disease progression – buying patients extra time. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said it was “absolutely fantastic news for around 100 patients” every year with the disease. She added: “Following its worrying provisional rejection by Nice earlier this year, the reversal of this decision now brings hope to eligible women. “It could bring precious additional time before their disease progresses, and more months to live and spend time with loved ones and doing what matters most to them.”
