The supermarket giant will stop selling Russian diesel by the end of the year. The supermarket giant's decision comes in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine which has seen retailers remove Russian products to show solidarity, reports Birmingham Live. Rhian Bartlett, food commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We stand united with the people of Ukraine and have taken a range of steps to show our support - from helping to fund the humanitarian effort on the ground, to removing products from our stores which are 100% sourced from Russia. "We have been working hard to reduce the amount of diesel we sell which comes from Russia since the early days of the conflict." The spokesperson continued: "This is a complex process but we are committed to working together with the rest of the UK fuel industry and Government to support the ban on Russian oil imports, which is due to take effect by the end of this year." Diesel prices have soared to a new record high despite the cut in fuel duty, figures show. The average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts on Monday was 178.4p, according to Government data. The previous record of 177.5p was set two days before Chancellor Rishi Sunak implemented a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty on March 23. Analysis by the PA news agency revealed that filling up a typical 55-litre family diesel car is around Â£26 more expensive than it was a year ago. This is due to a 48p per litre rise in average prices. Back in March, Sainsbury's joined other retailers in showing they were against Russia's invasion of Ukraine by removing all products that are 100% sourced from Russia including Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds.
