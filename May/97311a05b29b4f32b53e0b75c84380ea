The National Lottery will reveal the winning numbers for its rollover jackpot tonight. For £2 a ticket, lottery players are in with a chance to claim a £5 million prize. The jackpot isn't the lone opportunity for one lucky Briton to become a millionaire, as there are also several runner up prizes. The May 4 jackpot is the product of an unclaimed jackpot, which the National Lottery has now "rolled over" into another prize. People only need to buy one ticket to enter and either choose their own numbers from one to 59 or let the lottery choose for them. They only have a few hours left to enter until the results tonight.

They had a chance to vie for an even larger sum during May 3's EuroMillions draw. Yesterday's draw came with a mammoth £145 million jackpot and £500,000 Thunderball. The winning numbers for both were released last night at 7.45pm and 8.06pm. The winning numbers for the jackpot were 8, 20, 26, 47 and 48. The lucky stars, which are vital for claiming the top prize, were 3 and 8. The Thunderball draw came with the numbers 1, 18, 20, 25 and 26, with a Thunderball of 3. Those who didn't win the top two prizes could also claim £130,000 for five numbers and a lucky star, and £13,000 for five numbers alone.
