The new addition, measuring 14 storeys and weighing 208 tonnes, is capable of destroying "half the coast of a continent", Rogozin claimed. He said Russia will soon have 50 missiles of its kind, adding: "With a nuclear charge, such a crater at an enemy site will beâ€¦well, very large and very deep - and radioactive.
