A woman travelling alone on a bike she named Roz attracted interest from people unused to Westerners. In Iran, she was pelted with rocks while in Madagascar she suffered broken ribs and Hepatitis A. Born in Lismore, Co Waterford, Ireland, her father was a county librarian, but her mother suffered from arthritis, which meant she needed constant care as she got older.  Murphy was schooled at a convent and it wasn’t until she was in her mid-30s, following the deaths of her parents, that she decided to see the world. Travelling alone didn’t bother her and she set out to find little-known corners of the world, which she described in detail. Readers were engrossed, but also enjoyed how she overcame the difficulties presented to her, from dust storms to black ice highon mountain passes.  In 1968 she had a daughter, Rachel, during a relationship with a married journalist, but didn’t let single motherhood stop her from travelling. She took Rachel along on her trip into the Peruvian Andes, which led to the 1983 book Eight Feet In The Andes. The eight feet was reference to a mule which helped make the trek a success. Asked once why she travelled so much, she said: “I need to get away from the artificial life of the West. When I set out on a journey, my spirits rise. I’m never lonely or frightened.”
