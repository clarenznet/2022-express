Laura Castle, 38, claimed 13-month-old Leiland-James Corkill fell off a sofa at their home in Barrow on January 6 last year. But doctors told Preston Crown Court that his injuries were like those of a high-speed car crash victim. The baby, who had lived with Castle and her husband Scott for five months, suffered a brain bleed and cardiac arrest and died the next day. Scott was cleared of allowing the death of a child. His wife will be sentenced next week.
