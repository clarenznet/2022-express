It might have been 5am, but Demi Rose, 27, took to her Instagram Stories at the crack of dawn nonetheless, urging her fans to "wake up". Mouthing along to some music, she revealed that a "last kiss was so good". Dazzling fans in a plunging black top revealing a generous amount of cleavage, she also sported winged eyeliner for a dramatic night-time look. The previous night, Demi had posted footage from a London club, where jazz and R&B artists covered tracks including Mary J Blige's 'Praise You'. The night out marked a rare moment at home for Demi, after months of almost continuous post-Covid jet-setting. The star had been seen beach-worshipping in Ibiza and St Lucia, as well as attending California's Coachella festival, to name just a few outings. Even if her travels are slowing down, her Instagram updates certainly aren't, much to the pleasure of her 19.4 million fans.
