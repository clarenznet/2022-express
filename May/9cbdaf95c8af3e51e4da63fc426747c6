The BA67 flight from London to Philadelphia took off shortly before 1pm on its usual route across the Atlantic. But shortly before the plane reached 12,000ft, the flight declared “Pan Pan” and squawked a “7700” code indicating a general emergency. The flight was bound for the east coast of the United States but was forced to divert to a London airport.     The aircraft, a Boeing 777-36N(ER), appears to have made a sudden landing at Heathrow Airport instead of its intended destination after issuing a general emergency code. The plane was tracked by Live Air Traffic website flightradar24 as it appeared to land at the airport in West London at around 2:45pm today [Tuesday, May 24]. The reason behind the emergency landing is currently unknown, but reports have suggested it may have been a pressurisation problem. A Twitter account that shares webcam footage from airports tweeded this afternoon: “INCIDENT: British Airways #BA67 London/Heathrow to Philadelphia (Boeing 777-300ER G-STBB) stopped the climb at 12,000ft, declared Pan Pan, squawked 7700 General Emergency due to a pressurisation problem (via ATC) & has just returned to LHR.”     An image appears to show the route the plane made, with the aircraft circling back round to Heathrow Airport before making the emergency landing. The flight returned to the London airport nine minutes after departure, with some who were tracking the plane watching it hold to prepare for a landing. British Airways (BA) has clarified the aircraft bound for Philadelphia (flight BAW67V) was not diverted back to Heathrow over an emergency. BA described the diversion as a "priority landing" due to a technical issue. A spokesperson at BA made the following statement: "The pilots requested a priority landing as a precaution due to a technical issue and the aircraft landed safely."
