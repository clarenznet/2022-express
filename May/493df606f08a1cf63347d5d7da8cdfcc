Tom Cruise, 59, put on a cosy display with co-star Jennifer Connelly as they made an appearance at the premiere of Top Gun: Maverick today. The star-studded event took place at the Palais des Festivals during the 75th annual Cannes Film Festival. Tom, who has returned to the film franchise as his famous character, LT Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, looked dapper in a black tuxedo. Jennifer, who plays Penny Benjamin in the film, dazzled at the premiere in an embroidered metallic maxi dress and slick-back bun. The pair beamed as they posed together for the cameras, with fans and photographers gathering around them. Tom wrapped his hand around Jennifer, while she beamed in front of the flashing cameras. He was later given an honorary Palme d’Or award by festival's president Pierre Lescure while the audience gave the actor a standing ovation.
