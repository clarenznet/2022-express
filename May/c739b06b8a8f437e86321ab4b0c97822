Responding to a tweet from a member of the US House of Representatives, the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that calling on the Northern Ireland Protocol to be implemented in full was "such folly". He said: "Implementing the protocol in full means ending grace periods, with an economic tsunami hitting Northern Ireland. Power sharing only works with cross community consensus. "There is no unionist support for the protocol. The protocol will destroy the GFA if not dealt with." US House of Representatives' member Brendan Boyle had called on the UK Government to "implement fully the NI Protocol, which avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, preserves the integrity of the EU Internal Market, and protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts". Earlier on Sunday, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long told Sky News that she understood border friction issues were "difficult" for unionists, but that it was an "inevitability as a consequence of Brexit". "Unfortunately, Brexit put borders and border friction back on the agenda, and that is very difficult for the very delicate ecology of Northern Ireland to deal with," she said. The DUP has refused to elect a speaker to the Northern Ireland Assembly in order to put pressure on the UK Government to change or remove the protocol. FOLLOW BELOW FOR BREXIT UPDATES:
