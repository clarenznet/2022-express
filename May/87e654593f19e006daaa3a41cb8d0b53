Tytyana had been featured on the tv series Growing Up Hip Hop, which documented her battle with addiction. It also showed her father and brother Romeo's efforts to help her maintain her sobriety. In a 2016 segment, she discussed, with her brother and father, the prospects of entering a rehab facility. She said: "I feel like I don't need to go to rehab - I feel like I could actually do good without rehab." To which Master P replied: "I mean you say that TyTy, but on the serious side, I think we should get some professional help just to make sure you stay on track. "I think you should at least try it, cause I don't want you to go back to this."
