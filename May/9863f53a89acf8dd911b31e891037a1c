The Defence Ministry announced that Russian troops practised the simulated "electronic launches" of nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile systems in the western enclave of Kaliningrad, in the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania. Single and multiple strikes were practiced at targets imitating launchers of missile systems, airfields, protected infrastructure, military equipment and command posts of a mock enemy. During the drills, military units, which involved over 100 troops, are also said to have rehearsed "actions in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination". No actual missiles were fired during the simulator tests. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
