Jenny Ryan, 40, looked amazing as she attended the BAFTA TV Awards this evening. The Vixen made sure to turn heads as she posed with her The Chase co-stars in a sparkly emerald green dress. The sparkly dress featured a tie element at the front, drawing in the quizzer's waist and showing off her curvaceous figure. She styled the outfit with black stiletto heels and white pearl earrings and a matching necklace. Jenny wore her signature glasses, accompanied with a bold red lip to finish her look. She fashioned her blonde tresses into a curled look, which complimented her elegant outfit. Jenny was accompanied by her fellow Chasers, Mark Labbett, Anne Hegerty and Paul Sinha. Anne matched with Jenny as she went for a sparkly blue dress and matching dark blue shoes. Mark continued to showcase his amazing weight loss as he wore a blue shirt and black suit, while Paul opted for a classic black suit and bow tie. However, the group's fellow ITV stars including Bradley Walsh, Shaun Wallace and Darragh Ennis seemed to be absent from the glitzy event.
