The US-based car company has long been associated with the UK and now tops a new study to find the most-loved car brand in the country. Ford, which has had a major factory in Dagenham since 1931, has four million owners in Britain according to the figures. The study was put together by online auction specialist BPI, who analysed the number of licensed cars by make and region to find the UK's most loved car brand. And it was Ford, followed by British brand Vauxhall and then Germany giants Volkswagen who made up the top three. The ownership statistics came from the Gov.uk website that tallies up the models owned in the UK. But Scotland didn’t quite follow suit, the brand most popular north of the border is Vauxhall, with over 296,000 of them registered.

That’s because speculation is rife that Ford are close to announcing the Fiesta will soon be all-electric. Production of the three-door Fiesta has already ceased and both models have already been dropped entirely in the United States. Vauxhall meanwhile look to be ready to dip into the past to find the future as they prepare to launch a new updated version of the classic Opel Manta.

Vauxhall recently announced £100million of investment into its plant in the north of England to prepare it to produce solely electric cars by the end of the decade. Ford for their part are about to unleash the Ford Mustang Mach-E GT EV which will do 0-60 in a staggering 3.5 seconds. The electric Mustang has been something of a surprise hit for the brand, especially in the US where it has won countless awards. As for Volkswagen, the German group announced in the past fortnight that it has ‘sold out’ of electric cars until well into 2023. They are soon to start selling the ID5, another large family car in the vein of the ID4, and the ID Buzz, an updated electric version of the classic 1960s campervan. It doesn’t appear to have given up on petrol completely however as this week it launched a 20th anniversary edition of the Golf R. The special edition has a sub-0-60 time, all-wheel drive, and is available in all-white with striking blue alloys.
