Hamilton responded on team radio moments after the crash, apologising to his team and asking to retire from the race. He said: “I would save this engine for you guys, I'm sorry.” But Mercedes quickly refused his request, claiming they could still score points later in the afternoon. However, Magnussen wasn’t happy with the seven-time champion claiming he had crashed into him on purpose. He said: “Lewis just rammed me! He knew what he was doing.” READ MORE: Mercedes predict they will 'close down' Ferrari and Red Bull Mercedes confirmed on Twitter that Hamilton suffered a front left puncture in the accident and was forced to pit.
