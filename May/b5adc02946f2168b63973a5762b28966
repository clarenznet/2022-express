Davina McCall danced and clapped in celebration as she enjoyed some time by the sea - and uploaded video footage to Instagram to share her joy. Showing off a neon pink off-the-shoulder bikini bra with matching bottoms, the 54-year-old announced: "One good thing about #Menopause .. u get an instant induction into the zero f***s club." Viewers with the volume up then heard what she was dancing along to - a song with the lyrics: "I have no more f**ks to give, my f**ks are running dry, I tried to go f**k shopping, but there's no f**ks left to buy!" Strictly Come Dancing star Oti Mabuse immediately appreciated the humour, firing back: "Hahahahahahahahaha this song is me on set! You look hot babeeeee." In view of her impressive follower list of 1.5 million, Davina had also added: "If u’ve run out of f***s to give this week, sending u so much love .." Actress Martine McCutcheon also responded to the post, exclaiming: "Hahahaha!!!!!!! I bloody love this so much! You’ve made my week! This is an ad in itself Davina!" Davina, who fronted the TV show Sex, Myths and the Menopause, also hashtagged the term #PeriMenopause. For those interested in her brightly coloured bikini, she tagged pricey American designer Melissa Odabash.
