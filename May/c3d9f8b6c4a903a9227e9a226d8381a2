Former Countdown maths whizz Carol Vorderman, 61, has long been known for her sex appeal, and she often takes every opportunity to flaunt her fit physique. This weekend, as it was announced that she is collaborating with a sports company to give away two free paddle boards, she wished her fans a happy Saturday. The voluptuous star posted a trio of outfit pics, which appeared to have been taken both before and after a workout. Carol, who attributes her youthful and age-defying looks to numerous factors, including regular exercise, flaunted her slim figure in a royal blue gym top in the snaps. She showed off her ample assets by combining the top with a snug pair of matching leggings. "It's Saturday," read the Instagram caption on the first snap, while in the second, Carol gushed over her BBC Radio Wales job, writing in view of her 219,000 followers: "I love it so much!" In one final mirror selfie, she wore the same outfit, but with dramatically tousled hair, quipping: "Happy Scruff!" Meanwhile, Carol has also shared news of her son Cameron King's recent graduation, after he achieved a masters degree in Animation and VFX. The Dundee University graduate's ceremony was held in a rugby stadium, which proud mother Carol quipped was a first for her.
