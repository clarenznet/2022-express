Lanes 1 and 2 out of 4 are closed on the M25 after a car smashed into an HGV. The accident occurred near a junction which currently has one of the highest recorded crash rates across England's motorways and major A roads. Emergency services are reportedly on their way to the scene. Delays are expected of up to 45 minutes, with miles of traffic reported on the motorway. The roads are closed clockwise between junction 10 to Cobham and junction 11 to Addlestone. This comes ahead of planned roadworks tonight at 10pm in the same spot of the motorway. The M25 anti-clockwise between junction 10 and junction 9 will be closed. It also shortly follows yesterday's announcement that transport secretary Grant Shapps has approved a major upgrade of junction 10 of the M25.  The plans will widen the motorway from three to four lanes. It will also increase the width of the adjoining A3 from three to four lanes in both directions. The junction is currently a hotspot for traffic collisions, and experiences heavy congestion every day. National Highways said the new project will reduce collisions by about a third. Other improvements include a new elongated roundabout to increase capacity, new dedicated free-flowing slip roads to reduce queuing, and better routes for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders.
