The woman, who was having a 'bad week', had paid a visit to Haydock Plaice in St Helens, Merseyside, with her cousin and children. After placing their order, the family took a seat outside. When the woman went back inside to pay, a staff member told her it had already been taken care of by a kind stranger, reports The Liverpool Echo. Unable to thank the woman in person, the mum took to Facebook in a bid to track her down.  She wrote: "Just want to put a thank you post on here and hope it reaches the lovely woman. "Myself and my cousin were just at Haydock Plaice chippy on Sherlock Ave with the kids in the prams. "We ordered ours and the kids' meals and waited outside. Some lady came outside, looked at my son in the pram spoke to us only for second, we walked back into the chippy to collect the food once it was done and to pay.  "The chippy told us that she had paid for our food. By the time we came to pay for the food, she had been gone a while so we couldn't say thank you or anything. "So if you are reading this we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. "We both haven't had the best of weeks and have been feeling down, we met up today to get the kids to the park for an hour so we both did something different than sitting at home dwelling on the bad times. "And to be told that some random kind lady has paid for our food has honestly made our whole week. It put a massive smile on our face and restored our faith in humanity. Such a kind soul."
