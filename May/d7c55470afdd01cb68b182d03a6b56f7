Cara Delevingne, 29, looked picture perfect as she posed in a white co-ord, showing off her sensational figure. The model left her toned abs on full display as she wore a white figure hugging maxi skirt and small strapless bandeau top. The tight top left her ample assets on full display, along with her gym honed arms. Adding sparkle to the outfit, Cara wore two bold silver necklaces, as well as a shimmering statement bold eyeliner. She styled her blonde locks in a wet look, while her makeup palette was simple, except for her wing eyeliner and bold eyeshadow. She posed at the event with Eli Mizrahi who looked stylish in a bright fuchsia suit and white trainers. This comes as the model took to the red carpet in a daring cut-out bandage dress, earlier that day. Cara looked sensational in her floor-length bandage sheer maxi dress, which featured a long trailing bustle that swept out behind her as she walked. She paired it with sheer black elbow-length gloves and looked every inch an opera star, while her pal Olivier opted for an all-white suit.
