  Britney, 40, posed against her bathroom door with her hair pinned up and only a heart emoji to cover her modesty. In the post, the singer told her 41.2 million followers: “GOOD my a** MURICA!!!” Some comments were positive, with fellow musician Demi Lovato writing: “You’re beautiful Britney.” Zach Pinsent added: “I’m so happy for you! Do whatever you want with your freedom x.”  While others appeared worried, with Coco asking: “Are you ok?” Stacey Griffith wrote: “Girl… Crying for help! Sad!” Five days ago, Britney announced she miscarried just a month after revealing she was pregnant. She told followers at the time that she and partner Sam Asghari, 28, had “lost our miracle baby”.
