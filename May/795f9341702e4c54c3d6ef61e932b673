Ronnie O'Sullivan searches for a record-equalling seventh World Snooker Championship triumph as he faces Judd Trump in the final of the 2022 tournament. Trump, the 2019 world champion, comes in off a semi-final win over Mark Williams that he has dubbed his "best ever" while O'Sullivan ousted John Higgins in another thrilling last-four clash. Sunday sessions at 1pm and 7pm LIVE: Ronnie O'Sullivan 5-1 Judd Trump Best of 35 frames Six-time world champion O'Sullivan can match Stephen Hendry's record of seven Crucible crowns, a record which has stood since 1999, if he beats Trump. The Rocket, 46, is the oldest finalist for 40 years and expects a real battle in Sheffield. He said: "Judd's going to be a tough nut to crack. I find this event really difficult. This venue just plays tricks with your mind. It's really tough. "I don't feel tired, it's just a difficult tournament. It's 17 days. It's just tough. Some people take to it a bit better than others. There's a bit of a circus this tournament. It's 17 days of stress this tournament, I need a detox." While Trump said: "It's a dream come true to play Ronnie in a world final. I think beating Mark is my best ever win. He was absolutely incredible. It was like playing a computer game on hard towards the end." This is O'Sullivan's eighth Crucible final and the world No 1's only loss came to Mark Selby in 2014, while No 4-ranked Trump - bidding to become just the seventh multiple-time champion ever - has only ever made the final once, when he beat Higgins three years ago.
