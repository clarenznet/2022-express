Jurgen Klopp said his Liverpool side are “men on a mission” ahead of their eagerly anticipated end to their title chase against Manchester City. The Reds will win their second Premier League title if they beat Wolves and Pep Guardiola’s side fail to overcome Steven Gerrard’s tenacious Aston Villa side. While the title remains firmly in Manchester City hands, the Reds still have a chance to complete an unprecedented ‘Quadruple’ triumph this season. Liverpool have already won the League Cup and the FA Cup, and still have a Champions League final clash against Liverpool at the Stade de France. However, Klopp did also reveal that his side will have to overcome Bruno Lage’s tricky Wolves side with Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah beginning the contest from the bench. The Liverpool duo both limped off during their FA Cup Final triumph against Chelsea, and have not been deemed fit enough to start against the Midlanders. They will also be missing Divock Origi, who is expected to depart the club and join AC Milan at the end of the season. But ahead of a potentially historic day for Liverpool and the Premier League as a whole, Klopp issued one final rallying cry to his side. "We decided a while ago that we are men on a mission and we do that since then,” Klopp said to Sky Sports News. “We try to win football games and nothing changes since then. The boys have given us the opportunity to be in it today. “We just have to enjoy the opportunity and try to win the football game here today which is difficult enough. That's all I'm concerned about. We have to be in the right mood - the whole stadium. Outside it looks like it means a lot to the people today. We will see what happens.
