Lord Alan Sugar has referred to the actor Johnny Depp as a “nutter” and his famous ex-wife Amber Heard as “tuppence short of two bob” on Twitter. The Apprentice star reached these conclusions on social media after questioning the necessity of the couple’s ongoing court battle.  Alan, 75, took to social media last week to ask about the ongoing defamation trial between Amber and Johnny. Reaching out to his 5.2 million Twitter followers on Thursday, he asked: “Can someone explain to me what Johnny Depp's case against his ex wife Amber Heard is all about? “The headlines are defamation. What does he expect to gain? “Both of them are washing their dirty laundry in public. WHY?” READ MORE: Meghan Markle's 'main issue' pointed out by Karren Brady      One Twitter user, Gertdog, replied to Alan with negative comments about Amber. They wrote: “She has spent 6 years accusing him of things he didn't do and ruined his life, now it's his time to tell the world the truth. “She's a big fat liar, and they have proved that,” they claimed. The trial remains ongoing and there have not yet been any legal judgements made.     In response to Gertdog, Alan wrote: “He is f..... nutter and she seems tuppence short of two bob.” (sic) The phrase Alan used to describe Amber is typically used to suggest that someone is not very bright or mentally unhinged. The Twitter user then hit back sarcastically: “Ahh I didn't realise you know them both. “Clearly you're not following the trial or looked at the evidence or you wouldn't have asked,” they added.

In the article, Amber claimed to be a domestic violence survivor, though she didn't name Johnny as the perpetrator. Johnny claims that he was the implied abuser and that it destroyed his career.      The trial seats seven jurors and is expected to last around six weeks. Amber is also counter-suing her ex-husband for $100 million. She accuses Johnny of orchestrating a “smear campaign” against her and describes his lawsuit as a continuation of “abuse and harassment”. The court battle, which is taking place at a court in Fairfax, Virginia, is set to resume on 16 May.
