Shani Warren, 26, was bound and gagged then dumped in Taplow Lake, Bucks, in April 1987. Serial sex attacker Donald Robertson, 66, was charged last year after a cold case review. DNA evidence linked him to Shani's murder and also the rape of a 17-year-old girl two months later. Robertson, who did not attend his Reading Crown Court trial, will be sentenced tomorrow. Police chief Peter Beirne branded him an "evil predator" who had attacked women and girls all his life.
