The United States Geological Survey USGS measured the quake as 4.3 magnitude on the Richter scale. Residents told the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre about the quake. One said: "Slow build, then strong jolt and softer longer shaking afterwards that lasted. Shook my bookcase, windows, doors. Didn’t hear it coming on."  Another said: "This woke me up. Gentle shaking back and forth and a dull noise? Not sure how to describe it but not as loud sounding as others have been. Just hope a bigger one isn't on its way."
