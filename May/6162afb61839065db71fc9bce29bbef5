Amanda Holden, 51, looked sensational as she wore a tight-fitting blue dress this morning while departing her radio show at Heart FM. The Britain’s Got Talent judge paired her stylish outfit with a pink crossbody bag and matching blush stilettos as she strutted through Leicester Square. The star had made her fans laugh this morning as she attempted to drink a whole can of Sprite without burping while hosting her radio show. Amanda shared the clip on Instagram of her seemingly managing to drink most of the can without burping, before letting out an enormous belch, leading viewers to collapse in hysterics. Callum_Campbell typed: “OMG Amanda that has made my morning ahahahah.” While danlar08 remarked: “Put me off you that. Unfollowed.” Despite the embarrassing gaffe, Amanda still managed to look chic as she wore her caramel tresses down in loose waves before exiting the building. She was captured by photographers strutting through central London wearing black sunglasses to protect her eyes from the balmy skies.
