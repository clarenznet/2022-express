Ulrika Jonsson, who also posed totally nude last year as part of a men's mental health awareness campaign, has defied her naysayers once again by stripping off on Instagram in honour of the heatwave in the UK. She updated her 191,000 followers on her sunshine ritual by donning a white bikini and captioning her photo: "That day of the year again when sun comes out." Another shot followed displaying her body stretched out on a sun lounger in the garden. Ulrika has regularly spoken out against those who criticise her bikini shots, believing that it's a matter of feminism. "I was born in an egalitarian country and I carry and apply that standard wherever I go," she wrote defiantly in a post for International Women's Day on Instagram earlier this year. "Sometimes digging my heels in and showing my obstinance makes others uncomfortable." She concluded: "If you’re not a feminist, you’re on the wrong side of equality."
