Hillary Clinton stunned as she graced the Met Gala last night following a 21 year absence. The former United States Secretary of State, 74, dazzled in a deep burgundy number which was embroidered with the names of historical women that she admires. Taking to the red carpet, the former first lady stunned in the evening gown which perfectly fit the Gilded Glamour and White Tie theme of the event. The dark red number featured long sleeves and a straight neckline which flashed Hillary's shoulders. Nipping her in at the waist, the garment fanned out in a beautiful A-line shape, leaving the wife of former resident Bill Clinton to pick up the fabric as it skimmed the floor. The intricate number was custom made by Joseph Altuzarra who had sewn over 60 names onto the garment, including that of Madeline Albright, Abigail Adams, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Lady Bird Johnson, and Hillary's mother, Dorothy Rodham.

Altuzarra said: "I knew that I wanted the dress to have a personal component for her. “When someone like Hillary goes to the Met, it’s not just like, ‘there’s Hillary at the Met and she’s wearing a dress.’ It has a lot of significance. “I felt like I had to be very thoughtful about what the dress would mean to the theme and to the occasion.”
