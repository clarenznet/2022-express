To many people who use the tube, the rules of the London Underground might seem rather simple. However, the tube welcomes around 1.35 billion passengers yearly - including tourists who may not be aware of the way Londoners behave. For instance, many of us will walk as fast as we can on the pavement, and not talk to someone on the Tube unless we absolutely have to.  One unfortunate American has taken to TikTok to express their confusion about the way we Brits travel. Posting a video on their page, the visitor said: “Did you know on the London Underground there are no stairs? So people will literally stand on the right to let people who want to walk down the escalators do so on the left. And it’s a common thing no one talks about.” The video quickly gained over 25,000 likes, but something about the comment that the underground had “no stairs” sent Londoners into hysterics. According to MyLondon, one user commented “No stairs? You haven’t been to Bank station in the morning then mate.” Other users echoed the sentiment, posting comments such as: “There are definitely stairs…” before also posting a ‘dead’ emoji. Another commented: “Have you been in Victoria station trying to get to Euston with a suitcase… Trust me there’s stairs.”  Users also objected to the video's statement that 'no one talks' about the lack of stairs inside the underground. One commenter said: “No one talks about?? It’s literally the number one rule in London and when tourists break it they will be tutted at v harshly.” They weren’t the only one referring back to the Tube’s unwritten rules. One wrote: “We do talk about it, having to remind tourists 100,000 times to move out of the way.” One TikToker had a theory that actually, this rule wasn’t so London specific at all - and that it might just be where the original poster was from that doesn’t do it. They said: “This is normal everywhere but the USA.”
