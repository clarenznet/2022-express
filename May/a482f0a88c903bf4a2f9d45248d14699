Anton Du Beke, 55, cut a smart figure as he took to Leicester Square to attend the premiere for Top Gun:Maverick. The Strictly Come Dancing judge was accompanied by his wife of five years Hannah Summers. Anton wore a bow tied suit, with the jacket featuring a soft dark blue velvet detail and a white pocket square. Meanwhile, Hannah looked the part in dark shades, a black blouse and smart black jeans. She accessorised with a Gucci belt and strapped black heels. Their attendance at the premiere comes as Anton has been tipped to become a permanent judge on Strictly after news broke of Bruno Tonioli's departure. Italian choreographer Bruno, 66, has been at the heart of the BBC dance contest since it began in 2004. But after two years of Covid travel restrictions kept him in America, he reportedly decided to leave and instead focus on judging the US version of Strictly. A source said: "Bruno has quit the show for good. He's going to be a judge only on Dancing With The Stars." The BBC told the Daily Express it would not be commenting on the news.
