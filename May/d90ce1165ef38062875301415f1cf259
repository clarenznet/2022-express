A YouGov poll carried out on 1,754 adults in the UK for the anti-monarchy group Republic between April 30 and May 2 shows that 27 percent of the people polled believe Britain should abolish the monarchy. On the other hand, 13 percent responded they didn't know. A significant 60 percent of the people who took part in the survey spoke in favour of retaining the monarchy in the future. However, the pro-republican sentiment has grown when similar polls taken over the past few years are compared. Another YouGov poll carried out between October 2 and November 22 2019 on 4,870 people showed only 19 percent would welcome replacing the sovereign with an elected head of state. Republic CEO Graham Smith said: "When looked at alongside other polls in recent years, it appears support for the monarchy is on a slow puncture." Nevertheless, despite younger generations in particular appearing more keen on republicanism than in the past, the UK is set to spend millions to properly celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, signalling there is still very much affection for the record-breaking monarch. The Centre for Retail Research reported Britons may spend some £408million on the Jubilee, including £281.5m just on memorabilia and presents. FOLLOW THE LIVEBLOG BELOW FOR UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY
