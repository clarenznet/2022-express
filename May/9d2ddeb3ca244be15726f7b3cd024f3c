Temperatures passed 104F (40C) in parts of the country last week while electricity demand in April was up 13.2 percent to a record high. With dwindling coal supplies, electricity failed as supply fell short by 1.8 percent - the worst gap since 2015. Demand in the capital Delhi surged 42 percent with a 75 percent rise in the north-east state of Sikkim. Heatwaves in India are common in May and June but March was the hottest for 122 years. PM Narendra Modi said: "Temperatures are rising rapidly in the country, and rising much earlier than usual."
