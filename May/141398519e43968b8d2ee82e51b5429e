  Comedian Sue Perkins called out Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie Johnson, yesterday for the controversial texts she sent in which she referred to friends of hers as “the gays”. Sue, 52, suggested that members of the LGBTQIA community were “not with” Carrie, 34, after her texts became the latest development of the Partygate scandal.    Carrie has been the subject of discussion after a text the Prime Minister’s wife sent, referring to some friends as “The Gays”, has become the latest focus of the ongoing Partygate scandal. Sue took to Twitter yesterday morning to call out Carrie in front of her 1.2 million followers. She wrote: “Pretty sure the gays ain’t with you tho #carriejohnson.” (sic) Following the release of the full Sue Gray report last week, which addresses a number of lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street, some new claims have emerged that rely on Carrie’s text as potential evidence.

Carrie allegedly sent messages to a Number 10 aide which suggested she hosted several friends in the flat for a gathering and that the Prime Minister also went up to the flat, according to The Sunday Times. According to the paper, the texts she sent that day "appear to show that she was in the flat with several friends on the evening of her husband's 56th birthday". "They also suggest that the prime minister went up to the flat, at a time when events or two or more people indoors were banned except for work purposes," the newspaper reported.     The Telegraph reported a text exchange between Carrie and the aide as Boris was heading to the flat, where she replied: “Great. I am here already with The Gays.” The paper suggested Carrie used the term to “affectionately” describe her close circle of gay male friends. The messages were not featured in Sue Gray's official report into parties in and around Downing Street. Sue Perkins’ Twitter followers took to the comments section to share their own thoughts on Carrie’s choice of language. READ MORE...

While Neil Campbell joked: “I'm not gay can I still not be with Carrie??” (sic) Boris’ spokesperson has claimed Sue Gray was made aware of Carrie’s texts "as part of her exhaustive inquiry into alleged breaches" of Covid rules. In response to this claim, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: "Another day. Another cover-up. Why won't No.10 tell the truth about yet another gathering - in the Downing Street flat on the PM's birthday? “This unexamined evidence must be handed over - and new questions about misconduct must now be answered.” Express.co.uk have contacted Carrie’s representatives for comment.
