EuroMillions is back tonight with an incredible £35 million up for grabs. There’s hope for Brits tonight as one very lucky couple took home the biggest ever UK EuroMillions win last Friday, scooping an unbelievable £184 million. Joe Thwaite, a communications sales engineer, and his wife, Jess, who runs a hair salon in Gloucester, went public after scooping Britain's biggest-ever lottery win last week. Mrs Thwaite said: "The win gives us time to dream which we haven't had before. "We've had one week to think about this and we now have time to share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends." The winning pair won with a Lucky Dip ticket, and broke the £170 million record won by a UK ticketholder in 2019.
