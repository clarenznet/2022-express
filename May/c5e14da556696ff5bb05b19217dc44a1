Lionel, who enjoyed eight decades in showbiz but was best-known recently as a team captain in ITV’s Give Us A Clue, passed away aged 92 last November. The star was a staunch believer in the importance of his family and attributed the success of his marriage to Susan.  He once said: “We’ve got a very, very normal family, and for me everything comes back to family. If they’re sad, I’m sad. I want them to be happy all the time.” He and Susan, 75, had three children, Daniel, Matt and Lucy and three grandchildren, who are all trustees to the estate.  The family lived in a £1.3million house in Banstead, Surrey, which Lionel saw as a retreat from his hectic show life. The much-loved performer was born Henry Lionel Ogus in Canada in 1928. His family moved to Stamford, north London two years later. He began acting aged 13, with his elder sister Joyce.
