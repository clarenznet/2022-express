Sir Elton John, 75, looked the epitome of elegance as he attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation gala, which was hosted by The Caring Family Foundation. It took place last night at Annabel's in London and saw the singer’s husband, David Furnish, accompany him. Elton dazzled in a show-stopping embroidered black suit that featured a large, intricate floral pattern. David opted for a cream suit with silk lapels and matching black Gucci bow ties with his beloved husband. Elton completed his look, which featured his initials on the blazer’s left lapel, with his staple oversized sunglasses. The event’s star-studded guest list saw well-known names from a range of different industries attend. Some A-listers in attendance included model Naomi Campbell, artist Tracey Emin and singer Ronan Keating.
