Ukraine forces succeeded for the first time in taking out a Russian 2S4 Tyulpan artillery system near Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The 2S4 Tyulpan is a powerful weapon and can fire massive 240 mm caliber 221-pound high explosive projectiles for up to 260 miles. Ukrainian soldiers were able to locate the deadly weapon after watching a TV broadcast from the frontline by a Russian journalist. Viktor Kovalenko, a Ukrainian army veteran, wrote on his Twitter page: "Ukrainian military was able to destroy 2S4 Tyulpan immediately after watching the TV report by the Russian propagandist Alex Koz (useful idiot). "He proudly reported about this deadly mortar on Russian TV and disclosed the exact location." Follow below for more updates...
