 Red Bull have been handed a penalty from the stewards immediately after FP1 at the Monaco Grand Prix. The team were issued a 300 fine after Sergio Perez was caught speeding in the pit lane.   The Mexican was recorded travelling 3km/h above the speed limit during the first session. However, the team will face no further punishment meaning Perez does not risk receiving any grid penalties.
