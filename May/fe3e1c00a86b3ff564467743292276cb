Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka is set to take part in the mixed doubles tournament at Wimbledon later on in the calendar year, with rumours claiming that controversial Australian hero Nick Kyrgios could be her partner.  Osaka, 24, has won four Grand Slam singles throughout her career, triumphing at the Australian Open and US Open twice each. However, she has struggled in doubles at Grand Slams - with her best ranking being a second-round finish at the French Open in 2016. That could change in the summer, with Osaka announcing she is set to feature in the doubles sector of the tournament in order to "focus on her net game." And whilst her partner is yet to be confirmed, she shares the same agent as the enigmatic Kyrgios - sparking rumours that he would be the one to join her on court. "So I have been like really trying to focus on my net game, because I'm going to play mixed doubles in Wimbledon," Osaka said. "I know, shocking, right? I'm shocked too. Your eyes got super big. "I really don't want to like disappoint the person I'm playing with, because whenever I play doubles I always say sorry. I'm going to try not to be a liability. If this person sees it and they want to like respond, they can do that, but I don't know. "Isn't it more fun to kind of see it when it's around the time? I'm pretty sure if you wanted to guess you could guess who it is." Osaka has won just two of her 16 outings in doubles format, a low number compared to Kyrgios' 50 per cent win ratio. He won the doubles tournament alongside fellow Australian star Thanasi Kokkinakis in Melbourne to signal themselves as the first Australian duo to win the tournament since 1997. Kyrgios is yet to taste a singles Grand Slam triumph, with his best finishes being quarter-final appearances at Wimbledon and the Australian Open in 2014 and 2015 respectively. And he will be hoping that himself and Osaka can work together as a team to complete a famous victory. Wimbledon commences in around two month's time.
