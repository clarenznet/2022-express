Silent Witness fans were thrilled to see the return of Amanda Burton during Monday night's episode as she made her comeback as Sam Ryder. However, just minutes into the episode, BBC viewers were left distracted after they spotted Vera star David Leon on the show. David is best known for playing DI Joe Ashworth in Vera alongside Brenda Blethyn. His character Joe left the ITV cop drama to spend more time with his wife and daughters. However, he was quickly replaced by Kenny Doughty, who has played Vera's sidekick Aiden Healy ever since. The actor, who stars as Oscar Harris in Silent Witness, has kept a low profile since he left Vera in 2014.

Amanda may have made a return to the BBC series, however ahead of the episode, the actress admitted she had never contemplated coming back. "No, quite frankly," she said to Express.co.uk and other press in a Q&A. "I had the pleasure of Emilia and I doing a photoshoot together about four years ago, and we were sort of laughing about it then. "But it was sort of, 'Yeah, right. You know, that's never going to happen.' "And then I got a call and I was just completely blown away by it. I'm very excited about the opportunity. So amazing." Silent Witness returns on Tuesday at 9pm on BBC One.
