For those who love meat and don't think they could live without it, having meat-free days could also make a difference to your wallet. Lara suggested "meat-free Mondays" for those who want to dip their toe in the waters of vegetarianism. Another option is only eating meat once per day, rather than as a component of every meal. Lara's next tip was to make use of the freezer and "stock up on freezer goods". This means that shoppers will always have "bulk" at home. Plus, freezing is easy and versatile: "Gosh, you can freeze everything pretty much." She advised doing a big shop just after payday, stocking up on loads of freezable foods. "As the month goes on you won't need to keep going in to buy fresh because you've got it in the freezer." A third top tip was to be slightly crafty when it comes to vegetables. Lara shared that she grates veggies such as courgettes and carrots into meals to bulk them out. This is also a great hack for parents and grandparents. Having "hidden veggies" in food may mean fussy children will eat more nutritious foods. Her final tip, which she emphasised as being crucial, was meal planning. "A bag of potatoes can go a long way, guys. "We're talking jacket potatoes, chips, wedges, mash, fried potatoes. "you can do so much with a bag of potatoes and it's so inexpensive."
