Charles Leclerc managed to claim pole position at his home race on the streets of Monaco after Carlos Sainz collided with Sergio Perez following the latter's heavy crash at the end of Q3. The Ferrari driver has experienced no shortage of bad luck in the principality over the last few years but will be hoping to convert his starting position into a maiden victory at the circuit over the course of Sunday's race. Max Verstappen will line up in fourth place after failing to keep up with the leaders over the course of qualifying in a major blow to the Dutchman's hopes of extending his Drivers' Championship advantage in Monaco. He will start one position ahead of Lando Norris, who managed to claim an impressive fifth-placed finish despite having battled with tonsillitis since last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. The session was marred by a last-minute crash involving Perez, who was unable to prevent his Red Bull car from skidding into the barriers on his final hot lap at the end of Q3. Sainz went on to make contact with the Mexican driver as he came around the right-hander at Portier, bringing a premature end to the day's on-track action as the red flags were brought out. Meanwhile, it was another laborious showing from Mercedes, who struggled to keep up with the quickest drivers in all three qualifying sessions. George Russell will be forced to start from sixth place when the five red lights go out on Sunday, with Lewis Hamilton all the way down in eighth after he was denied a final chance to climb up the order due to Perez's late incident.
