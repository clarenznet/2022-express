Six-year-old PD Xavier Charles, better known as "Stanley", collapsed early on Sunday morning.  The dog, who worked across London with his handler and best pal PD Stella, was described as "one of the very best" and a "wonderful, faithful and loyal friend" by the Met Police. They tweeted: "A larger-than-life character, Stan loved to work and amassed over 280 results in his shorter than average career and made it to the national police dog trials in 2019."
