In terms of foods you shouldn’t be consuming when on a diet, Susie revealed: “Drinks to be avoided are those that contain sugar such as fizzy soft drinks, alcohol and shop bought juices and smoothies. “A few glasses of alcohol a week will be ok but anything more won't aid progress. “The body processes alcohol in quite a different way as it's perceived as a toxin - it reduces the amount of fat our bodies burn for energy as well as acting as a potent appetite booster. “Fruit juice isn't ideal either as the fibre has been stripped out so the juice alone causes a huge glucose spike. “The jury is still out on zero sugar fizzy drinks but these still have sweetener added. “Even though there are often zero calories in these drinks, they can cause insulin to be released by the body due to the very sweet taste and can disrupt the gut microbes. “Drinks to focus on are tea, coffee, herbal teas, water, homemade smoothies and juices, fizzy water.” Susie works in Hertfordshire “supporting women in midlife with changes they are currently experiencing or those who would just like to align their body and lifestyle to prepare for changes that they may start to experience in the years ahead”. She helps with nutrition, weight management, gut health, sleep, movement and stress. The expert said: “I keep all my advice realistic and relatable by offering the practical application of well evidenced solutions to make positive and sustainable life changes. “I am a firm believer in offering a completely holistic approach; supporting the body to heal itself effectively whilst optimising nutrition.”
