According to the ports, Government delays on checks on European animals and plants announced mean high-tech facilities built for the inspections will remain empty until the end of 2023, costing the industry around £300 million. Trade body UK Major Ports Group told the Financial Times: “This now looks like wasted time, effort and money to develop what we fear will be highly bespoke white elephants.” Mike Sellers, Portsmouth International Port’s director, said following the news: “We now face significant capital liability on a building for which the future is uncertain. “This has always been raised as a concern with ministers and their officials and we will be pursuing compensation from the government as we look to recover costs.” The Government argued that delays will end up saving the industry £1 billion, despite ports building the infrastructure and hiring personnel. A Government spokesperson said: “Ports will benefit from streamlined processes and reduced congestion as a result of these controls no longer going ahead in July.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
