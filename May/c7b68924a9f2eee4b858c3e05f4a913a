The four-part Channel 5 programme sees Anneka, 63, and volunteers tackle everyday problems, meeting deserving communities and inspirational people. It first aired on BBC One from 1989 to 1995. Anneka will meet the individuals at the heart of each challenge and be briefed on the task. With "Dave the Soundman" Chapman, from the original series, she will call in favours from top brands, big names and helpers keen to lend a hand. Anneka said: "I can't believe this is actually happening.The last few years have shown us all the power of community and how it's good to be part of something bigger than ourselves. "Dave the Soundman and I may have 130 years between us but the whole team is as motivated as ever to make a difference and shine a spotlight on people and organisations. "Three decades on, the issues may look different but at their core they are the same - they're about people and communities. We may look a bit different too but our hearts and willingness to get stuck in are the same." Challenge Anneka will air this year.
