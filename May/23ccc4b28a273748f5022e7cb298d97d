New research has revealed that British motorists were given 10 parking fines every minute last year. The overall value of fines rose throughout 2021, with a total of £254.9 million issued to drivers, a six per cent increase on 2020 when £234.6 million worth of fines were issued. Last year, over 5.2 million penalty charge notices (PCNs) were issued for parking infringements across Britain. That equates to a rise of 400,000 (eight per cent) compared to 2020, when 4.8 million were issued and represents 1,300 more parking fines per day throughout the year. The rise in the PCNs issued across Britain comes as local councils expand the number of roads that have parking restrictions in place. Overall, 63 percent of councils increased the number of roads with parking restrictions, meaning 80,200 roads across Britain now have some level of restriction in place, 1,200 more than in 2020.

Meanwhile in London, nearly two million PCNs were issued last year, meaning the Capital accounted for over a third (37 percent) of all PCNs in 2021. This was followed by the South East (18 percent), the North West (13 percent) and the East Midlands (seven percent). The average value of PCNs handed out in London in 2021 was £74.37, which is 53 per cent higher than the British average of £43.63.

One Twitter user, Alex Evans, said the high cost of parking tickets was “destroying businesses”. They continued: “One of my issues with parking for instance is the destruction of town centres because the council would rather make a bit of money through tickets.” Top 10 local authorities by number of PCNs issued in 2021 Manchester: 341,000 Westminster: 274,000 Kensington & Chelsea: 153,000 Nottingham: 145,000 Islington: 145,000 City of London: 140,000 Brighton & Hove: 136,000 Winchester: 120,000 Camden: 127,000 Hammersmith & Fulham: 125,000
