It comes after the company already raised its prices at the start of the year. The company’s exiting CEO, Roger Whiteside, announced the news in an update to shareholders on Tuesday. He clarified that the price hike will only be on selective items and that it will be within the range of five to 10p. Mr Whiteside explained: “At the start of the year we made some increases and then, when the reduced rate of VAT went back to normal, we had to add that back onto prices where we’d been able to pass the reduction to customers during Covid”. And he added: “We are now going to have to make some increases again soon. “It will be on selected items, but it will be across different areas, so there might be 5p or 10p increases on some products.” Mr Whiteside stepped down from the position of the CEO and is being replaced by the company’s retail and property director, Roisin Currie. The company has said that the price increase is driven by higher taxes and soaring costs for energy, resources, and staff payments, Stoke-on-Trent reported. In total, costs for production have increased by 6-7 percent, the company has said. In its financial results, the company announced a 27 percent increase in sales year on year in the first months of 2022. And it pointed out to the devastating effects of the pandemic that had led sales to a dive in 2021.
