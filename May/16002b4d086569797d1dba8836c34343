After his death in 1973, Noel Coward was described as a “master of sophisticated and daring comedy” by the New York Times. But that might be an understatement. The star was famous in the 1920s for films, dramas, musicals, and for creating his own music. His most famous work includes the play Cavalcade and the film Brief Encounter. Coward, who was knighted in 1970 by Queen Elizabeth, died at the age of 73 while preparing his morning coffee, reported the New York Times. The actor was staying in his villa on the north coast of Jamaica before he died. He was buried on the island three days later. Heart attacks were prevalent in the 1960s and 70s, making up over 40 percent of deaths in the UK.

Many of his film characters also used to smoke – way before the film industry started using fake cigarettes. Smoking is linked to heart disease because it bumps up the amount of plaque in your blood vessels.  Plaque is made up of a hard collection of materials such as cholesterol and waste products in the blood. This can clog up your arteries meaning that less blood can flow to your heart. Other factors that can increase the risk of heart disease, according to the NHS include not exercising regularly, having diabetes, and consuming a high-fat diet. Cholesterol contributes to the build-up of plaques in your blood as well.  There are loads of everyday foods we all consume that can contribute to a higher risk of heart disease. Hard cheese, cakes, biscuits, lard, butter, and meat pies are all foods the NHS recommends limiting. It also advises that you should not eat more than six grams of sugar each day – as this can contribute to higher blood pressure.
