The 17-year-old victim suffered the wounds in Navigation Park in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday evening.  A man, aged around 70, was with a dog in the park at the time, police said. Police have now issued an appeal for witnesses and have asked anyone with information about the man or the dog to come forward. A post on the official Greater Manchester Police Trafford South Facebook page last night described the man at the scene as a white male, who was aged about 70 and was around 5ft 9in tall. He was described as being unstable on his feet, Manchester Evening News reports, and was wearing a long, brown leather jacket with a bobble hat. The pensioner also had a walking stick, the appeal added. The dog was described as being mostly white. It looked similar to a Labrador but was thought to have been crossed with another breed and had ginger fur on its back. The canine was also described as being skinny, "fairly young" - around two-years-old - and had a red harness. It is believed the girl has since been discharged from hospital. The incident has provoked a strong reaction on Facebook. Anna Massey said: "Imagine walking off after knowing your dog had injured someone? Completely irresponsible owner." Daniela O'Brien said: "There’s a real increase in this kind of thing. I wonder if it’s connected to all those people who rushed out to buy a dog in lockdown and didn’t bother investing in training. So sad for all involved, including the dogs that so often get put down when it’s largely owner fault." And Natalie Bradley added: "Dogs should be on a lead. Im sick of my dog getting attacked, and owners saying 'sorry my dog is usually fine'. If a dog is on a lead then no other dog, person or child would come to harm."
