 The Portugal star joined United in the summer for a fee of £20million to end a spell of 12 years away from the club. Having been expected to mount a challenge for the title this season, United have faltered massively despite the star's 17 league goals. It is rumoured that Ronaldo will leave in the summer after a chaotic season at Old Trafford, with the star likely to want to play in the Champions League next season. And the Bulgarian has claimed that Ronaldo would not be blamed if he decided on a new venture in search of Europe's premier competition. “Ronaldo is doing incredibly well for his age with the way he plays and the goals he scores,” Berbatov told Betfair. “To have so many Premier League goals in a season at his age is an incredible achievement. He is doing what he needs to do, and that is score goals. “His game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important. If he decides to go, obviously you can not blame him. When you are used to playing Champions League football every year of your career and then you don't have it, it's tough to accept. “His performances this season show how well he is taking care of himself. He will want to play as long as he can and show that the impossible is possible. He has proven that he can still do it at 37 in the Premier League, he likes to prove people wrong and I'm pretty sure that he will want to continue doing that and play a few more years.” United must hope that Arsenal lose all of their last four games in order to even stand a chance of qualifying for the top four, whilst also needing Tottenham to pick up just two points from four. The Red Devils finished second in the Premier League last season, but have failed to hit any sort of heights this season.  Erik ten Hag is set to come in as manager over the summer in a bid to change their fortunes. And he may have to work without Ronaldo if the star chooses to leave.
