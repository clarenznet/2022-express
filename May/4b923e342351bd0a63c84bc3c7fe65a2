Sophia Loren, 87, set pulses racing in a series of stills from her 1964 film Marriage Italian Style. Stunning black and white photographs saw the legendary Hollywood star pose in a sultry see-through nightgown that exposed her underwear. The Italian actress paired the gown, which featured some satin and sequin details, with some heeled sandals. She wore her voluminous locks down, while complementing the alluring look with gold jewellery and her staple smokey eye. Thanks to her performance in Marriage Italian Style, Sophia was nominated for a second Oscar. She had previously won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Cesira in the film Two Women (1961) directed by Vittorio De Sica.
