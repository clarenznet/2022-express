Proposals, set out in the Queen’s Speech, require schools to publish detailed attendance records on a national register, which local authorities can track in real-time to make sure no child is left behind. The new system will also help bring legal interventions against problem parents who face a £60 fine if attendance doesn’t improve, upped to £120 if it isn’t paid in 21 days. While the threat of appearing on a “wanted” list is unlikely to deter persistent offenders already disillusioned with authority, the mass data harvest will reveal the extent of school absences – an issue that has significantly worsened after repeated lockdowns.To blame the drop in school attendance merely on capriciousness or bad behaviour would be to neglect the immense complexity of the matter.For the first time last year, more than one million children were referred to specialist mental health services for help with addiction, anxiety, depression and eating disorders among other conditions.Meanwhile, families up-and-down the country are struggling to put dinner on the table in the cost of living crisis. Food banks report increased demand for meals that do not require cooking because people are worried they won’t be able to afford the gas bill, and a study this week revealed some 2.6 million children are regularly going hungry.This is the heart-breaking reality of 21st century Britain, and it is plain that repeated school absences, child mental health, food insecurity and energy poverty are inextricably linked issues which have a knock-on effect. It will take a joined-up strategy to sort out, and slapping a £60 fine on a cash-strapped parent who can’t afford the weekly shop will only exacerbate the situation. Boris Johnson promised a brighter future in Tuesday’s Queen’s Speech, but the Bank of England has warned the economy is heading for recession, cases of anxiety and depression have doubled in the last two years, with money worries a key factor and with families stretched to breaking point, children will inevitably suffer and their education will take a hit. The Prime Minster is mistaken if he thinks he’s got time on his side. ---------- Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney’s ludicrous Wagatha Christie libel trial got underway this week after three years of legal wrangling.In a finale better suited to an episode of Footballers’ Wives than an Agatha Christie whodunnit, the pair came face to face at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.Coleen, 36, accompanied by former England striker Wayne, 36, arrived with a broken foot in a protective boot and the other in a velvet Gucci loafer.Rebekah, 40, in big sunglasses, was without her husband Leicester City striker Jamie, 35.Foul-mouthed text messages were read out, along with claims Rebekah muscled her way into the paparazzi’s shots at international football games.Coleen’s barrister quoted Rebekah’s lewd comments about singer Peter Andre in a 2004 News of the World article.In another plot twist, Rebekah’s agent’s mobile phone was accidentally lost at sea during a particularly bumpy boat trip off the coast of Scotland, days after a legal request to search it.It all started back in 2019 when Coleen turned amateur sleuth to find out who was leaking stories to the press from her private Instagram account and publicly accused Rebekah. It’s been Wags at War ever since.Judges pleaded for them to settle out of court to save themselves six figure legal bills, but neither side backed down.It’s a lose-lose situation for the revenge-hungry pair, but at least they get the public mud-slinging contest they so desperately crave. ---------- Tech billionaire Elon Musk confirmed plans to reinstate Donald Trump’s Twitter account if he gets his hands on the social media platform.Speaking at the Financial Times Future of the Car summit, the world’s richest man said that banning the former US president was a “morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme” alienating “a large part of the country”.If the rumours are true, Trump is planning to run in the 2024 election, and with his favourite mouthpiece reinstalled it might just get very shouty again. ----------- The Prince of Wales delivered the Queen’s Speech for the first time at the State Opening of Parliament. It was a nerve-wracking, history-defining moment, and Charles, standing in for the 96-year-old Queen, didn’t fluff his lines.It’s almost as if he’s been rehearsing for it his whole life.His solid performance offered a glimpse of the monarchy’s future. Alas, the same can’t be said of his son Prince Harry, who appeared in a painfully unfunny skit to promote his new eco-travel campaign.In it the Duke Of Sussex is ambushed by a “rating agent” while out jogging in New Zealand. The five-minute advert launched a new initiative for Harry’s Travalyst organisation, in which holidaymakers, rather than holidays, are rated for sustainability. Given his penchant for private jets, he’d be lucky to scrape one star.
