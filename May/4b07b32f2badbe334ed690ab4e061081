Amazon Echo users have dozens of special commands that they can try out right now. As part of celebrations for Star Wars day which falls today (May 4), Amazon has released a range of commands based around George Lucas's iconic film series. If you're looking for something to make you smile, you can ask Alexa to talk like iconic Star Wars characters such as Yoda or Chewbacca, or you can even pick the voice assistant's brains on Star Wars trivia. If you're wondering how fast the Millenium Falcon goes, or want to hear a Star Wars quote then you'll be able to draw on Alexa's vast knowledge of the Disney-owned series. Amazon first released Star Wars-themed Alexa commands in 2018, and have continued doing so for each Star Wars day since then.
