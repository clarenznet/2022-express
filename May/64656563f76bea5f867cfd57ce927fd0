GMB commentator Kevin Maguire criticised the Monarch after she was forced to miss the event due to "episodic mobility problems" earlier this week before attending the Royal Windsor Horse Show on Friday. Taking to Twitter, the public figure wrote to his 307,000 followers: "Who else would get away with ringing in sick to miss the year's most important work commitment then two days later go to a horse show". But royal fans hit back pointing out that the Monarch is 96. One user @Graham4Health said: "You can't possibly compare the effort and strain of leading a Parliamentary ceremony with looking at horses for 45 minutes through a car window. Give the 96-year-old Queen a break!!" @CarolRu10493431 added: "She is 96 and can do as she likes, good on her."FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES... FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
