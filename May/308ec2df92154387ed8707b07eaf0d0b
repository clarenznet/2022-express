Emmerdale is one of the nation's favourite soaps, set in the tranquil suburbs of the Yorkshire Dales. But if you tune into the show every night, you'll know that's far from the reality. The seemingly peaceful village is filled with steamy affairs, dramatic deaths and huge plot twists...  If you’ve ever dreamt of stepping into the action yourself, we're here to make that possible. To celebrate the launch of our Emmerdale Newsletter, we're giving one lucky reader the chance to get their hands on an amazing prize bundle... The winner will receive a tour for two to enjoy an unforgettable experience at the Emmerdale outdoor TV set, where you'll have the chance to immerse yourself in the show's iconic settings, including the Woolpack pub. If you're lucky, you might even get time to have a pint there! Just watch out for that pesky Meena, she's bound to be plotting her next killer move. We've also teamed up with Buyagift.co.uk to give the lucky winner a two-night stay close to the Emmerdale tour at Novotel Leeds City Centre with breakfast included, worth £159. The hotel stay is one of a host of short breaks and experiences that Buyagift offers. What are you waiting for? Enter the competition here!

We'll send you the latest spoilers, cast news and storyline straight to your inbox. Interested? Click here to sign up.
