Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews played the couple who fell in love after Maria, then a nun, began tutoring his children. The Von Trapps fled their native Austria in 1938 as the Germans took control and tried to enlist Georg into the German navy.  Prior to this, the aristocrat and First World War naval hero had lost his fortune in the Great Depression and turned the family’s love of singing into a professional act. The Von Trapps resettled in the US for a new life after leaving Austria by train and boat.  They continued their public performances before settling in Stowe, Vermont, and opening a ski chalet following Georg’s death in 1947. Rosmarie became a US citizen in 1951, omitting “von” from her surname. She later became a teacher and missionary for five years in Papua New Guinea with her half-sister Maria. In Stowe, she was known for walking everywhere and pulling her purchases in a wagon or on a cart.  Described as “emotionally sensitive”, she arranged singalongs and knitting circles and owned thrift shops. “Her kindness, generosity and colourful spirit were legendary, and she had a positive impact on countless lives,” her family said following her death.  She died peacefully after spending all day with her loved ones. She is survived by Johannes von Trapp, the youngest of the Von Trapp children and the family’s last living member.
