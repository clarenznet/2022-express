An RAF Grob G 120TP  plane has issued the emergency signal 7700, indicating an emergency situation. The plane appears to now be travelling in circles just outside of Grantham, near the Barkston Heath RAF base. Writing for Flightradar24, Ken Hoke, a Boeing flight captain, explained “squawking” is a way of an aircraft declaring an emergency with traffic control, so they can receive on-the-ground assistance. He said: "If a crew resets their transponder to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700), all air traffic control facilities in the area are immediately alerted that the aircraft has an emergency situation. "It’s up to the crew to let ATC know what the exact situation is. "It may be an aircraft problem, medical issue, or something else.  "In some cases, a crew may not elect to change their transponder to 7700 (it’s not required). "If I’m talking to Chicago Approach and have a problem, I’ll tell them the problem, declare an emergency over the radio and get vectors to land immediately."  The plane, registered as ZM302, is a Grob G 120TP - a small military plane. The two-seater aircraft is designed for use in training, with seats for a trainer and a student. Both military and civil air pilots are trained in the plane. It is not yet clear which the ZM302 was being used for when it issued the emergency signal.
