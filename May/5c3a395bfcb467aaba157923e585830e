Lewis Hamilton’s esteemed F1 record of winning at least one race every season is under threat. The Brit has suffered his worst start to an F1 season since 2009 and has only finished on the podium once so far this season. Since entering the sport in 2007, the Mercedes driver has taken the chequered flag at least once every year. Sadly for all his fans, the seven-time champion has not looked like winning a race so far this campaign, and based on some of his comments after the inaugural Miami GP, that does not look set to change for the time being. "Unfortunately we are at the same speed as we were in the first race,” Hamilton said. "We haven't improved in these five races but I am hopeful, we have to keep trying and keep working hard." It has been over a decade since Hamilton has been racing in the middle of the pack, and he is still making the necessary adjustments having spent the entirety of last season battling Max Verstappen for the world championship. He added: "It's still racing, just a different perspective, a different point of view. JUST IN: Lewis Hamilton had 'jaw and teeth shaking' for duration of Monaco GP as he raises concerns    “That’s what I was saying. I was like ‘let’s go’ when it was just drizzling a little bit at the beginning. We will talk about it in the drivers’ briefing but we should have started the race.” While Hamilton could only muster an eighth pace finish in Monaco on Sunday, teammate George Russell finished fifth and continued his imprsssive start to the campaign. Red Bull's Sergio Perez won his first race of the season, while Carlos Sainz finished second and Max Verstappen came home in third.
