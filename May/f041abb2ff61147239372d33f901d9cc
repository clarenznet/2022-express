Janet Jackson, 55, appeared in great spirits last night as she stepped onto the red carpet at an event. The Escapade singer opted for an all-black outfit for the Barnstable Brown Gala in Kentucky, which was held at the Barnstable-Brown Mansion. She paired her black trousers with a matching turtleneck top and added an oversized coat in the same colour on top. Janet completed the look with some black chunky platform heels and black bangles. The singer chose some large gold hoop earrings to go with the rest of the outfit. She styled her long braids in a high bun, while keeping her makeup simple in earthy and nude tones. The star-studded event included guests such as Larry Birkhead, Ricky Bell and Amy Correa Bell.
