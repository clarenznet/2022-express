Shortly before Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness hit cinemas earlier this month, the first teaser for Thor: Love and Thunder landed. The last time we saw Chris Hemsworth’s Asgardian in the MCU was at the end of Avengers Endgame when he jet off into space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Now the Marvel superhero is on a journey to find himself, before coming across his ex Jane Foster, who is somehow now worthy of his restored hammer Mjölnir as The Mighty Thor. Little has been given away plotwise, with no sign yet of Thor: Love and Thunder villain Gorr the God Butcher. But no doubt Christian Bale’s baddie will show up in the new trailer today. Hemsworth teased the new footage in a special video: “Do not miss it! Spread the word! Spread the love! This trailer is going to blow your mind. It is something that I am so, so proud of. This film is incredible. I cannot wait for the fans to see it. It is the greatest thing I’ve ever had the pleasure and honour of working on and I can’t wait for you to see it.” DON'T MISSAvengers 5 theory: Thor 4 will introduce multiverse Secret Wars Thors [AVENGERS 5]Gladiator 2: Russell Crowe and Chris Hemsworth ‘sharing script ideas’ [GLADIATOR 2]Thor Love and Thunder theory: Multiverse remake of Thor The Dark World [THOR 4] The new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer will debut tonight during Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics.
