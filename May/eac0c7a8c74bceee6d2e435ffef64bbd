Vladimir Putin, who has bogged down his country in a gruelling war in Ukraine, has reportedly resorted to going everywhere with the triggers for Russia's nuclear weapons. Reports in the UK press point to a recent attempt on the Russian leader's life which has led Putin to carry a suitcase containing the Kremlin's nuclear launch codes. On Tuesday, Jeremy Vine discussed Putin's reported nuclear paranoia with his panel. "The president of the Russian Federation decides it all," said Zelensky through an interpreter. "If we are talking about ending this war without him personally, that decision cannot be taken." Zelensky said the discovery of mass killings in areas occupied by Russian troops earlier in the war, particularly outside Kyiv, made it more difficult to arrange talks and he would rule out any discussions with other officials. I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president," he said. "And only in the case when there is one issue on the (table): stopping the war. There are no other grounds for any other kind of meeting." Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have held sporadic talks since Russian forces poured into Ukraine at the end of February, but both sides say the talks have stalled.

In his remarks to the audience in Davos, Zelenskiy also said that war came at a huge human price for Ukrainians. The country's forces, he said, were making gains, notably near the second city of Kharkiv, but "the bloodiest situation remains in Donbas, where we are losing too many people". He added that any notion of recovering by force the Crimea peninsula, seized and annexed by Russia in 2014, would cause hundreds of thousands of casualties.
