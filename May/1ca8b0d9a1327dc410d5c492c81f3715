Taking to Reddit, the user claimed her neighbours are getting angry at her for no reason - just because she parks in the middle of both spaces. The woman explained how the flat she lives in with her husband has an underground car park and although the couple only have one car the rent includes two parking spaces.  To begin with she only ever parked in one of her designated spaces, but as the car park is "quite tight" she found it difficult to get her car out if someone parked alongside her. Now, the woman and her partner have decided to make use of their two spaces and park their car in the middle - blocking other drivers from parking in either space, reports The Mirror. Her post said: "My husband and I live in an apartment complex which has underground parking. As part of our rent, we pay for two parking spaces, but we only have one car. "The parking area underneath the block is quite tight and one of our spots is next to a corner wall, but when someone parks in the next corner wall it overlaps our spot. This means it’s quite hard to get our car in and out sometimes. "Recently people have been parking in our second spot and we’ve had to leave notes to politely ask people not to do this. "To counter this, my husband has begun parking across both our spaces (in the middle of our spaces essentially) but the other day someone left us a rude note saying we shouldn’t park like this. "[Am I wrong] for using both my car spaces when I only have one car? Our neighbours might think we are s****y for using both with one car - but it’s s*****er of them to park in our spot!" Most people sided with the woman in the comments, saying that as she pays for the spaces she is entitled to use them however she wants - even parking in the middle of them both. One person said: "It’s your parking spot. No, you are not an a**hole for using parking spots you pay for." While another added: "They're your spots, that you pay for. You can park however you please."
