The Premium Bonds results have been released today, revealing two new millionaires in Manchester and Wandsworth. One of the winning bonds had been purchased all the way back in 2003, giving hope to older bond holders that their day may be coming soon. Two lucky Britons went to sleep last night with normal bank accounts but have awoken this morning to seven figure winnings. The first winning bond number is 281HY160082 belonging to a winner in Greater Manchester. The second jackpot number is 092QC393406, purchased in June 2003 by a bondholder in Wandsworth. Both accounts held relatively high sums close to the Premium Bonds limit, with £50,000 and £49,000 respectively.  The Greater Manchester winner has £50,000 in Premium Bonds. They purchased the winning Bond, which has a value of £40,000, in September 2016. It is well-known that having more money in Premium Bonds increases one’s chances of winnings, but there is hope for those with lower savings. The Wandsworth winner managed to capture the elusive £1million jackpot with a winning bond with the value of £1,000. Alongside the lucky millionaires, 3.4 million other prizes are due to be dished out this month. These prizes could be worth between £25 and £100,000. All combined, NS&I will be paying out £98,183,175 in prizes this month. Six bond holders will be waking up this morning having won £100,000. One West Scotland bond holder has won £50,000 with a bond that has a value of £200. They hold a total of £23,125 in Premium Bonds.   Each bond purchased is allocated a unique bond number for every £1 invested. Every month, winning bond numbers are pulled randomly by ERNIE, NS&I’s Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment. Britons can check if they are one of the lucky winners this month using NS&I’s prize checker from Wednesday May 4. This can be found on their website or their official prize checker app.  Bond holders will need their Premium Bonds holder number to use the website and their NS&I number or holder’s number to use the app. By doing this people can also check if they have any unclaimed prizes owed to them. There is an estimated £74million left unclaimed in prizes and there is no time limit in which to claim it as the money is kept indefinitely. The first prize draw was held in June 1957, since then a total of £22.9billion has been handed out in prizes.
