Eva Longoria, 47, ensured all eyes were on her as she stunned on the red carpet for the film premiere of Top Gun Maverick. The former Desperate Housewives actress has sported a variety of jaw-dropping looks on the second day of the Cannes Film Festival and the on-screen star didn't disappoint. Working her best angles, Eva stunned in a dazzling metallic dress that hugged her slender curves as the beauty posed for pictures. The off-the-shoulder number featured a plunging neckline which gave a glimpse of her cleavage. The floor-length gown featured a thigh-high split at the back of the dress which she teamed with towering heels. Eva's brunette tresses were pulled up into a high ponytail and she accessorised her looks with a pair of diamond earrings. She rocked heavy makeup sporting a dark smokey eye and a light blush to accentuate her stunning features. Eva was in good company as a host of famous faces stepped out to celebrate the new film with co-stars Tom Cruise and Jennifer Connelly all in attendance.
