The £150 council tax rebate was announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak back in February to help people through the cost of living crisis. However, some people are still desperately waiting for the money which they need to pay energy bills. All households in council tax bands A to D are due to receive a £150 council tax rebate from the Government this year to help them pay their energy bills. Some 80 percent of people live in bands A to D and qualify for the rebate. Residents in areas including Sunderland, Leeds and Manchester have already received their £150 council tax rebate. North Northamptonshire Council, Torbay and Braintree council residents should have also received their rebates by now to help ease the cost of living.

More councils have confirmed they will be paying out this month with people who pay by direct debit receiving the money first. Anyone who doesn’t pay by direct debit might have to wait for a cheque but should go onto their local council website to find out. Councils have until September to issue the refunds but many people will be hoping they receive the money much sooner.

While households who fall into bands E, F, G and H won’t be automatically eligible for the £150 council tax rebate, they can apply for help. All councils have a discretionary Household Support Fund to help local residents who are struggling. A warning has also been issued to anyone who is in their overdraft to take steps to ensure their rebate is not swallowed up. The National Debt website has a sample letter for households to use if they wish to exercise their right of appropriation. What is happening where you live?
