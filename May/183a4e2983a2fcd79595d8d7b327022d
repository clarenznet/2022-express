Whether an EA deal ends up going through remains to be seen. Puck reported that EA has held a number of talks in recent years, and have become more emboldened to agree on a sale since Microsoft's mega-money deal to acquire Activision Blizzard was announced. If EA ends up getting acquired by Apple then it will almost be like the gaming giant is going back to its roots. Apple, funnily enough, has a big link to EA - with the gaming giant originally founded in 1982 by Trip Hawkins. Hawkins was Apple's director of strategy and marketing and left the Mac makers to found EA.
