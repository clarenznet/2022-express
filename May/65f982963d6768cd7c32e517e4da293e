Anne Hathaway, 39, looked the image of beauty as she took to the red carpet this evening in France. The actress stunned in a white ensemble which featured a bandeau top, arm detailing forming a bow on her back and a floor length skirt. This bow fell to the floor, leaving a trail element to her chosen outfit. At closer look of the co-ord, Anne stood out as her ensemble featured bejewelled white sequins. Anne looked youthful as she opted for minimal makeup, with her signature brown tresses styled in a light wave. She accessorised with a large silver chain necklace that featured a giant blue emerald, along with a matching ring. Others at the premiere included Julia Roberts who also stars in the coming-of-age film. She looked nothing short of sensational in a black Louis Vuitton jumpsuit and jewelry as she flashed a wide grin for the cameras. The American period drama film is described as a coming-of-age story about growing up in Queens in the 1980s. It will be centred on the filmmaker's experience at the Kew-Forest School in Queens, New York, where former president Donald Trump was an alumnus.
