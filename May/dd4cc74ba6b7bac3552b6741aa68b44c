The aircraft sent out a squawk code, which is used to provide effective communication between air traffic control and aircraft. 7700 is the most well known of these codes and it is used to indicate an emergency. The nature of the emergency is still unclear. According to radarbox.com, the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker took off from the RAF Mildenhall air station in Holywell Row, UK, at 05:36 am today (Wednesday). The initial destination is not known. The aircraft appears to have flown to Romania, almost reaching Bucharest before circling above Brasov. There, the aircraft turned around and flew back to the UK to return to where it took off from.  At 4pm it squawked the emergency code 7700. Tracking data end at 4.30 pm, with the aircraft appearing at 625 ft just above Lakenheath. A Twitter account tracking air traffic claimed that during the flight, the aircraft had to shut down one engine. Declaring an emergency during a flight means the crew determines they have an 'urgency' or 'distress' situation. Explaining the emergency codes in aviation, pilot Ken Hoke said the crew requests "timely (but not necessarily immediate) assistance". In an interview with flightradar24.com, he said: "A 'distress' condition means that the flight is in serious and/or imminent danger and requires immediate assistance." And added: "If a crew resets their transponder to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700), all air traffic control facilities in the area are immediately alerted that the aircraft has an emergency situation. "Itâ€™s up to the crew to let ATC know what the exact situation is. "It may be an aircraft problem, medical issue, or something else."
