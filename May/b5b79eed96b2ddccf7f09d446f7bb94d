Many of the world's media outlets will maintain a heavy presence around the likes of Buckingham Palace and St Paul's Cathedral in central London, where many Jubilee events are scheduled over the long weekend. But for a number of the celebrations, camera crews require express permission to film the Royal Family during these official events.  But the streaming giant, which has signed a deal with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and is thought to have a second documentary about the royals in the works, will not count itself among that number, according to the Telegraph. A source has claimed that, should Netflix camera crews try to set up filming positions in public areas, they will be "moved on" by services running the events.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously traveled with a Netflix camera crew during their trip to the Hague last month. The couple visited the Netherlands for the Invictus Games, championed by Prince Harry, with cameras in tow for their upcoming documentary series, 'Heart of Invictus'.  The production wing of the couple's Archewell brand, Archewell Productions, described the series' aim to "showcase powerful stories of resilience and hope from competitors on their journey" to the Hague. The pair signed a deal with Netflix worth $100 million back in 2020, but have yet to produce any finished content. There had been question marks over whether Prince Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, would make the trip back across the Atlantic for the Jubilee. Three-year-old Archie and Lilibet, who will turn one during the extended weekend, will be part of the celebrations along with their parents.  It will mark their first official visit back to the UK as a family since they stepped back from royal duties in March 2020. A spokesperson for the couple said they were “excited and honoured” to return to UK turf for the festivities. MORE TO FOLLOW...
