Madonna seems keen to prove that she's still got what it takes to shock the world at the age of 63, despite her Instagram ban - and she displayed her age-defying looks in London to prove it. She paraded her signature sense of style in a daring leather jacket, complete with punk-style studs, and matching leather fingerless gloves with crucifixes attached to them. Beneath the jacket, the Frozen singer wore a long black gothic-style dress, while she'd braided her hair into long blonde pigtails. She also amped up the look with an abundance of sparkly jewellery, from crystallised hair clips and necklaces, to a pair of eye-catching crucifix earrings. Earlier, after learning that she had been blocked on picture sharing app Instagram, she had joked that she'd "never worn so many clothes in my life!" The star's risqu√© social media content has increased over the past few months, leading to other celebrities weighing in on her revealing looks. These included a disapproving Piers Morgan, and rapper 50 Cent, who Madonna later claimed had been "pretending" to be her friend before insulting her looks. Now that it seems her live updates have been blocked, she chose to spend her time a little differently, attending a private members' club in London with FKA Twigs. Madonna had also made an appearance with the British singer at a fashion graduate catwalk show earlier in the evening - and, Instagram ban or not, the world surely hasn't seen the last of the Vogue hitmaker's provocative antics.
