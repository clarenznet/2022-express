Ms Truss is hoping to rip up parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol to unilaterally remove the need for checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. She feels that the long-running negotiations with the EU have reached the end of a long impasse and nothing more can be done. Mr Sefcovic said that with "political will" and "genuine commitment" joint solutions to issues raised concerning the protocol can be found. But a Number 10 spokesman said: “We are working extremely hard to find real solutions to this. But what is clear is that the EU’s proposals as they stand do not fix the underlying problems with the Protocol. In some cases they make things worse.” Sources told The Telegraph that a decision would be taken as early as Monday on whether to give ministers powers to override large parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal.
