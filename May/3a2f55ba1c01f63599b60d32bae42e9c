Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will return to the UK for the Platinum Jubilee. The couple traded in their lives as working royals for the US in March 2020 and have rarely returned to the UK since then. Their upcoming visit will see them support the Queen as she celebrates her 70th year on the throne, but their presence may come as an unwelcome surprise for many Britons. Polls show they are amongst the least popular royals, with Prince Harry and his wife on ratings of 32 percent and 24 percent, respectively, according to YouGov. The monarchy's supporters have not forgiven their revealing statements, many of which have portrayed the Firm in a negative light. So do you think the Queen should welcome Harry and Meghan back to the UK? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
