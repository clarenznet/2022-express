Uma Thurman, 52, and her daughter Maya Hawke, 23, looked phenomenal as they walked around the set of their new movie, The Kill Room. The Kill Bill star showcased her ageless looks in very minimal makeup, as she was joined by her daughter, who has been following in her mum's footsteps as a famous actress. Uma, who sported a totally smooth visage, could be seen wearing a black maxi dress paired with matching flat shoes and a chunky gold necklace. A stark contrast could be observed in Maya, who opted for a colourful, long-sleeved blouse and wide leg jeans. Uma could be seen carrying what appeared to be a script, or some notes, while on the Hoboken, New Jersey set. The upcoming title will see her sharing the screen once again with Pulp Fiction star Samuel L Jackson. Maya, who is also an actress, is the older of two children born to actors Ethan Hawke and Uma. She made her on-screen debut as Jo March in the 2017 BBC adaptation of Little Women and later went on to star in Netflix’s Stranger Things.
