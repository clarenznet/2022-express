In a "humble address" to the Queen, Mr Johnson expressed hope the nation would come together to reciprocate the "love, devotion and leadership" she had shown it. He added: "No monarch, by her efforts, dedication and achievement, better deserves the attribute of greatness. For me, she is already Elizabeth the Great." Mr Johnson acknowledged the joyous milestone would be "tinged with sadness" without her beloved husband Prince Philip by her side. The PM added: "I hope we can further comfort and reassure her. And with every bonfire, concert, street party and aerobatic display, reciprocate the love, devotion and leadership she has shown the country over seven decades."  Mr Johnson said Prime Ministers are not supposed to relay conversations with the Queen. But he added: "Her knowledge of politics and world affairs is profound. There have been times I've been scrabbling to remember a date or the name of some African capital and she's got there first. "And when it comes to anything equestrian, I'm simply nowhere."  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Queen was "the personification of our nation's great history."
