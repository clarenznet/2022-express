Army intelligence troops captured by the Ukrainians have spoken out about this brutality in a video clip made by Ukrainian journalist Volodymyr Zolkin. In the video clip, one of the soldiers said commanders "finished off" their wounded. Asked by Mr Zolkin what this meant, the soldier said: "Just like thatâ€¦a wounded soldier is lying on the ground, and a battalion's commander shoots him dead from a gun." This comes as victorious Ukrainian troops pose at the border after pushing Russian forces out of the city of Kharkiv. In footage posted online on Monday by the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov soldiers planted a border marker painted in the Ukrainian flag colours somewhere along the frontier. One of the soldiers in the video said: "Today the 15th May, Kharkiv's territorial defence forces of Ukraine - 227th battalion, 127th brigade - went to the border that marks the split between the Russian Federation - the occupiers - and Ukraine. We are here". FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
