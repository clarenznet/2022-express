Squirrels are much more present in spring and summer. Their emergence from hibernation around this time coincides with mating season, giving them a population boost. While they won't cause much trouble for most people, gardeners may find it tough to outwit the rodents when they embark on a feeding frenzy. Squirrels spend most of their time tearing through the trees, where they are little concern for anyone except the odd cat and dog. They occasionally descend in search of food, and well-cultivated gardens are a rich source of their favourites. When they do, they are relatively straightforward to spot, as the animals leave telling signs of their presence.

They specifically favour maples, beech, sycamore and ash varieties. Some gardeners will use animal repellants in their gardens for cats and foxes, and they often prove effective. Like those animals, squirrels have sensitive noses and an aversion to stronger scents. They react most to deer repellant, coffee grounds or dog hair concealed under plants. These are ultimately shorter-term solutions, as rain will wash many of these away. Those with more money can invest in higher-tech alternatives that last for longer. Motion-activated sprinklers and air cans that detect their presence usually shock them enough to shoo them away. Otherwise, experts recommended using mulch, which squirrels do not like feeling under their feet.
