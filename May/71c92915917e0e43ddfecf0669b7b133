Helen Mirren, 76, looked dramatically different today on the red carpet at Cannes Film Festival. The actress looked carefree and happy as she danced around with her On the Edge co-star Andie MacDowell. They were attending the premiere for the film Mother and Son together, with both acting legends looking utterly radiant. Helen wore a silver embellished dress with long floaty sleeves, which she paired with some black court shoes. She opted for a very different look to usual, with heavy, dark makeup framing her eyes, and winged eyeliner giving her a trendy catlike appearance. Her silver hair was pulled back into a sleek half up â€˜do, with long, luscious extensions trailing all the way down her back. Elegant diamonds adorned her ears, while her silver nail polish accentuated her metallic theme. She was celebrating the 75th Cannes Film Festival at the glitzy Palais des Festivals.
