Sony is getting ready to announce the next batch of free PS4 and PS5 PlayStation Plus games for June 2022. PlayStation Plus games launch on the first Tuesday of the month. The announcement takes place on the preceding Wednesday. Unfortunately, due to the way the dates fall, this means the June 2022 PS Plus releases will be announced at 4.30pm BST on June 1, before launching for subscribers on the morning of June 7. Of course, with Sony about to introduce its new PlayStation Plus tier system, there is a chance we could get an irregular announcement for June 2022. According to Sony, the new look PS Plus will be made up of three different tiers. PlayStation Plus Essential offers the same benefits as the current system. This includes the ability to play online multiplayer, free PS4 and PS5 games on a monthly basis, plus exclusive discounts and cloud saves. Priced at £83.99 for the entire year, PlayStation Plus Extra includes all of the Essential benefits, as well as access to PS4 and PS5 games (similar to PlayStation Now). Finally, priced at £99.99 for the year, PlayStation Plus Premium adds PSOne, PS2 and PSP classics, as well as cloud streamed PS3 games, and free game trials. Sony explains more: "The new PlayStation Plus will launch with 700* titles across three membership plans. "The curated content will include blockbuster hits such as Demon’s Souls, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, NBA 2K 22, Red Dead Redemption 2, Returnal, and more." Existing PS Plus and PS Now subscribers will be shifted over to one of the new tiers depending on membership type. If you're a PS Plus subscriber, you'll move to PS Plus Essential. PS Now subscribers, on the other hand, will gain access to PlayStation Plus Premium, with no increase to the price at launch. Sony is hopeful of a June 13 launch in North America, followed by a June 23 release in the UK and Europe.
