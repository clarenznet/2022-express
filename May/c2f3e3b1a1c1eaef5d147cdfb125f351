And I have to tell you that its hardworking Conservative councillors and councils across the country who deliver better local services while managing taxpayers’ money wisely. Not only do Conservative councils on average fix four times as many pestilent potholes as Labour councils, they recycle more of your rubbish than Labour too. And its Conservatives who have been supporting our high streets and small businesses as we bounce back from Covid.  It’s Conservative councils who charge the lowest council tax anywhere in the country, on top of our £150 council tax rebate for over 20 million households this month. Whereas in my old stomping ground of London, the poor residents of Kingston are being charged the highest council tax in the capital by the profligate Lib Dems. And pity the good people of Croydon, where Labour have bankrupted the council, or Hammersmith, who’s Labour council spent tens of thousands of taxpayers money on EU flags and ‘proud members of the EU’ banners - three years after we voted to Leave. The choice on 5 May is clear. Labour and Lib Dems who fritter away your council tax on deciding which statues to tear down or Conservatives, delivering value for money and delivering on your local priorities.
