Aimed at bolstering the bank holiday celebrations, Michell casts an impressionistic eye over the Queen’s long life of public service. There’s no narration and no new material, just archive footage cut to pop music. Michell is seemingly inspired by Asif Kapadia’s documentaries about Ayrton Senna and Amy Winehouse. But Kapadia had mountains of personal recordings and behind-the-scenes footage to offer fresh perspectives on his icons. The closest we get to an unguarded moment here is a clip of Her Majesty looking thrilled when one of her horses wins a race. A lackey hands her a £10 note from a bookie, and the fact that the note has her own face on it makes the moment feel as surreal as the arcane rituals that surround more formal events. Some balance is provided by a section titled Horribilis which remembers the furore over her initial silence after the death of Princess Diana and shows a brief clip of Prince Andrew claiming to be unable to sweat. But the main impression here is of a dignified, if somewhat inscrutable, monarch who has dutifully waved her way through 70 tumultuous years.
