The family has honoured the girl’s birthdays since she was snatched from a holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007 when she was just three. It remains unclear if the prime ­suspect for Madeleine’s disappearance will ever be charged. Christian Brueckner, 45, is in jail in Germany for raping a woman and prosecutors there believe he is responsible for her kidnap and murder. But Brueckner strenuously denies being involved and the authorities in Germany admit they do not have enough evidence to charge him. Yesterday, doctors Kate and Gerry gathered token presents and cards from family members and well wishers. The couple have never given up hope that Madeleine is still alive and pray they will one day be reunited. Her pink bedroom at home in Rothley, Leics, became a shrine to the girl. But it is unclear how it is now being used. As Gerry has said: “Soon there will be the practical issue of what to do with a ‘spare’ room one of the twins may need.” A source close to the family said: “It is a difficult time for them but they will remember Madeleine with a quiet celebration behind closed doors. There will be gifts, prayers, cake, fond memories and above all hope.” Last week, family and friends gathered in their village to mark the 15th anniversary of the disappearance. Her great uncle Brian Kennedy, 83, said 19 “is an age we never thought was possible for her to reach without still knowing what had happened”. She vanished in Praia da Luz just nine days before her fourth birthday. Cardiologist Gerry, 53, and ­hospital medic Kate, 54, told of their need for “closure” in an anniversary message. They said: “Regardless of outcome, Madeleine will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed.” Brueckner is serving seven years for a rape in Praia da Luz, two years before Madeleine vanished. Police say he was in the area when Madeleine was snatched.
