  Caroline was sure to turn heads at the prestigious event with her incredible floor-length gown. The garment featured off-the-shoulder sleeves that were decorated with grey feathering. The bodice of the dress featured a low v-neck and was embroidered with sparkling grey leaves. With only a small rectangular piece of fabric to cover up her front and behind, the star risked a wardrobe malfunction with her skirt.  The gown’s skirt was made out of a see-through, mesh material decorated with sparkling beads. The fabric showed off the presenter’s long legs and the white platform heels she wore on her feet. Caroline wore beautiful gold and turquoise drop-down earrings, which matched another ring on her right hand. The star wore her long hair pinned back and sported some shimmering eyeshadow framed by perfectly-winged eyeliner.
