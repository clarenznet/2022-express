Carol Vorderman, 61, showed off her curves as she slipped into a white jumpsuit while getting ready to see Ed Sheeran in concert. The former Countdown star took to Instagram last night to share some pictures before heading out. She paired her white jumpsuit with a matching jumper that featured a minimal black pattern. Carol also matched her all-white outfit to her nails, but opted for her staple smokey eye and wore her blonde tresses in defined waves. Two of the three selfies were taken in the mirror, while a third selfie showed the TV star giving the camera a sultry look. She captioned the carousel: “On our way to see Ed Sheeran @teddysphotos at @principalitysta ...should be a lively one...I'm naughty @wynneevans plus one. Lord help us all. “Wearing @donnaida....so stretchy and comfy...ready to dance… #concert”
