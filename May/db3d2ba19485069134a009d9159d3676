Other Mrs Hinch fans recommended using white vinegar. Milly Kennerson said: “I use soda crystals of white vinegar.” Ebony Evans wrote: “I take out the drawer and use a sponge.

It can dissolve hard water and cut through grime, making it ideal for washing machine drawers. What’s more, it can be purchased for as little as 29p from supermarkets.
