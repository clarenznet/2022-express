Princess Diana's nieces Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia Spencer caused jaws to drop as they appeared on the red carpet in Cannes on Wednesday. The twins, both 29, looked stunning as they attended the premiere of Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Val Kilmer and Jennifer Connelly. They both wore floor-length gowns as they joined the A-list cast members at the film's premiere. Lady Amelia wore an elegant black one-shoulder dress with chiffon detailing. She wore her hair in a sleek style and opted for a minimal makeup look. Lady Eliza wore a heavily embellished black halterneck number. They both accessorised their glamourous looks with statement earrings. Lady Eliza and Amelia are the daughters of Princess Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer. They share a sister, Kitty, and a brother, Louis Spencer.
