The 19-year-old was rushed to Son Espases hospital in Spain's Palma, Mallorca, after the incident at a beach club in Magaluf. Police rushed to the scene in the early hours of Tuesday morning at 1.25am after the young man dived into the pool, which was barely half a metre deep, at Oceans Beach Club.  His condition has been described as ”serious”. Agents of the Civil Guard have launched an investigation. This comes after a British man died when he fell from a seventh floor balcony in Magaluf. Meanwhile, Spain has launched a crackdown on tourists. Recently, Spain imposed a new rule banning all-inclusive alcohol in the most popular holiday spots, including Majorca and Ibiza. The legislation bans happy hours, pub crawls and two-for-one drinks, as well as the sale of alcohol in shops between 9.30pm and 8am, and forbids the advertising of party boats in designated areas.
