Residents in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, were stunned by the blast, which happened at around 10.10pm yesterday. Police have since discovered a "viable device" which they made safe. They are yet to reveal the nature of the device. No arrests have been made and no one was injured, police told Manchester Evening News. But officers have carried out a fingertip search on back streets in Farnworth, part of Bolton, as they continue to probe the explosion. Tactical aid officers have been deployed to assist the operation. The force is now appealing for new intelligence. Detective Inspector Sarah Bell, of GMP's Bolton CID, said: "The EOD (Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal) attended and made the device safe but confirmed it was a viable device. "We are appealing for information, in particular can we ask that members of the public check CCTV and dashcam footage on Longcauseway and Moorhead Close. "Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 5830 quoting incident 3194 of 01/05/2022. "Information can also be reported online or by using the LiveChat function at www.gmp.police.uk. If you can't report online, call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Residents shared their initial concern. A pensioner, who lives on the estate, said: Finding out it was an explosion is very frightening, especially so close to a petrol station.” One Facebook user wrote: "They’re doing door to door enquiries so it must be something (serious)."
