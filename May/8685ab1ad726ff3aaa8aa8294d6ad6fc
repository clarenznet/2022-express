And although the weather is set to become unsettled, the beauty of the famous Rydal Caves in the Lake District – a location for Netflix hit The Witcher – proved a tantalising taster of the heatwave predicted to land next week. Those making the most of the balmy spring conditions yesterday included 10-month-old Aidan Robert, who delighted in a field of buttercups in Colerne, Wilts. A paddle boarder was snapped strolling on sun-drenched Roker Beach in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, while a woman and her dog soaked up the rays in London’s Hyde Park, right. They were wise to make the most of it. Breezy and showery weather looks set to take hold from today. Richard Miles of the Met Office said: “Most of the country can expect unsettled weather over the next few days, with showers and cooler temperatures for many.” The mercury is not expected to creep above 68F again until the weekend. But what comes next will be worth the brief wait as May’s “warming trend” is set to become a “searing blast” from Italy and the south of France. Temperatures could soar to more than 80F (27C) later in the month, in what could be one of the hottest May spells since the 1920s. Jim Dale of British Weather Services said: “Very warm weather will start to come in from the South East through the latter part of the week. Next weekend is shaping up to be the warmest of the year so far. “We will start to see the real heat pick up as warm air comes in across the Continent from the south of France and Italy. This is the result of high pressure which will pick up a continental airflow and it keeps the warm air over us into the middle of May.” The South is due a heatwave headstart, with Jim adding: “Scotland and northern England will take longer to catch up.”
