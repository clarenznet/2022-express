The Emergency Information and Coordination Center (CICU) were called on Wednesday evening at around 6.15pm local time. A 19-month-old boy had fallen into the water in a private pool in Aigües and had been pulled out unconscious. An air ambulance based in the province and a Basic Life Support unit rushed to the scene. A neighbour began basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres until the emergency services had arrived. Once there, the air ambulance paramedics continued with advanced CPR and other recovery techniques, but tragically there was no response. The youngster was then pronounced dead by the ambulance service. It is not yet clear if the 19-month-old boy was on holiday with his family or lived in Spain. A spokesman for a regional government emergency response coordination centre said: "At 6.15pm on Wednesday, we were informed a little boy had been pulled out of a private swimming pool in Aigues. "We mobilised an air ambulance and a basic life support ambulance. "A neighbour performed resuscitation techniques until the medical response teams arrived. "Once they were there, the medical responders continued with advanced CPR and other resuscitation techniques but they were unable to save the child, a 19-month-old toddler who was pronounced dead at the scene."
