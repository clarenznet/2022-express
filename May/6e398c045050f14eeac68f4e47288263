Caylee Cowan, 24, stunned as she posed alongside her boyfriend Casey Affleck, 46, at the Cannes Film Festival last night. The pair have been dating since January last year, four years after he split from his first wife, Summer Phoenix. Caylee put on a very busty display as she posed with her partner, with the pair not leaving each other's side as they took to the red carpet. She showed off her ample assets in the red, corset style gown, which showed off her killer curves. The stunning design split into a ruffled skirt at the star's waistline, with the trail following behind her. Caylee styled her short dark tresses in a light wave, and accessorised with silver dangle earrings. She went for a simple makeup look with a bold red lip, matching her sultry red gown. Meanwhile, Casey sported a suit and bow tie as he posed alongside his youthful partner. The couple arrived at Cannes for the premiere of Three Thousand Years Of Longing (Trois Mille Ans A Tâ€™Attendre). The pair have been dating for over a year, with Casey previously being married to Summer Phoenix. They began dating in 2000 after being introduced by her brother Joaquin Phoenix and married in 2006. The former couple share two sons and their divorce was finalised in 2017, citing "irreconcilable differences".
