Thanks to the upcoming Platinum Jubilee, there are several incoming bank holidays. The next one is the spring bank holiday on June 2, which was moved from May this year.

Unfortunately, after that spring bank holiday has passed, there are only three more in 2022. The remaining bank holidays of 2022 include: The Boxing Day bank holiday falls on December 26, a Monday this year, while Christmas Day is substituted for December 27 as the occasion falls on a Sunday.
