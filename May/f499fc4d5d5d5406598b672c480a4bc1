The Russian military analyst, called Andrey Shipilov, posted in his Telegram channel, "in the Russian army, in any case, in those parts that are on the territory of Russia, a mass strike of the middle command level began. And above all staff. All work is sabotaged, all orders from superiors are put on brakes." The news comes after an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched an astonishing threat at the United Kingdom. One of Putin's propaganda mouthpieces has warned the UK that Moscow could "sink it forever" with a Sarmat ICBM or a 100-megaton missile. Speaking on Russian state TV, the presenter said such an attack would spark a tsunami and turn Britain into a "radioactive wasteland". “One launch, Boris, and there’ll be no Britain,” he added. Despite the hysteria, Host Dmitry Kiselev went on to say: "We don’t want such a development... Russia definitely isn’t planning to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine…let’s calm down." BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg suggested this exchange was another attempt by the Kremlin to demonise the West in the eyes of the Russian public. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
