Fortnite is once again playable on Apple's iPhone range, and it's thanks to Xbox. In some surprise news today it's been revealed that Fortnite is playable on Apple devices such as an iPhone or iPad, as well as Android phones and tablets via the cloud. Xbox has teamed up with Epic Games to release this feature in dozens of countries today, and all you need is a Microsoft account as well internet access on an eligible device. Today's surprise news comes almost two years after Fortnite was removed from the Apple App Store amid a dispute over payments. In August 2020 Fortnite was taken off the Apple App Store with the Google Play Store also making the same move. Android fans, however, were able to download from a separate Epic Games website page, but Apple fans were out of luck. Since then the latest version of Fortnite hasn't been playable on Apple devices.  Announcing the news in a blog post, Catherine Gluckstein, VP and Head of Product for Xbox Cloud Gaming, said: "As part of our mission to bring the joy and community of gaming to players wherever they are and to make gaming more accessible to people around the world, I’m excited to announce that we’ve partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available on supported browser-enabled devices for free with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) in 26 countries. "This means, starting today, if you love Fortnite you only need two things to play in cloud-supported markets: a Microsoft account, an iOS, iPadOS, Android phone or tablet, or Windows PC with internet access. "With no installation or memberships required, all you need to do is go to Xbox.com/play on your web browser and sign-in with your Microsoft Account to party-up with friends or earn your next Victory Royale in Fortnite. "Whether you want to play Fortnite with native touch controls or a supported controller, it’s easy to jump into Fortnite with Xbox Cloud Gaming."
