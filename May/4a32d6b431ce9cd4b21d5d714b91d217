The Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon admitted on Saturday that he watched pornography twice in Parliament. He said the first time was accidental after looking at a tractor website, but admitted that the second time was deliberate. Mr Parish was suspended by the Conservative Party on Friday over the allegations. The 65-year-old confirmed he intended to quit over the weekend but the move has only now been made official.  The MP, who has represented Tiverton and Devon since 2010, said it had been a “moment of madness”. Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Mr Parish said: “The situation was that funnily enough, it was tractors I was looking at. “I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done.   “But my crime - biggest crime - is that on another occasion I went in a second time.” He admitted that the second time had been deliberate and that it had happened in the House of Commons while he was sitting waiting to vote. He said what he did was "absolutely totally wrong" and announced he would be resigning after recognising the “furore” and “damage” he was causing his family and constituency. He added: “I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. I made a huge terrible mistake and I'm here to tell the world.” Asked about why he decided to watch the material in the Commons, Mr Parish said he did not know, adding that he must have “taken complete leave of my senses” and “sense of decency”.   Instead, MPs who wish to resign must ask the Chancellor to appoint them to a historic “office of profit”. The role disbars them from sitting in the Commons. The announcement will mean a by-election for the MP’s seat of Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, though no date has yet been set. It had been held since 2010 by Mr Parish, who enjoyed a majority of more than 24,000 in the 2019 general election.
