Broadband customers looking to save on their Virgin Media, Sky or BT bill need to know about a handy trick that can save them over £100. If you're reaching the end of your broadband contract and are faced with a choice of renewing or moving to a different provider then you should really check out money-saving website TopCashback. The online service - which helps users save at thousands of different online stores in the UK - offers cashback of up to £200 when customers sign up for broadband. Cashback can be earned at a variety of leading broadband providers such as Virgin Media, BT and Sky as well as at other big names like EE, Plusnet, TalkTalk, NOW broadband, Shell Energy and more. For those of you who haven't heard of TopCashback before, you may be wondering if this is too good to be true - but it isn't! TopCashback partners with thousands of UK retailers and storefronts and receives commission for directing its users to these websites. And, very generously, TopCashback says it passes on "100 percent" of the commission it earns to customers. To start earning cashback, you will first of all have to sign up as a new TopCashback member.  Then, you will need to head to the TopCashback website and find the dedicated hub page for the online store or product type you're after. On this page, there will be a Get Cashback button that you can click on. Simply select that and you'll be directed to the retailer or service provider's official storefront. Complete your order and then your TopCashback account will be topped up with any cashback you've earned. You will then be able to withdraw this money on the TopCashback website either by moving it to your PayPal account, via a BACS transfer or by topping up a range of giftcards.
