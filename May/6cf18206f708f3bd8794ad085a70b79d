The former Oasis guitarist was stalked for several years - and she tried to break into his hotel bedroom once. Noel, 54, began to spot her at the front of all his solo concerts where "she does all these suggestive hand movements, it's all weird, all this 'Come to me' sex stuff". He said: "I've never seen her in the UK... and she's still active. "I have spoken to her but I didn't realise she was a stalker at that point. I was signing things for fans after a gig and I spoke to her. "Then I noticed her at the next gig and then the gig after that and then she started trying to get backstage. The security would go, 'She keeps trying to get backstage'. It then became apparent that 'It's that girl again'. "Then she started turning up at hotels and trying to get into my room." Noel, who has sons Donovan and Sonny with wife Sara MacDonald, 46, called police when the woman tracked him down to his Belgian hotel after a gig. The Don't Look Back In Anger singer told pal Matt Morgan's podcast: "There's this knock on the door and it's this girl. "So I recognise it's her by looking through the little peephole. She's getting more irate. So I text my security guard. There's an altercation outside the door. "I'm sitting on the end of the bed with a little tub of Pringles and a Mars bar eating them with my legs crossed while she gets carted off by the hotel security."  He declined an offer of help from police, but his bodyguard stayed on watch in the corridor overnight. Noel added: "I got up in the morning and I was having a laugh with my security guard. "He said, 'You're not going to believe this - she's sat in the café directly across the street.' "She was sat in the café window doing the same suggestive hand movements."
