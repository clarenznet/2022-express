Holly Willoughby, 41, looked flawless as she posed topless with wet hair after getting out of the shower. Holding a towel in her hand, Holly showed off her natural beauty and perfectly smooth, blemish-free skin. The presenter shared a quote by poet Gemma Troy alongside the selfie, which was shared with her Wylde Moon account's 152,000 followers: "Whatever makes you feel the sun from the inside out chase that." Holly's fans were stunned by the candid snap. It comes after The Games viewers praised presenters Holly and Freddie Flintoff for their "chemistry" on-screen - and say it could be bad news for Phillip Schofield, who is usually one half of a presenting duo with the blonde beauty. The stars hosted ITV's latest series that saw six male and six female celebrity competitors battle it out in the athletics arena, the swimming pool, gymnasium and velodrome.
