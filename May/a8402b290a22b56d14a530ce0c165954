Aldi is the latest supermarket to issue a food recall. The supermarket giant sells a range of sandwiches, wraps and other lunchtime snacks and food-to-go. One product from this range has been recalled. A food recall is when there is a problem with a product meaning it should not be sold. Instead, it is withdrawn - taken off the shelves - and customers are then asked to return the product to the store. Here are all the details.
