The Emir of Qatar met The Queen at Windsor Castle and Her Majesty seemed delighted with the visit. Queen Elizabeth opted for a summery dress to meet Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. This is not the first time the monarch is seen wearing a midi dress with floral motifs as this is one of her favourite options during the summer months. She recently donned a very similar floral dress, also in blue and green tones, to meet the President of Switzerland last month. This time, Her Majesty combined the dress with black shoes. For jewellery, the Queen donned a pair of pearl earrings and one of her favourite pearl necklaces. Royals fans took to social media to praise the monarch's lovely outfit. Twitter user @steps_ka commented: "Queen Elizabeth II is in a good mood... wonderful! "Great respect for strong woman."  Royal fan @loveforcambridg said: "Love how tiny the Queen is! So cute." Another one, @sdfashionista3, said: "She is looking radiant!!" Royal watcher @lfp6 added: "Good to see Her Majesty back doing her thing." Social media user @NancyLipschult2 commented: "Lovely!" The Queen was last seen at the Chelsea Flower Show, in London, earlier this week. For the occasion, Her Majesty donned a bright pink coat and a floral dress. The monarch was all smiles as she arrived at the Chelsea Flower Show where she was seen taking a tour of the gardens by buggy. "Adjustments have been made for the Queen's comfort," a Buckingham Palace spokesperson explained. The Queen chose the Pink Lemonade coat by Stewart Parvin to attend the Chelsea Flower Show. She combined her colourful ensemble with black flat shoes and a pair of white gloves.
