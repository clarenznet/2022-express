With the Jubilee right around the corner, it’s the perfect time to get ready for the bank holiday by buying your favourite drinks. Summery and festive for the royal event, nothing tastes more like an English summer than a jug of Pimm’s. Whether you mix it with Champagne or enjoy it ice cubes and apples, the refreshing drink is the perfect beverage to enjoy with friends or family for the Platinum Jubilee. Bringing to mind hot days and Wimbledon, the most popular version is the Pimm’s No. 1 Cup drink and the gin-based spirit is made from a secret mixture of herbal botanicals, caramelised orange and lemonade. In addition, there are several other delicious variations including the raspberry-inspired Pimm’s Sundowner, Pimm’s Blackberry and Elderflower Liqueur and canned versions that are ideal for park drinks.
