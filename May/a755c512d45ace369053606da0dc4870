Fancy £200 to spend at Amazon, Tesco, John Lewis or Argos? Well, that's exactly what Virgin Media is offering some customers who sign up for certain broadband and TV bundles. The UK telecoms firm has numerous deals - available until tomorrow, May 18, - which come with a free voucher that can be used in popular stores across the UK. For example, anyone joining Virgin's Ultimate Volt bundle will be offered a £200 voucher for free which can then be spent in places such as John Lewis, Amazon or Argos. There's also £200 for those joining the Biggest TV bundle and £150 if you sign up for the Bigger bundle + Movies option. Anyone wanting more basic bundles will find they'll receive £75 back with this offer available on Virgin's Big bundle, Big bundle + Drama & Docs and the Big Volt bundle. If those offers of free money aren't appealing then don't panic as you can also opt for up to £200 of credit to be added to your bill instead which should help reduce the cost of Virgin's services.
