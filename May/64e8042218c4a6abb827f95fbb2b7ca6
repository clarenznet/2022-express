 Photographs taken today show a large police cordon is still in place and there is a heavy police presence. A banner that was stuck up across the front window of the property reads "Birthday Girl," Liverpool Echo reports. Liverpool Echo reporter Paddy Edrich said: "Police efforts are focused just on the one house. The front door stands open and blue tarpaulins have been pulled over the ground outside the entrance. At the top of the three storey property a skylight is also open." Merseyside Police, who were called to the address at 9.55pm yesterday, say investigations are at an early stage. Detective Inspector Gary Stratton, of the force, said: "We are in the extremely early stages of an investigation, and I would appeal to anyone who has any information at all to come forward. "Investigations are ongoing to establish exactly what happened and our officers are at the scene while we conduct house-to-house enquiries and gather information. "If you saw or heard any suspicious behaviour in the area this evening then please let us know. Similarly if you were driving down Longmoor Lane and have dashcam footage then please review it and contact us if you see anything. All information you hold could be vital to our investigation." Roads in the suburban area were closed last night but have since reopened.
