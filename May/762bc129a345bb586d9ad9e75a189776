Italian choreographer Bruno, 66, has been at the heart of the BBC dance contest since it began in 2004. But after two years of Covid travel restrictions kept him in America, he reportedly decided to leave and instead focus on judging the US version of Strictly. A source said: "Bruno has quit the show for good. He's going to be a judge only on Dancing With The Stars." The BBC told the Daily Express it would not be commenting on the news. But presenter Lorraine Kelly told viewers of her ITV morning show that stand-in judge Anton, 55, should be given the role. She said: "No official word yet on his replacement, but it's got to be Anton Du Beke. Come on, it's got to be. It would be silly if it wasn't."  Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood, 57, said he had read about the claims but added: "I guess there will be an official announcement tomorrow." Bruno has lived in London since 1975 but in 2017 bought a home in West Hollywood. He appeared as a Strictly judge via video link in 2020, but Anton stood in for him last year. Anton, who also joined Strictly in 2004, but as a dancer, said last month he had not been told if he is returning to the judging panel. He added: "I'm hoping to get a call...But we'll wait and see."
