May the Fourth be with you! On Star Wars Day today, Disney have launched the new trailer for their Obi-Wan Kenobi miniseries ahead of its release later this month. The new footage concludes with the first look at Hayden Christensen’s Darth Vader. We can hear his iconic breathing and see shots of his suit, in what appears to be a scene with him being reunited with Ewan McGregor’s Jedi for the first time since Revenge of the Sith. The synopsis reads: "The story begins 10 years after the dramatic events of “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” where Obi-Wan Kenobi faced his greatest defeat—the downfall and corruption of his best friend and Jedi apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, who turned to the dark side as evil Sith Lord Darth Vader. The series stars Ewan McGregor, reprising his role as the iconic Jedi Master, and also marks the return of Hayden Christensen in the role of Darth Vader. Joining the cast are Moses Ingram, Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Kumail Nanjiani, Indira Varma, Rupert Friend, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Sung Kang, Simone Kessell and Benny Safdie." Obi-Wan Kenobi hits Disney+ on May 27, 2022 with its first two episodes.
