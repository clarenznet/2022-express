Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced all households in bands A to D would receive a £150 council tax refund as well as £200 towards energy bills later. It’s hoped the money will help ease the financial pain caused by the cost of living crisis. While the council tax rebate of £150 has started appearing in some people’s bank accounts, some people are still waiting. Councils have until September to process the refunds but many cash strapped Britons are hoping they will receive it sooner. Some councils have been quicker off the mark than others but 16 have promised they will make the payments in May. For some people who are struggling to make ends meet it could be a lifeline.

Martyn James of consumer rights website Resolver said: “The current advice is to go on to your local council website where there should be some updates.” While some people will be desperate for the refund, Britons are being warned not to fall for a Council Tax refund scam doing the rounds. They are being reminded councils would never cold call someone to ask for their bank details over the phone. Britons who don’t live in band A to D properties might still be able to get financial support. They are advised to get in touch with their local authority if they are in financial difficulty. All councils have a Household Support Fund totalling £1 billion designed to support families with the cost of living. Each local authority sets its own rules so it’s impossible to say who will qualify. What is happening where you live?
