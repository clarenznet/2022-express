The initiative was set up by democracy-loving Sir David Amess, MP for Southend West, who was tragically murdered by an Islamic fanatic last year.  Alongside the grooming of children online, terrorism (25 percent) and identity theft (10 percent) were also listed as subjects which worry young people. The online debate - which was broadcast by Wakelet.com across the Daily Express website and the newspaper’s YouTube, Facebook and Twitter accounts – involved 251 junior representatives, all primary school age, from constituencies around the UK.  In association with the Daily Express, the next Wakelet Microsoft 365 Sir David Amess National Children's Parliament will look for 650 would-be aged seven to 11 MPs to take part in a special commemorative debate in the main chamber of the real British Parliament to commemorate the first anniversary of Sir David's death on the October 15, 2022. His eldest daughter Katie Amess, patron of the Children’s Parliament, said: “The success of this Parliament in giving a real voice to some quite remarkable children and in teaching the parliamentary process is something I am very proud to be associated with. “My father’s passion for both the British Parliament and for educating children is reflected wonderfully in this venture that he helped to design.”
