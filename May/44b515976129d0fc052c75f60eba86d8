Hollywood star Cameron Diaz has recreated her look as Mary Jensen from her hit 1998 film, There's Something About Mary. Taking to social media, the star, 49, shared a hilarious skit which saw her revisit the character as she recreated the 90's look. The reel, which she shared in view of her nine million followers, started with influencer Benito Skinner and his boyfriend on their way to the actress's house for dinner. The star had dressed exactly the same as Cameron in her role as Mary, red dress and all, and the Hollywood icon looked stunned when she opened her front door to greet the guests. However, the star shrugged it off and welcomed the couple into her stunning home. They went on to crack open cans of Cameron's wine line, Avaline, while both sporting the same look.
