Loren Schauers, 20, from Great Falls in Montana, has been left without both his legs and right forearm following a freak accident in September 2019 while working on a bridge with a forklift. He fell 50ft and the machine severed his arm and crushed his lower body. The construction worker underwent hemicorporectomy surgery which meant his body below his waist was amputated to save his life. Doctors in the US feared he would not survive after the operation but he continues to make a good recovery. Loren now regularly shares updates with followers on his YouTube account with his wife Sabia Reiche, 23. She has stayed by his side throughout the ordeal and helps care for him. Speaking on their YouTube channel, Sabia discussed uncertainty over Loren's life expectancy. She said: "It's touch-and-go, there's no for sure. "The average is about 11 years and the record-holder was 24 years. "But none of them were in the same situation as Loren. "If we go off of that we are hoping Loren has 40 plus years left with us. "Because his case was so rare it's hard to pinpoint." The couple are currently fundraising for a new bionic arm for Loren to improve his quality of life. The fundraiser says: "This fundraiser will help get me a Bionic Arm through Atom Limbs that will restore full sense of touch and movement of each digit in the hand.  "This would bring so much more to my life! "Every dollar, penny, message that you guys send means so much to me! "This fight has been a crazy one! "I’m happy to say though that I have a million and nne people backing me and rooting me on to keep fighting! "I love and appreciate you all! Words don’t do any of you all justice!"
