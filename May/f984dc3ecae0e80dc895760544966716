Another user, Christopher Ryan Deel, explained: "This is mind-blowing to me! Thank you! I LOVE making avocado toast for breakfast but they go bad so quick." Maria Dejesus added: "Omg tried it. It really works put them when they are ripe and boom three weeks later, last one is still fresh."  Therefore, it is possible to keep avocados ripe for longer with a bit of extra care. Whole avocados are easier to store than halves as the peel protects them from oxidation. Ready-to-eat avocados are best kept in the fridge. This is to slow down the ripening process. Ideally, they should be stored in the low-humidity drawer, where fruit and vegetables should also be kept, as it is the coolest fridge compartment with less humidity. Avocados last between two and three days when stored this way. Not-ready-to-eat avocados need to be kept at room temperature to speed up the ripening process. The best place is in a bowl which can be placed on the kitchen counter away from direct sunlight. Ripening could take up to five days. This can be done by gently pressing on the avocado to see if they yield. To keep ready avocado halves from turning brown, add a sprinkle of lemon juice, lime juice, or olive oil, wrap it in plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge. Avocado flesh can also be protected with water. Place the avocado half flesh-side-down in a little container filled with water, cover it and place it in the fridge for up to two days.
