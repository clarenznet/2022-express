  Jack Downham, 20, told Express.co.uk and other publications how he would sometimes experience the “odd interaction” with members of the public where he would have to reassure them he is “nothing like” his character on Emmerdale. Jack portrays Noah Dingle, who is currently involved in a particularly creepy stalker plotline.    Jack’s storyline currently revolves around his relationship with ex-girlfriend Chloe Harris, who is played by Jessica Elland. His character Noah has become obsessed with Chloe despite their romance being over, and he has started trying to find ways to win her back through manipulating situations. Jack admitted that he had been approached while out in public, since his character took a rather unsympathetic turn, in an interview with Express.co.uk and other publications. When asked what the reaction had been to his stalker story so far, he replied: “Well, you do get the odd little interaction in public where people think that you might be like your character in real life.       “But I promise I’m not!” Jack added with a laugh. “But yeah, it's been really different and I played a totally different side to Noah.” He went on to mention Noah’s dad Chris Tate (played by Peter Amory), who was previously married to his mum Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) before he committed suicide, attempting to frame her for his murder. Reflecting on his character, Jack continued: “Maybe we’re seeing more of the Tate side coming through and his dad that’s never come through really before.”    Jack went on to confirm that he’d had a very enjoyable experience getting his teeth into his new storyline. Referring to his character Noah, he said: “It’s been good, especially because he has the background for it and he has the motives for it. “You can see why these things have happened to him and why he’s got these wrong thoughts. “I think it's been really good,” he added.        Jack also spoke about filming a “special week” for Emmerdale, with plenty of exciting flash-forwards to keep fans hooked. “I was really pleased when I found out that we were doing a special week,” he said. “Obviously, I haven't seen any of it, so I'm really looking forward to watching it. “And seeing how it all plays out, because you see it in the scripts, and then it could look totally different on TV.”      Noah’s character has had a tough time on the soap, being born to mum Charity while she was falsely imprisoned for the murder of her late husband Chris. Baby Noah was born three months early, and had to have emergency surgery, before being whisked away by his aunt Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) and banned from seeing his mum. When Charity gets out of prison thanks to a deal she made with Zoe, she is able to reclaim custody of Noah as Zoe is ruled an unfit guardian due to her mental health issues. After that, the mum and son took off to live in Spain, but it was only a matter of time before The Dales would call them back. Emmerdale continues tonight at 7.30pm on ITV.
