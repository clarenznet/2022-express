Chelsea transfer chiefs will find out whether Real Madrid star Casemiro will be available to buy in the summer transfer window after his appearance in the upcoming Champions League final against Liverpool on May 28. The midfielder, 30, has formed a superb partnership with maestros Toni Kroos and Luka Madrid over the years. However, it is reported that he wants a raise on his current wages at the Bernabeu. His contract runs until June 2025, but the club are not willing to increase his pay packet even though they are keen to keep him. And with Chelsea waiting in the wings to sign a midfielder this summer, The Daily Mirror claim that they could be alerted to his departure should Casemiro indicate he's ready to move on. Casemiro and his agency are willing to sit down with Real chiefs after the final to discuss his future. If he wishes to stay on the same salary, then the side from the capital are willing to keep him on. But if he makes the decision to move on, Chelsea would have to cough up a fee of over £40million to land their man. “If we are going to look [in the market] for a copy of Casemiro, we’ll make a mistake,” Ancelotti said to Diario AS. “There are none in world football. He’s unique. But other players can play as a pivot. Camavinga played there, who has other characteristics. He carries the ball well but he doesn’t have Casemiro’s tactical ability. "I’ve never had a pivot like him. I had [Andrea] Pirlo [at Milan] who had different characteristics. You have to adapt to what you have.” Chelsea face a huge summer if they are to press on and finally challenge for the title next term. Several of their stars are out of contract and others are expected to enter the final year of their deals, meaning a huge overhaul is needed. Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus are other suitors for the Brazilian's signature. And he will demand a three-year deal at Chelsea if he was to make the move to Stamford Bridge.
