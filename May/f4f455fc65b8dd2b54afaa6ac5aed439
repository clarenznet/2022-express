Boy George, 60, is known for his out there style and eccentric hats, with his fashion statements being pivotal in the 80s and 90s. However, the singer looked different from his usual attire as he was pictured during an outing in London. The Karma Chameleon singer stepped out in navy tracksuit bottoms and an oversized sweatshirt as he showed off his dance moves to his friend. His flamboyant hat was nowhere to be seen, with the actor accessorising with a beanie instead. He finished off the outfit with a pair of chunky brown boots as he practised his dance moves. After showing off his moves, the singer took a break as he sat on a stool with his hand on his stomach. The singer was last pictured yesterday evening at the I Don't Take Requests Book Launch Party. He posed in his usual dress alongside the likes of Russell Tovey and Claire Sweeney. Boy George is currently preparing to go on tour with the Culture Club.
