Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and his new wife, billionaire heiress Nicola Peltz, 27, enjoyed a relaxed night out in London earlier this week. The happy couple seemed to be having fun as they stepped out for a drink in Soho on Thursday. The pair shared photos of their outing, during which they posed in front of The Glassblower pub, part of the budget-friendly Wetherspoons chain. In the snaps, Brooklyn could be seen giving Nicola a piggyback while she lovingly kissed him on the cheek, just weeks after their opulent, star-studded wedding took place in Florida. The stylish couple kept their outfits casual and comfortable in their visit to the Central London boozer. Brooklyn wore a plain white T-shirt and beige jeans, which he accessorised with a gold necklace. Nicola opted for some wide-legged red trousers and a navy cardigan, with her hair up in a slick, low ponytail.
