Designer John Everiss had the idea when his Bomber Command father Stan finally began to talk about his dramatic survival from the crash during the Second World War. John's son George modelled for the statue, funded by the RAF Benevolent Fund and commemorating the Battle of Britain. John, 56, of Chorley, Lancs, said: "My father never really talked about the war until he retired, and then he started doing talks himself. I found out that, on his 19th mission, he got shot down in northern France. "The plane crashed bet­ween two trees, knocked the wings off and the fuse­ lage slid down the field. "They all survived but he was too badly injured to walk so they hid him in a ditch. He buried his service watch along with his camera, and escaped with the help of the Resistance." Stan returned to the crash site in 1947. "My dad recovered the camera and my son is wearing the service watch you see on the statue." Constructed from 223 lay­ers of stainless steel, the 12ft memorial is a moving tribute to all those who have served and continue to serve in the RAF. It took pride of place in John's Chelsea garden and after the show's closure yes­terday, is set to be moved to the RAF base at Biggin Hill. John said: "This was my sixth Chelsea and I've never had a reaction like this. Photos of the statue went around the world." He insists that we need to think of new ways to "memorialise" the war. "Whatever you think of Bomber Command, these were RAF personnel asked to do a job. It wasn't of their own volition, they were part of an operation. "These were just ordi­nary people and 55,000 Bomber Command person­nel lost their lives."
