Jeremy Corbyn, 72, will address efforts to tackle climate change as he gives a keynote speech this afternoon. The longstanding MP for Islington North will appear at the Climate Summit in the centre of Bristol. Hosted by the Bristol Climate Justice Coalition, the event also features the South African scholar and activist, Trevor Ngwane. The summit includes workshops on climate strategy, the Global South, climate justice, and energy, war and climate. Mr Corbyn backed nationalising energy companies and employing a “green industrial revolution” to tackle the climate emergency. He called for the “public ownership of energy, of water and all the other transport industries, with public investment”. This, he said, was necessary to “end the domination of private greed that has done so much damage to our country, our environment and our planet”. However, as he outlined his arguments he was interrupted when an agitated Piers began protesting. The MP’s brother jumped from his seat wearing a “Resist! Defy! Don’t comply!” anti-lockdown T-shirt, according to The Guardian. “They tried to remove me and they gave up.” He was asked if he gets on well with his brother, to which he replied: “Well… most of the time.” After the event, the conspiracy theorist handed out leaflets claiming that man-made climate change does not exist. Other material he distributed called on the Government to “stop jabbing children”. This week, Piers was fined £250 for saying that NHS workers at a London hospital were “murdering people”. He accosted staff at a jabs clinic at Guy's Hospital in January with a “cease and desist letter” to try and stop them vaccinating people.
