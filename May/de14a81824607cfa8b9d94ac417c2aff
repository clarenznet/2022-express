The National Lottery has another jackpot in store for Britons tonight, just a day after the Set for Life draw. One lucky player started the week with a guaranteed £10,000 a month in hand for 30 years, £3,600,000 in total. Today, however, they stand to win much more, with an "epic" £44 million on the cards. The National Lottery usually announces results in the evening, around an hour after ticket sales close. Tonight, that deadline was 7.30pm, and EuroMillions operators will release the results within the hour following. Tonight's winning numbers are 10, 13, 27, 36 and 37, and the two winning Lucky Stars are 2 and 10 READ MORE: Retired nurse shares 'impact on retirement' after losing over £36,000 Winning the £44 million jackpot will require players to match five main numbers on one of their tickets and two Lucky Stars.

The lottery revealed on May 19 that Joe and Jess Thwaite, a Gloucester couple, had won the largest jackpot in its history. They claimed £184,262,899 from a EuroMillions draw conducted on May 10 after buying a lucky dip ticket. Mr Thwaite, an occasional lottery player during "big jackpots", bought the ticket. Mrs Thwaite said the win had given the couple "time to dream", something they hadn't had before. She added they would use the win to "share lots of experiences and go on adventures with our family and friends". The couple shared the news as they didn't "want to lie to family and friends", choosing to "enjoy it with them" instead. They first planned only to tell a "few people" before realising "it would be a burden asking them to keep it quiet".
