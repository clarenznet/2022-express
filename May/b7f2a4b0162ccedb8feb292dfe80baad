  Rochelle, 33, swept across the red carpet in a bedazzled black dress, decorated with hundreds of sparkling gems. The gown was made out of a mesh material which put her bottom on display as she flashed her underwear before giving a glimpse of her cleavage in the see-through number. The garment also featured a daring cut-out which showed off the This Morning presenter's black beaded bra and toned tummy. The dress had long sleeves, a high neckline, and a small train that trailed behind the star. Rochelle wore her hair in a sophisticated low bun, which helped draw attention to her stunning features. She accessorised with a pair of gorgeous drop-down diamond earrings, a bangle, and a few rings. The star opted for a winged-eyeliner look which she paired with a warm-toned lip gloss. Rochelle dazzled the crowd at Palais des Festivals in France, where the 75th annual Cannes film festival is being held this week.
