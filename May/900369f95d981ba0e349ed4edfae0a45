Paolo Banchero and Patrick Mahomes have now both reacted on social media to the viral video of Martin Brundle's hilarious gaffe on his usual grid walk at the Miami Grand Prix. A-list celebrities and sports stars from around the world were on the grid for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix.  Brundle's grid walk is usually a place for the Sky Sports pundit to grab some time with the drivers and team bosses. But this weekend saw Brundle rub shoulders with the Williams sisters as well as DJ Khaled and Dwyane Wade. His most memorable moment came seconds later though after being told that NFL superstar Mahomes was close by. Brundle thought he was caught up with Mahomes and began asking him about the atmosphere at the Miami circuit. However, Brundle quickly realised that it wasn't Mahomes he was speaking too. The former F1 driver awkwardly asked who he was interviewing before finding out it was college basketball star Banchero. The hilarious case of mistaken identity soon went viral on social media with the interview watched over a million times. Banchero clearly saw the funny side as he tweeted: "I'm just vibing right now man." And Mahomes also caught wind of the incident, tweeting: "Bro ain’t no way." Upon realising he was interviewing the wrong person, Brundle said: “OK. It’s not Patrick. That’s why he ignored me in the beginning.  “What is your name Sir?” Brundle added politely. “Paolo Banchero,” the American replied. “Right well I thought I was talking to somebody else. Sorry about that,” Brundle responded with a wry smile. Banchero is a projected top-three pick in this year's NBA Draft after a stellar campaign with Duke. He averaged 17.2 points and 7.8 rebounds while also being a consistent shooter from three.
