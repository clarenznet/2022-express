Callum went on to praise his "professionalism" and revealed a particular story that may have landed him in trouble with Samuel. He explained that in the first series, he spent a lot of time with Derek but recently found a new friend in Seigfried: "He is starting to spend a lot of time with Seigfried, and it's put my nose out of joint a little bit. "I tended to be Derek in series one like barking down the phone, but Derek, who plays Tricki, is a class act, he is professional. "There is a story that I always tell, but I am sort of throwing Sam under the bus, but he's not here. Callum interjected and passionately explained: "The laws had just changed about that before we started. "Our producer said he wanted the first season of the show to redefine the rules on filming with animals and how we do it, and I certainly believe we have done that." For season three, change is afoot for all the residents of Darrowby, pushing their limits to the maximum but not without bringing them together. The change is especially hard for James and Helen, who are embarking on the next chapter of their lives as the wider world around them heads toward a period of great uncertainty. All Creatures Great and Small returns later in 2022 on Channel 5.
