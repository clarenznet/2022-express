Our neighbours can boast of classics such as Camembert and Brie but UK makers have unleashed a wave of artisan cheeses. Edward Hancock, the founder of Cheesegeek site, said we now produce 1,000 varieties, almost double the French total of 550. Artisan cheeses tend to be made by hand using traditional skills. Edward credits the British cheese "rennet-ssance" to the hundreds of small-scale family makers. He added: "The dairy industry faces challenges but this gives opportunities. "The key dynamic here is the cheaper price of milk."
