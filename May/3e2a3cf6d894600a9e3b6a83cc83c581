New photos were released this week to mark the Princess's seventh birthday on May 2 - taken by the Duchess of Cambridge. Kate Middleton photographed Charlotte sitting in a field of bluebells in Norfolk with her arm around the family's cocker spaniel, Orla. The public will likely see the young royal attend more engagements such as church services now that she is seven, reports The Mirror. It comes as William and Kate are said to be considering a move to a cottage ten minutes walk from the Queen in Windsor. Earlier this year, The Duke of Cambridge told how one of the few things the children fight about is who gets to choose the music in the background.   He said: "What I've been amazed by is how much my children already have inherited my family's love of music. "Most mornings there's a massive fight between Charlotte and Prince George as to what song is played. "And I have to, now, basically prioritise that one day someone does this one, and another day it's someone else's turn. "So, George gets his go, then Charlotte gets her go. Such is the clamour for the music." He revealed how Charlotte likes to play the song Waka Waka by Colombian pop star Shakira every morning. He added: "It's a really happy moment where the children just enjoy dancing, messing around, and singing." Charlotte has been seen in public on two occasions recently. She was with her parents and brother Prince George at the Easter Sunday service at St George's Chapel in Windsor on April 17. On March 29 she attended the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service at Westminster Abbey with her parents and brother for what was the Cambridge children's first outing at a major church event.
