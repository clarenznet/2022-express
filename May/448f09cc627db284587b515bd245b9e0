Camilla, 74, has changed into her second outfit of the day. This morning the Duchess of Cornwall was dazzling in red. However, now Camilla is in a navy and white ensemble.  This dress coat happens to be the same one she wore to the Maundy Thursday service last month with her husband Prince Charles. The dress coat is navy blue in colour with white vertical stripes on the lapel and sides of her dress. Camilla paired the dress with a pair of simple and practical black kitten heel shoes. The windy weather showed Camilla’s simple gold earrings underneath her gorgeous blonde hair.
