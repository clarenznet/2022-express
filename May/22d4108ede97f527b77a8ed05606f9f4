Taking the top spot for Brits most popular sarnie is the Ploughman's Cheese,  followed by the humble Ham and Cheese and in third place, the righteous Roast Chicken and Stuffing. The research from Costa Coffee, unveiled at the start of British Sandwich Week, also found that sandwiches in general topped the list for the nation’s favourite lunch, voted for by over a third of the nation, followed by Ploughman’s lunch and jacket potatoes. Whilst having a sandwich, it turns out that the UK’s favourite condiments came out as Mayonnaise, Ketchup, Salad Cream, and English Mustard. Brits also no longer prioritise their lunch breaks since the start of the pandemic, with 44% now eating alone, and a third (33%) claiming their breaks are too short. As such, Costa Coffee and M&S Food have collaborated to create a series of special benches designed to help the nation reclaim their lunch break and to enjoy a coffee and a sandwich. The benches will be in the cities that take the shortest lunch breaks: Newcastle (where on average they take just a 22 minute break), Manchester (23 minutes 48 seconds) and Glasgow (24 minutes 18 seconds). Brought to life by local artists Hazel Oakes (Newcastle), Jenny Leonard (Manchester) and Lewi Quinn (Glasgow), each bench has been creatively designed and inspired by local culture and skylines and is a colourful celebration of what they love about each of their cities. Reflecting on the importance of slowing down and reclaiming lunch breaks, Naomi Matthews, Food and Beverage Commercial Director UK & Ireland at Costa Coffee, said: “Taking a lunch break is so important to our wellbeing and with so many people now experiencing shorter lunchtimes or not taking a lunch break at all, we hope our unique benches give people an opportunity to unwind and recharge.”
