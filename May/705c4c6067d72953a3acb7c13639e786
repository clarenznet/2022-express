Nintendo gamers may be sitting on a small fortune without even realising it as some rare and expensive N64, Wii U, DS and NES games have recently shot up in value. Retro gaming website PriceCharting has released its latest Hot Items list, which shows the games that in the past week have experienced the biggest price jump. And six out of the top 10 collectives that have increased in value recently are Nintendo-related. The retro gaming item which has increased in value the most is a rare Nintendo DS cart. The Zelda Twilight Princess Preview Trailer cart was a DS cart that was handed out at E3 which, as you can guess by the name, featured a trailer for the GameCube and Wii Zelda adventure. PriceCharting says a loose version of this cart has jumped up in value by almost £300, with this now valued at just over £925. Another retro gaming collectible which has seen a big price jump is Clay Fighter Sculptors Cut for the Nintendo 64. READ MORE: Own these PlayStation, Nintendo or SEGA games?

NES game Flintstones Surprise at Dinosaur Peak has also experienced a price increased of just over £101, with a loose version of this old school Taito game now valued at £1,337.17. If, however, you're lucky enough to have a brand new version of this NES game then you'll be pleased to know it's incredibly worth over £10,000 now. In terms of more recent releases, the whacky Devil's Third for the Wii U has also seen its price rise recently. The value of this Wii U exclusive has gone up recently by £86 to £228. If you wish to, you can find a full list of the top 10 retro games which have seen the biggest price rises recently. Prices listed for loose versions of these games (or in one case accessory) along with the relevant format are listed below. Just bear in mind with retro games the region an item is released in (i.e Japan, North America, Europe) can have a bearing on its value. The value of a game will also change depending on whether you have a loose, complete in box (i.e game, manual, inserts and box) or brand new version.
