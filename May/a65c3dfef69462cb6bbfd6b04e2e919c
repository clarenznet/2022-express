Gemma Hope, of charity Leonard Cheshire, said: “Many disabled people can’t afford to gamble on energy firms’ social tariffs, but inconsistency in terms of availability means they are forced to do just that.” Kamran Mallick, of Disability Rights UK, said: “Energy firms have been offering people heated blankets. It beggars belief that this kind of insulting measure is all that is left on the table. It costs £600 a month more on average to live with a disability.” Richard Kramer, chief executive of Sense, said: “We need the Government to recognise the pressures facing disabled people and to provide targeted financial support. Suppliers should offer extra support.” Energy UK said: “Struggling customers should contact suppliers as there are a range of schemes offering financial support…but the size of bill rises and numbers affected means the industry can’t provide all the help needed.”
