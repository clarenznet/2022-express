The 96-year-old's seven decades of service will be commemorated in events across the country during the upcoming four-day bank holiday. In the meantime, Queen Elizabeth II is pacing herself due to health issues, such as decreased mobility. One example is the announcement that she will miss the beloved Epsom Derby, which would be a personal highlight for her. Instead, she will be represented at the Epsom Derby on Saturday, June 4, by her daughter, the Princess Royal. For the past few weeks, she has been on a pre-Jubilee break resting in Balmoral, Scotland, hoping to ease the episodic mobility problems that she has been facing. And, over the past few months, the Queen has missed several public engagements, such as the State Opening of Parliament. However, Her Majesty will appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony twice - once on Thursday, after the Trooping the Colour parade, and again after the Pageant parade finale on Sunday. But the Queen’s gradually declining health has forced her to change the way she performs her duties for some time now. The monarch is living full-time at Windsor Castle and uses the estate as her working base, Newsweek reported. The London royal residence had been traditionally viewed as the Queen’s "workplace", up until the COVID-19 pandemic. From Windsor, the Queen has conducted in-person and virtual audiences with visiting dignitaries, such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Members of the Government and representatives of her associated charities have also been visiting the monarch at her Windsor home. Occasionally, the monarch has been on external visits, such as the one for the service of thanksgiving for the life of Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey in March. Most recently, she attended the opening of the London railway line named in her honour - the "Elizabeth Line" - as well as the Chelsea Flower Show. Due to her mobility difficulties, the monarch has had to cancel more engagements in the past, too.
