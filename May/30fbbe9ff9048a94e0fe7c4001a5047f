Lewis Hamilton WILL be fined by the FIA if he fails to stop wearing jewellery while driving in F1, Mohammed ben Sulayem has confirmed. F1 has had rules in place for drivers wearing jewellery for several years now, but it's only this year the FIA have appeared to stamp down on those regulations. Hamilton has been outspoken on the matter, questioning why the FIA are only enforcing the safety rule now. The 37-year-old appeared to buckle to the FIA pressure at the Miami Grand Prix by removing nearly all his jewellery. Hamilton reportedly held a conversation with FIA doctor Sean Petherbridge just before practice for the Miami Grand Prix. But he's been given just a two-race 'grace period' to remove other piercings on his body. That agreement only runs until the end of the month, putting in jeopardy his chances of competing at the Monaco Grand Prix. Reports have indicated that Hamilton could be banned from driving in the prestigious race at the end of May. JUST IN:Â Norris explains where Hamilton has 'one of the best cars on the grid'  Ben Sulayem has now spoken publicly for the first time on the jewellery ban being enforced by the FIA. And, while the FIA president stopped short of saying whether Hamilton would be banned from driving in Monaco, he did confirm that fines will be issued. "That's up to him. There are fines that apply," he told the Daily Mail. "It's like if someone speeds on the roads - you can't stop them doing it but they get fined, even if it was accidental. DON'T MISS  "You can't let people off because they are your friends. There has to be one rule for all, and that's that." He added: "I love jewellery. "I absolutely love it. But in the car there can be no choice. People say they (the rules) haven't been implemented before. Don't ask me why not. "People can ask the old regime why that is the case." F1 returns to Europe next week for the Spanish Grand Prix where all eyes will once again be on Hamilton and whether he will have removed his nose piercing.
