The small plane crashed into the Belledonne Mountains near the town of Isere at around 5pm (local time) this evening. Four of the passengers were members of the same family, according to reports.  Around 60 firefighters rushed to the crash site. The small Jodel D140 type passenger plane was taking part in its maiden voyage after it took off from the Versoud aerodrome near Grenoble, southeast France, and was taking part in its maiden voyage, which would have been a half hour flight. Witnesses said the bodies of four adults and a child were pulled out of the plane’s burnt-out wreckage. Regional officials said Grenoble prosecutors have ordered an investigation into the crash. Reports suggest the small tourist plane was on its first flight.
