Joe Biden has been slapped down by China expert Gordon Chang over the US President's reluctance to brand Xi Jinping's communist state an enemy of the United States. Mr Chang believes that Beijing has already declared a "People's war on America," having clearly singled out the US as an enemy in Chinese state propaganda.   Mr Chang told Fox News: "I mean, People's Daily is the most authoritative publication in China, when People's Daily speak that's China speaking, People's Daily has declared a quote-unquote people's war on America. "In other words, they've designated us an enemy. "That drumbeat of hostile propaganda continues to today. "It's very clear that Chin and they make no bones about it, they want to subvert the American government.  "They want to take over the United States, and I know that sounds ludicrous to people but you got to listen to what the Chinese are actually saying." He added: "So yes, they are the enemy. "Unfortunately, we're not willing to call them that, or at least our President isn't willing to use that term. "He's not even willing to use the term adversary!" The China expert also warned that the Chinese leadership are "clearly thinking about invading somebody" amid fears Xi Jinping could launch an invasion of Taiwan. On Saturday, Mr Chang told Fox Business: "This is getting ominous because the Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that China is trying to sanction prove its senior officials. "Now they wouldn't do that unless they were thinking they were going to do something which we would impose sanctions on them, like invading Taiwan or some other nation. "So the Chinese military is always constantly trying to improve itself to get itself more ready. Clearly they're thinking about invading somebody."  It comes as US President Joe Biden and his new South Korean counterpart agreed on Saturday to hold bigger joint military drills.
