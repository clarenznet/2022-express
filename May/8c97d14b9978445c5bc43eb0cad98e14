The tennis coach and mum of Grand Slam champions Andy and Jamie said she was left shaken and felt sick after the incident eight years ago. Judy, 62, spoke out in the wake of a walkout from a sports awards ceremony in Scotland where sexist and racist jokes were made during after-dinner speeches. The coach said it gave her the courage to describe her sexual assault by an executive sat next to her at a function set up by an educational organisation. Judy said: “Towards the end of the meal, it was clear he had had quite a bit to drink and he put his hand on my knee. I removed his hand and leaned forward to pour myself some water. As I did he slipped his hand down the back of my trousers. I got up and went to the bathroom. I wanted to throw up. It rocked me so badly. “I sat in the loos for ages and decided to do the speech but didn’t go back until I knew it was time for me to go on.” Judy is now urging more men to join women and challenge sexism and misogyny. She said: “Women have found their voices and are calling out all sorts of sexist behaviour. It has given confidence to others. “Far too often women are made to feel the world of sport is not for us and our presence is neither welcome nor important. If we don’t make a noise nobody hears us.”
