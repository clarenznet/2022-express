A photo shared on social media shows a statue of the Virgin Mary where Russian soldiers reportedly stood to beg for forgiveness for the atrocities committed during the war. The statue appears to be built outside the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God, in Gostomel, near Kyiv. On the base of the statue, a message is written in pink paint. The message translates to “Mommy of God, forgive us your sons”. The photo was shared on Twitter by Illia Ponomarenko, defence reporter with The Kyiv Independent. Posting the picture, Illia wrote: “Hostomel. “This was probably written by Russians (please correct me if I’m wrong), a Mary monument in front of a local church. “‘Mommy of God, forgive us your sons.’” And the reporter continued by commenting: “Yes, you kinda have a lot to answer for in his battered town.” With the war is in its second month, the morale of the Russian army seems to have crashed.
