The SexyBack hitmaker's big-money deal was with Hipgnosis Song Management and a fund backed by private equity firm Blackstone. The American singer and movie actor, 41, has sold over 150 million records - 88 million as a solo artist and 70 million with boy band Nsync.  Hipgnosis will profit when the tracks are used in soundtracks, or played on the radio and online. Timberlake, who is married to US actress Jessica Biel, 40, said Hipgnosis "values artists and their creative work".
