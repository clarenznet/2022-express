Another truth Boris needs to ram home is that we actually don’t need train drivers any more. Why are these people being paid obscene amounts of money to drive trains that can be designed to drive themselves. But the real kick in the teeth for the British people here is that during the pandemic the taxpayer paid out £16B (£600 for every household in Britain) to keep the trains going even when they were empty and people were too scared to use them. And unlike other industries - no jobs were lost or even furloughed. Yet the RMT bosses show their gratitude for that by spitting on the British public and making their already difficult lives even harder. So Boris HAS to take them on because no union should have the power to bring the country to a standstill. The RMT has had it’s own way for too long so it’s time to say to Hell with its interests – it’s the interests of the British public that matter now. It’s also time hard facts were faced – that with advances in technology we don’t need the numbers of overpaid train drivers we currently have. Those drivers - who seem to have forgotten what solidarity is all about - need to think about THAT before they vote to plunge this country into chaos and turn an entire nation of working people against them.
