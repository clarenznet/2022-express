Invisible, high-energy ultraviolet (UV) rays can lead to photokeratitis – a type of sunburn to the outer layers of the cornea (the transparent part of the eye that covers the iris and pupil). Experts at Specsavers detailed the symptoms of photokeratitis, such as red, swollen eyes. Persistent exposure to UV light can increase the risk of cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and eyelid cancer. How to choose protective sunglasses You need to make sure your sunglasses have certified UV400 protection. Such sunnies are "the best choice to ensure your eyes are fully protected from sun damage".

"Fortunately the condition gets better by itself and there is usually no permanent damage," the experts noted. However, UV damage – as mentioned previously – can lead to cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and eyelid cancer. Cataracts The NHS explained cataracts are "cloudy patches" that can grow in size. They cause blurry and misty vision, eventually leading to blindness. Seek professional care with an optometrist if you experience any signs of cataracts. Signs of cataracts "If you wear glasses, you may feel your lenses are dirty and need cleaning, even when they do not," the NHS added. Cataracts progressively get worse over time, so surgery might be recommended to replace the affected lens. "Surgery is the only treatment that's proven to be effective for cataracts," the NHS certified. As well as injury to the eyes, smoking, diabetes, drinking too much alcohol and long-term use of steroids can contribute to cataracts.
