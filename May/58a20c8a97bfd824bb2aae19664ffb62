Shell and McDonald's announced plans to suspend business in Russia today, with the country continuing to sustain severe losses amid its invasion of Ukraine. The latter company has announced it will sell off its business in the country, citing Ukraine's humanitarian crisis. The fast food chain will cease business after becoming one of the first to operate in Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed 32 years ago.  The Mcdonald's announcement follows petrol giant Shell, which announced it would sell off its business last week. Executives sold off the Russian portion of their business to Lukoil for an undisclosed sum. Shell said: "Under this deal, more than 350 people currently employed by Shell Neft will transfer to the new owner of this business." McDonald's and Shell are a drop in the ocean of businesses that have curtailed their involvement with Russia since the invasion began.
