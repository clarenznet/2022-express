Kate was visiting the Shire Hall Care Home in Cardiff in August 2021 with her husband when the comment was made by one of the residents. Joan Drew-Smith, 87, pointed out the future Queen of England and asked William: “Is that your assistant?”  To which Kate replied with a laugh as she turned to the Duke: “Well, I am your assistant. “I have been for a long time!” The royal couple were visiting the care home in person after entertaining the residents virtually with a bingo game during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Kate and William read out the numbers via video link and returned to Shire Hall to ask if the residents had enjoyed the game.  When asking Joan Drew-Smith what she had made of the bingo, the Duke said to her: “Hello Joan, do you remember we did the bingo with you? “You said we weren’t very good!” Her answer made both Kate and William “roar with laughter”, according to The Mirror. She said: “Yes. You did a bloody sh***y job!”  READ MORE: Kate's 'calm and stabilising influence' won over royals Fellow care home resident Margaret Stocks, 95, who won the virtual bingo game, was much kinder to the royals.
