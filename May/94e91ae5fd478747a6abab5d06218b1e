This is the case even if the only available seats are on a rival airline. If the cancellation was announced with less than two weeks warning, passengers are entitled to compensation. easyJet has also cancelled around 30 flights daily, especially to and from its main base of Gatwick. easyJet is removing a row of seating from its planes to try to reduce the number of flight cancellations this summer. With 150 passengers the airline will be able to operate flights with three rather than four cabin crew. Issues could continue into the summer months as airlines struggle to recruit ahead of the peak period. It can take a very long time to recruit security staff due to the high number of checks required. Passengers are advised to travel to the airport early to make sure they beat security queues. Airlines may hold passengers responsible if they miss a flight due to being stuck in a long security queue. Tourists could try to call their airline or contact a member of staff if they believe they will miss their flight. They may be able to transfer onto a later flight for a fee or the plane may wait if many passengers are stuck in queues.
