Newcastle are reportedly looking to tempt Jose Mourinho into leaving AS Roma this summer despite the fact that Eddie Howe has been a hit. The Magpies could be set to splash the cash in the transfer window. Newcastle could sack Howe this summer and replace him with Mourinho, if they get their own way. That is despite the English coach having a huge impact in his short spell in charge. The Magpies are armed with a huge transfer budget ahead of the window opening at the end of the season. After already splashing the cash in January, further signings are planned to take the club to the next level. And Mourinho could be the man to lead them into their next era, according to Marca. The Special One has been linked with the post at St James Park in the past, prior to the appointment of Howe. The former Bournemouth boss joined in November, signing the likes of Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood and Bruno Guimaraes. And they have had an instant impact, pulling Newcastle out of relegation danger and solidifying their Premier League status. But being a mid-table club is not the ambition of the new owners on Tyneside and they have ultimately the biggest trophies in their sight. However, there might be a worry that Howe might not be the man to take them into that potential golden age - despite his heroics so far. Mourinho has a track record of winning silverware - though there is an argument his managerial prowess might be in decline. Nevertheless, the star factor would be a huge boost for the club alone as they look to assert themselves on the world stage. Former Premier League striker Darren Bent has already given his verdict, insisting it would be a great move by the Toon. “Newcastle is the only one where I’m looking at it and thinking it’s a match made in heaven,” he said. “They’ve got endless funds, he likes to spend money, I can imagine with the new owners being there, they’d look at his CV and like to appoint him.”
