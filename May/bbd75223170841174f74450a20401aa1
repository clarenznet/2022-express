In the UK, people can only vote in the following ways: The default voting method is in person, and anyone hoping to alter their arrangements will need to clear it with the Electoral Commission first. Most of those who successfully sign up for the local elections will vote in person at local ballot boxes. Registered people will receive a polling card in the post informing people where their nearest polling station is. While they don't need the card to post their vote, the station disclosed is the only one at which they can vote. Polling stations are open for 15 hours across the country, from 7am to 10pm. The timing should allow anyone to vote, regardless of when they start work for the day. Due to the remaining Covid risk, in-person voters will need to bring their own pen or pencil and wear a face covering. Anyone who contracts Covid on polling day or is otherwise unable to attend the station can apply for an emergency proxy vote until 5pm on May 5.
