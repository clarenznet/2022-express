Andrew Neil, 72, returns to the frontline of political journalism this evening with his new Channel 4 programme. ‘The Andrew Neil Show’ sees the veteran broadcaster grill politicians as he delves into the week’s biggest news stories. In the first instalment of the 10-part series, the presenter goes head-to-head with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency. Newspapers reported at the time how the “Bachelor of Fleet Street” had now finally tied the knot. Mr Neil earned the nickname after his many years spent as a single man. His wife Susan is a Swedish engineer, 20 years his junior, who worked at London-based engineering and environmental consultancy Waterman Group. The couple married in the south of France near Mr Neil’s villa, he confirmed in a series of tweets at the time. He said: “Secret is out! So I thought y'all might like a picture!” “But it means we have the waterfront to ourselves. There are no other competitors on at that time. “Sunday mornings are a bit crowded and there are other points in the schedule which have lots of political programming – breakfast time as well during the week. “We get this slot to ourselves.” The programme’s launch comes after the launch of new UK news stations GB News and TalkTV. Mr Neil claimed that his new programme would sit in between straight news and more comment-led content. He said: “It won’t be American-style, that’s for sure. And it won’t be shouty. “But I hope it will have some pace and some insight. Shouty can be quite entertaining, though it’s also a little bit exhausting after a while.” ‘The Andrew Neil Show’ airs on Channel 4 from 6pm today.
