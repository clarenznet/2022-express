Konstrakta, Serbia's entry, begins her song "In Corpore Sano" by repeating: "What could be the secret of Meghan Markle's healthy hair? What could it be?" In a Eurovision first, the song is performed in both Serbian and Latin. Discussing the song, Konstrakta said that Meghan isn't really important to the song but "she’s representative of all those people in the media that we’re focused on." Also competing tonight for a spot in Saturday's final are Finland, Israel, Australia, Ireland and Poland, among others. Russia has been banned from this year's competition, following its invasion of Ukraine. Eurovision's second semi-final will be on BBC Three at 8pm and is hosted by Rylan Clark and Scott Mills.
