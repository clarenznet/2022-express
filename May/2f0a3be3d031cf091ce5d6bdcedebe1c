Bond Girl Ursula Andress, 86, stunned in unearthed behind-the-scenes photographs from the 1965 film, She. In the sensational stills, the Swiss actress can be seen looking fierce in a gown and headdress featuring gold details. The fabulous outfit featured feathers all over and cinched Ursula’s slim waist. Ursula’s long, blonde locks were mostly covered by the head piece, while her features were accentuated by a smokey eye and light makeup. In the adventure film, Ursula portrays an immortal queen who rules the lost city of Kuma in central-east Africa. Ursula had her film breakthrough as Bond Girl Honey Ryder in the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962). She later starred as Vesper Lynd in the 1967 Bond parody Casino Royale.
