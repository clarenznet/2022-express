Jodie Comer, 29, most known for playing Villanelle in BBC's Killing Eve, brought sophisticated glamour to the BAFTA TV Awards today. The actress stunned in a black gown which featured a rather low neckline and a daringly-high split up the front of the garment. The black, suit-styled gown featured pockets and buttons which were barely done up, as they left the star's ample assets on full display. The gown only included three buttons leaving a large split in the middle of the dress, displaying Jodie's toned pins. She accompanied the outfit with silver jewellery and black stiletto platform heels. In order to not detract attention away from the dress, Jodie went for a slick hair look tucked behind her ears with her blonde tresses falling down her back. She went for a simple makeup look, including a bronzed blush, so no attention was taken away from the statement gown. The Virgin Media BAFTA TV Awards recognises the television highlights viewers enjoyed in 2021, with hit, critically acclaimed shows including Itâ€™s A Sin, We Are Lady Parts, Landscapers, Help and Time leading the nominations. The star-studded ceremony is being held at the Royal Festival Hall in London today.
