Police were called to the south London property owned by the Prime Minister after the Vauxhall Astra ploughed into the front garden at around 1am on Monday. The smash caused damage to a wall, hedge and tree. Neighbours described being woken by a "loud bang" and a sound like "thunder". The incident prompted speculation on the street in Camberwell about whether the vehicle careering into the front of the three-storey house was deliberate, but police said no offences were identified. One neighbour told The Times: “I think it was deliberate. I mean why else this particular house?” But other neighbours said the road had recently been used by speeding drivers as a rat run. The driver suffered a minor injury but did not need to go to hospital. The car was towed away at around 5pm.
