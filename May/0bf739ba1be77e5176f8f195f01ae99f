Brit actress and former Bond girl Gemma Arterton exuded absolute glamour as she hit the red carpet of Sky's Up Next event at London's Theatre Royal yesterday. She obligingly turned to the side for the cameras to showcase the exquisite tailoring of her stunning floor length backless dress. The style, which was cut to just above her derriere, revealed her tiny, toned waist, while her jet black hair coordinated perfectly with the dramatic black gown. She also sported an eye-catching bejewelled choker which tied at the back with a long trailing chain. Meanwhile, she opted for a vintage bob hair style with elegant flicks curling up around her chin. Gemma is set to star in a new flick called Freegard, based on the real-life story of con-man Robert Freegard. She will star as the woman who brings him to justice. The King's Man star Gemma is already channelling her femme fatale looks on the red carpet in preparation for the movie's later release.
