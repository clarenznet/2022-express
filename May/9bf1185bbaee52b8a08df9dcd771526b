Bill Gannon has worked as a community artist for 40 years, often in areas where the iconic graffiti murals have appeared. He was elected to represent Pembroke Dock on Pembrokeshire Council but stepped down, blaming frequent harassment over the rumour. Bill said in his resignation letter: "An allegation has been repeatedly made that I am not who I say I am but that I am the artist Banksy. "This allegation is undermining my ability to do the work. Therefore, I have decided to step down." He wears an I Am Not Banksy badge to try to distance himself from the anonymous artist, who is widely thought to be linked to Bristol. Bill added: "In the past [I] was doing much the same as Banksy in the same areas and cities at the same time. "There were thousands of us at it. If I am Banksy then everyone is Banksy. "It was felt that the council did not really need another controversial councillor so I did the decent thing and stood down." He alleged that the claims were started by an ex-councillor. A Banksy mural did appear on a garage in Port Talbot, 65 miles to the east of Pembroke Dock, in 2018. It was removed earlier this year.
