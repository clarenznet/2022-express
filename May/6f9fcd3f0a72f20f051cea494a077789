Some 20,800 have come to the UK under the family scheme, and 33,000 as part of the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship. Overall, there have been around 128,100 applications for visas. These include 43,700 under the family scheme, of which 38,700 visas were granted, and 84,400 applications under the homes sponsorship, of which 68,700 visas have been given. Homes for Ukraine in particular has faced criticism over long waits and the figures suggest over half with a visa have still not reached the UK. Charities have urged visas to be waived with some criticising the schemes as "not fit for purpose". Government officials believe some people who applied are staying near Ukraine so they can return home sooner, or have since changed their minds. Refugees Minister Lord Harrington said the schemes are the "fastest and biggest in UK history". He added: "We are doing all we can to support new arrivals."
