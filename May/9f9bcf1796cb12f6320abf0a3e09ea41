In some quarters it's possible to imagine the Odesa of old, a holiday town that usually welcomes Russian tourists about now. But this year is different. It's no Mariupol or Kharkiv, but Odesa continues to be a target for Moscow. Russia is using long-range missile strikes to attack the city. Last month, several people, including a mother and her baby, were killed. In the most recent attack on Monday, at least three people were injured as a tourist hotel was targeted. If Moscow were to occupy the port, it would control the entire Black Sea coast and cut Ukraine off from overseas trade. Russia has blockaded Odesa, while deploying its Black Sea submarine fleet with cruise missiles. Russian-speaking Odesa would clearly be a prized possession, but Moscow would first have to conquer another city 82 miles east. Mykolaiv is seen as the gateway to Odesa and has been bombarded daily. Russian troops have already occupied Kherson, 40 miles away from Mykolaiv.  But compared with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, the level and methods of attacks have changed. Moscow is now capable of firing cruise missiles from 62 miles away. Ukrainian soldier Petro said: "In 2014, this used to be a war of trenches. Now the attacks come from everywhere. Everywhere is the front line." While the Kremlin may want Odesa eventually, the city's mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov, tells residents to remain alert and trust in the Ukrainian military. He says: "Keep calm, believe in the armed forces of Ukraine and the defence forces, work for the benefit of the country's economy, follow all the recommendations of the mayor's office and the military administration."
