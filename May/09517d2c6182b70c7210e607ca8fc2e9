However, many were turned away and told to go home because their flights were cancelled. Is this because it's cheaper for tour companies to cancel the entire holiday rather than pay compensation to passengers for delayed flights? The news that animal-like French police thugs tear-gassed innocent children in the appalling scenes in Paris is a disgusting revelation, says Ian McNicholas, from Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent. The French government should hang its head in shame about these disgraceful attacks by these uniformed minions, and their attempts to blame the peaceful Liverpool fans. Every British citizen should boycott France as a holiday destination, and all French products. Liverpool were allocated 19,618 tickets for the Champions League final so can anyone explain why 60,000 Liverpool fans, according to the media, were heading to Paris?, asks John Cherry, from Chatham, Kent. What were they going for if they didn't have tickets for the game? It does not make any sense nor help the image of English football. After the appalling behaviour of French police thugs at the Champions League final it will be interesting to see what sanctions Uefa impose on the French due to their incompetence, says Graham Partington, from Liverpool. Typical of them, just as with the Channel, they couldn't organise a knees-up in a frogs' legs factory.
