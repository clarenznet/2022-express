Terra Luna investors saw their assets wiped last week when LUNA unexpectedly hit rock bottom. The once top-performing cryptocurrency haemorrhaged value on May 12 and has since struggled to make even modest gains. Other tokens have had a very different experience, and five have made gains over the last week. Tether (USDT) currently ranks behind Bitcoin and Ethereum on the exchange platform CoinMarketCap. The established coin saw its value crater as the crash hit the market on May 12, dropping from $0.9968 (£0.80) to $0.9704 (£0.78). But it regained its momentum almost as quickly as it vanished and exceeded its pre-crash value on the same day, reaching $0.9972. Tether has since hit its highest value since May 11, valued at $0.999 as of May 18. READ MORE: Will crypto go back up? Experts 'optimistic' USD Coin founders pegged their stablecoin directly to the US dollar and managed to capitalise on the falling market. On May 12, it surged from $1.0005 to $1.0079, a comparatively stratospheric high for the coin. The price is the highest USD Coin hit in 2022 so far, but still distant from its all-time high. USDC, among the younger coins on the market, hit $1.0284 in 2021. Another US dollar token, Binance USD, also provided a counterweight to Terra Luna on May 12. While its fellow stablecoin-pegged coin fell into a chasm, Binance USD hit its highest value in a year. In the early hours of May 12, it was worth $1.0034, and after Terra Luna failed, it hit $1.0204. The coin has since lost some of its value but remains above support levels, selling for $0.9994 each.

The token has since exceeded its pre-crash price and continues to gather momentum. As of May 18, people can buy XMR for $171.80 (£138.45), and recent data shows positive movement has sustained since May 15. While encouraging for investors, the coin still has some ways to go until it hits its $226.04 (£182.16) May high. Dai (DAI) followed a similar trajectory to USDC and Binance Coin as it made gains following the crash. In the hours before LUNA met its fate, the coin sold for roughly $0.9976 apiece. The market crash appeared to boost the coin back past the dollar mark to $1.0046. DAI is another less valuable coin but has stayed consistent around the $1 mark since its debut in 2019.
