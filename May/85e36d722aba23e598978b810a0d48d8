Sri Lanka, an island in the Indian Ocean, is facing its worst economic crisis since independence, with acute shortages of food and fuel. This has resulted in protests taking place between pro-government supporters and those calling for a regime change. The government has now ordered troops to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing "harm to life". Police say eight people have died and one hospital has reported more than 200 wounded people. Sri Lankan troops conducted an operation to rescue Mr Rajapaksa, who resigned on Monday, for his removal to an undisclosed location in a desperate bid for safety. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
