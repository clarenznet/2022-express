Heidi Klum, 48, slipped her svelte figure into a clingy two-piece mesh gnome-print set by Belgian fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck, worn over a bikini that showed off her long legs and trim waist. The former runway sensation was also seen planting multiple kisses on her guitarist husband Tom Kaulitz, 32. Klum was seen strutting her stuff in a video posted to her Stories, in view of her followers, that featured what appeared to be a rooftop parking structure. The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover girl paired her trendy look with a navy Tiësto baseball cap, and tagged the Dutch DJ's music in her multiple social media posts. The blonde beauty wore her tresses in a straight style, cascading down her shoulders. She shielded her eyes from the sun with a pair of dark aviators, and accessorised with a black shoulder bag and boots.
