The backlog in cases hit 1.2 million and is still at around 300,000, causing misery for new drivers and those trying to renew their licence. Conservative MP David Jones described it as “outrageous”. He added: “The perception of the DVLA is at rock bottom. “There are people across the country bitterly inconvenienced. If we were talking about payments to MPs the country would be up in arms. “The country will also be up in arms that £2million of bonuses are being handed out to people who have let them down so badly.” Department for Transport records show £2,163,414 was paid in non-consolidated bonuses for 2021/22. The DVLA defended the additional funds as part of a civil service-wide recognition scheme. A spokesman said it receives 60,000 items of mail daily and added: “Our staff have worked incredibly hard to help keep the country moving throughout the pandemic and, despite a number of issues including coordinated industrial action, our services are operating within normal turnaround times. “Paper applications are being processed within three to four weeks.”
