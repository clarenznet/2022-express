It is believed a group of mourners, who had been drinking, caused a disturbance at the wake in Towyn, north Wales, and public safety became threatened. A witness saw 23 police officers arrive in 12 patrol cars but the constabulary said it acknowledged the sensitivity of the situation. A North Wales Police spokesperson said: "We were called yesterday (Tuesday) to reports of disorder in the Towyn area. On attendance, officers encountered a large number of people who had been drinking following a funeral earlier in the day. "Whilst we are sensitive to this being a difficult time, we are committed to maintaining public safety, and subsequently, three males were arrested for various public order offences. Our investigations into this incident are currently ongoing." Photographs taken last night and published by North Wales Live show multiple officers line a street and face a gathering of people by several buildings, including a fish and chip shop and a pub. Several police cars are also pictured in the images.  Residents in Towyn, a popular seaside resort, reported hearing sirens and see people "kick off" and "brawl" in the street. A number of businesses in the area closed early because they feared of the trouble in the town, it is understood. No further details regarding the wake, such as whom was being mourned, have been disclosed. Police are also yet to confirm information about those arrested, including the ages of the suspects.
