Katy Perry put on a risqué display as she attended yesterday's Met Gala in an asymmetric, black and white design. The Daisy hitmaker's dress perfectly fitted the event's Gilded Glamour and White Tie theme as the daring nature of the garment sent jaws-dropping. Katy was all smiles as she graced the red carpet in her custom made Oscar de la Renta gown. The star had slipped into a structured white mini dress which featured a long, ruched black train and sheer overlay across her chest. But one side of the garment proved to be more interesting than the rest. A lace section covered the singer's left boob leaving little to the imagination.
