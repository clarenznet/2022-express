   The legendary rock band are due to kick off their tour at Metropolitano Stadium tomorrow, and they all appear to be in high spirits. Mick, 78, was all smiles as he was seen being driven to the venue by a masked-up driver. The lead singer was wearing what appeared to be a dusty pink jacket, a light brown scarf and a dark v-neck jumper over a patterned white shirt. Keith, 78, was pictured with wife Patti Hansen, 66, as they were captured walking along the street.  The rocker wore a black rimmed hat, black trousers and a black leather jacket with black and green patterned scarf. Patti matched her husband in a black maxi dress, decorated with golden sequins at the bottom. She also wore a black leather jacket, and completed the look with some chunky black boots. Ronnie, 74, was also there with family in tow, wearing a dark grey zip-up hoodie over a maroon shirt, with a white T-shirt layered beneath it.  He kept it casual with some loose-fit black trousers and some trainers. The Stones' Sixty Tour was announced back in March and set to start off in Madrid, before concluding almost two months later in Stockholm, Sweden. This will be the bandâ€™s first European tour without drummer Charlie Watts following his death in August 2021.
