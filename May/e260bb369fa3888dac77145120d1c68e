Mohamed Salah "needs Liverpool" as much as they need him, according to former Chelsea left-back Scott Minto. The pundit says he would consider leaving Salah, who's out of contract at Anfield at the end of next season, out of his starting XI for the Champions League final against Real Madrid on Saturday.

First half of the season he was the best player on the planet. "Second half of the season, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane for me, better." Salah held a press conference this week where he refused to speak about his contract situation but only confirmed he would not be leaving this summer. He said: "In my mind, I don't focus on the contract. I don't want to be selfish at all. I said two months ago it's about the team. It's an important week for us. "I'm just focused on the team and winning the Champions League again. I want to see Hendo [Jordan Henderson] with the trophy in the hands and hopefully he gives it to me. I don't want to talk about the contract now, I'm staying next season for sure, that's clear."  Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport?
