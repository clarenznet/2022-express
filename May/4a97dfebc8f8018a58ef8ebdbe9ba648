The westbound carriageway is shut from junction 26 for Bradford, West Yorkshire, and junction 25 for Brighouse in the same county. The eastbound carriageway was also shut between the two junctions but reopened at around 6am, following the pile-up which said to have happened at around 4.20am. Inrix, the traffic information service, said: "M62 Westbound closed, queueing traffic due to accident at J25 A644 Wakefield Road (Brighouse). The Eastbound side has now reopened with lanes two and three (of three) still closed. The Westbound side remains closed. The road has been closed since around 04:30 Tuesday morning." Posting on Twitter at 4.45am,Â National Highways Yorkshire said: "Lanes 1 is now open on the #M62 eastbound within J25 near #Brighouse due to a multi vehicle collision. Lanes 2 and 3 remain closed for recovery and clean up. Traffic on the westbound carriageway is still being diverted via the exit and entry slip roads." There was no more information immediately available on the circumstances surrounding the collision, Yorkshire Live says. But queues remain severe from before junction 26 on the westbound side. Drivers are being diverted off at junction 26 and onto local roads in Brighouse to rejoin the motorway. Eastbound traffic is still slow although the road is open. It's congested from junction 24 for Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. No diversions are in place but some motorists are leaving at junction 24 to go through Elland, West Yorkshire, and neighbouring Brighouse to rejoin the motorway at junction 25. The crash involved several vehicles, and one of which reportedly smashed through the central reservation. It is unclear if anyone has been hurt in the accident.
