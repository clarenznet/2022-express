James Hargreaves, 31, arrived in Paris on Thursday at around 9am with his 66-year-old dad, who has the same name - but goes by Jimmy. The pair were in the city ahead of the final game tomorrow, where Liverpool will play Real Madrid. The 31-year-old, from Norris Green, said he last saw his dad near Lush Bar on Rue des Dames at around 1.40am today. James said his dad went missing between the venue and the Novotol Suited Paris Montreuil Vincennes hotel, where they are staying. James said his dad does not have a mobile phone and has "no idea where we are staying." The 31-year-old said he has spoken to police in Paris and checked nearby bars. Posting on Twitter, he wrote: "Any reds out and about in Paris, my dad has vanished. We’re staying at Novotol Montreuil Vincennes, can’t find him. Any help. Message us, cheers."  James is urging LFC fans to keep an eye out for his dad and to contact him if anyone spots him. He told the Liverpool Echo: "Just to keep an eye out, he’s a sound fella and will talk to anyone, his name's Jimmy."   Jimmy is 66-year-old has grey hair, a beard and was wearing a green coat and red t-shirt. Since sharing his tweet appealing for people to help find his dad, James has had hundreds of messages of support. The 66-year-old was last seen around ten hours ago.
