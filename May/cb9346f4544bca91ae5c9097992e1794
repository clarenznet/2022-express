Newlyweds Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and Nicola Peltz, 27, coordinated their outfits, as they both donned shades of pink to the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday. The couple both sported plunging necklines, with Brooklyn wearing a pale blush suit which flashed his bare chest. David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son paired the suit with white trainers and layered gold necklaces. He proudly gazed at his new wife, who turned heads in a hot pink Valentino gown. Nicola’s bardot dress had a low-cut neckline which went all the way down to her navel. She added some glamour with a long train which trailed on the floor behind her as she walked. The Met Gala theme this year was ‘Gilded Glamour and White Tie’, referencing the lavish era of American fashion in the last decades of the 19th century. Other stars in attendance included Kim Kardashian, who wore Marilyn Monroe’s iconic bedazzled dress, which the actress famously wore to sing Happy Birthday to President John F. Kennedy. Hosts for the evening were Anna Wintour, Blake Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds, alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda and Regina King.
