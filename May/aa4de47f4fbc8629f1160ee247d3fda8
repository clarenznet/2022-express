Sara Cox, 47, has taken to Twitter to show off her new muscular physique after taking part in fitness challenges. The radio presenter credited Rylan Clark for her gym honed look after she took inspiration from his "results". 6PackRevolution posted a picture of Sara to their Twitter page as she posed showing off her muscles. They captioned the picture: "Incredible final results photo from BBC2 radio presenter @djsaracox who just completed the March wave of The Six Pack Revolution. "YASSSS girl. In her own words: 'Pretty chuffed that I cracked it aged 47. Recommend it massively if you want to have a go'." (sic) Sara replied in view of her 860,800 followers: "Loved it feel fit n strong saw @Rylan’s results & thought 'oooh I’ll have me a bit of that please'!" (sic) Rylan couldn't help but join in and share the moment, as he replied: "So proud of u. Stunner xxxx @sarajcox." (sic) Sara is referring to Rylan's transformation at the beginning of this year as he posted his results from working with The Six Pack Revolution. The television personality credited the "life-changing" exercise and nutrition, helping him after his split from his husband of six years, Dan Neal. He said at the time: "My attitude to exercise has done a complete u-turn. "Not only has my body transformed but my mental health has massively improved too, I’m literally a new man! "I’ve always worried about taking this step but it really has improved me for the better," he said on a statement released at the time.
