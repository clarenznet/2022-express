Sweden and Finland have officially launched their bids to join NATO, following more than a month of lock-step communication from the Nordic countries. While not approved or fully paid up yet, their addition to the alliance would add two powerful European nations to its ranks and promises to pile new pressure on Vladimir Putin's Russian regime. The Kremlin has warned their entry would demand security rearrangements in Eastern Europe and threatened to move its nuclear deterrent to Finland's doorstep. Moscow's warning stipulates that it would deploy tactical nuclear weapons "when NATO bases appear in Sweden and Finland". The statement, which came after the two nations announced their respective bids on Monday, already marked a departure from previous threats that Russia would deploy the weapons on their entry to the organisation. And it will have led to questions about the country's capabilities, especially given its trouble in Ukraine.

SIPRI estimates the Kremlin had an arsenal of 6,255 warheads in 2021, more than every NATO country combined. The alliance has 6,065 from its relatively small clutch of nuclear-capable nations, with most of NATO's supply provided by the US, which has 3,750. Ground troops and vehicles have formed the bulk of Russia's invading force in Ukraine, as the country has funnelled in units over the border since February. Compared to NATO, Russia is significantly outmatched in this department, as the western alliance has nearly four times more troops. Russia has approximately 1,350,000 troops, while NATO has an estimated 5,405,700.  The picture is more mixed when figures factor in ground combat vehicles, as Russian production has given the country an artillery edge, with 6,574 self-propelled artillery, 7,571 tower artillery and 3,391 self-propelled rocket launchers. NATO has 5,040, 5,495 and 2,803 in comparison, but leads in battle tanks and armoured vehicles, with 14,682 and 115,855 respectively, to Russia's 12,420 and 30,122. While he has an artillery advantage, recent military intelligence from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has suggested its command structure is in disarray. The department said Putin fired tank commander Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel "for his failure to capture Kharkiv".  Russia is outmatched in every air force category compared to NATO. Moscow has roughly 4,173 jets, composed of 772 fighters, 739 ground attack aircraft, 445 transport aircraft, 20 tanker aircraft and 132 specialised units used for tasks like reconnaissance. NATO has nearly five times as many units, with 20,723, 3,527 of which are fighters, 1,048 ground attack craft, 543 transporters, 678 tankers and 1,048 special units. The alliance also has 8,485 helicopters to Russia's 1,543.  Again, Russia is at a disadvantage in the ocean when looking at official naval unit figures. The country has 605 overall, split between destroyers, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers, submarines, patrol boats and minesweepers. The total is likely lower now as Russia lost the Moskova - the flagship of its Black Sea fleet - to Ukrainian missile strikes in April, prompting Putin to fire its commander Vice-Admiral Igor Osipov, the MoD update added. NATO has 2,049 across the same categories, including 17 aircraft carriers to Russia's one.
