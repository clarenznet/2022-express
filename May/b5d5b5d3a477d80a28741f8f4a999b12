Appearing as a hi-tech Abbatar, the songwriter, 77, is back on stage with his bandmates this week after more than 40 years away. But the Swedish maestro says that despite fan adoration, 400 million records sold and 17 number ones, theVoyage project is something he is finally proud of. The Grammy winner revealed how the band's magic returned in less than a minute as they recorded new material for the first time since 1982. However, he admits that Abba are not going to reunite for real, as it is "too much hassle" to be "geriatric pop stars". Abba'sVoyage avatars, accompanied by a 10-piece live band, will be launched at the custombuilt Abba Arena in London from Friday. The show is expected to be a commercial success - but Ulvaeus said it's a personal one, too. He explained: "I am always plagued by a bad self-consciousness, unsure of myself, and writing [Voyage] has made me a better songwriter and lyricist and made me believe in myself more. It has given me creatively a lot lately I am feeling confident." Reuniting to make music after settling on the pioneering avatar idea was "very emotional" for all four members, he said. He told Sirius' NPR radio: "Benny [Andersson] and I thought now that we have these avatars why don't we write a couple of new songs for them.We called the ladies and asked if they were up to recording again. And they said, 'Of course'."  Describing the studio sessions, Ulvaeus said: "It was really great fun.The last time we did that was in winter 1982.We wrote these songs and it was such great fun to be together in the studio again. It was all four of us like before. "It took 15 seconds or half a minute to come back into 1982 again. It was very emotional. "You suddenly realise, the bond that we have, the things we had done and what we had together is incredible, especially in view of the fact that we thought a couple of years after we split up we would be forgotten. "And here we are. And we have a reason to be here.That was just amazing."
