I started school 70 years ago and was presented with the magnificent book Elizabeth Our Queen, written by journalist and broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. I treasured it and have kept it, feeling privileged to be part of her long reign. This Platinum Jubilee year is an unsurpassed celebration of a wonderful life dedicated to Royal duty and family, past, present and future. My book ends with a toast and the words still appropriate today, of everlasting hope, "So let it be." Is it just me, or is everyone else sick to death of this court case being fought out by Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy?, asks Trevor Buckle, from Lichfield. It's like watching two cats fighting over a piece of meat. Get over it girls, grow up. You are both privileged to have husbands who earn copious amounts of money for you to spend. Life is too short, get on with it. Who cares? I don't. What an FA Cup final.What a shame it was spoilt by thousands of moronic Liverpool supporters who insulted PrinceWilliam, the Royal Family and our Queen by booing the National Anthem, says Rod Williams, from Great Holland, Essex. Let's hope classy Manchester City win the Premier League and then Real Madrid thrash them in the Champions League final. Wow! We came second in the Eurovision Song Contest instead of our usual "nul points", says Graham Douglas, from Chatham, Kent. This can only be down to one major factor, namely the "Boris effect". Boris's unrivalled support for Ukraine has shaken Europe to the core. Let's hope that ultimately this support leads to victory in Ukraine.
