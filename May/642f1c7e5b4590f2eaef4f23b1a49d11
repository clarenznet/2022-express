Lifeguards were able to intervene and save the life of the tourist who had entered cardiorespiratory arrest whilst swimming in the sea. The 70-year-old man was taken to the Son Espases hospital in a serious condition. The incident took place at around 1.30 pm.   A lifeguard spotted a man floating some 30 metres from the shore and immediately went to get him, at the same time alerting the rest of his colleagues and the emergency teams. On bringing the man to shore, they found he had no pulse and began cardiorespiratory resuscitation until the man was able to regain a pulse.  They placed him in a lateral position while he received oxygen from the equipment carried by the lifeguards. Minutes later, two ambulances, local police officers from Calvià and members of the Civil Protection and Emergency services of the municipality arrived. The medical staff intubated the tourist and transferred him in serious condition to the Son Espases hospital, where he was admitted.
