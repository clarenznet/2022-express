Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor looked incredible as she departed The Mark Hotel prior to attending the Met Gala at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday. The actress, 27, flashed her bra beneath a sheer black mini dress featuring a mesh train that exhibited her legs. The on-screen star showcased her toned frame as she posed for pictures ahead of the big event. The Bridgerton star kept her auburn tresses in loose waves as she waved to the cameras. The full-length sheer gown dropped to the floor and featured layered tulle accompanied by a tutu. The beauty rocked bold makeup and accessorised her look with diamond earrings. The Met Gala’s 2022 dress code is "Gilded Glamour and White Tie”. Other guests at the star-studded event included Anna Wintour, Sophie Turner, Vanessa Hudgens and Blake Lively. Celebrity attendees have brought their own interpretations to the dress code this evening at the annual event, which is being held in New York City at The Met as usual, which references the extravagant era of American fashion in the last decades of the 19th century.
