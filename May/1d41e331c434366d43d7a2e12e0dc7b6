Maksimov Sergey Viktorovich, commander of the 138th separate motor-shooting brigade of the sixth general military army of the Russian Federation, is suspected of attempted murder and of war crimes. Prosecutors of the Kharkiv regional prosecutor's office and investigators found that, on March 26, he ordered shell the villages of Malaya Rogan and Vilkhivka to be shelled by a TOS-1 Pinocchio despite knowing that there were no military targets in these villages. A 13-year-old girl died from the injuries she sustained in the attack. Meanwhile, an adviser to Ukraine's president has warned of Russian progress in the Donbas region. Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia's "army is having some tactical success which is threatening to become an operational success in the direction of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk".
