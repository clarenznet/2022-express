A Japanese coastguard later confirmed the missile had fallen into the Sea of Japan.  South Korean and US intelligence officials are understood to be analysing the circumstances around the launch.

Saturday's launch comes just days after another ballistic missile test by North Korea on Wednesday. It marks the fourteenth missile launch just this year, including one that is believed to have been unsuccessful in March.  The launches just this year show a huge increase, as the country conducted only four tests in 2020, and eight in 2021.   Social media users jokingly said the North Korean leader was looking "for attention" now the concentration seems to be on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. User StevieO, tweeted: "Kim is just mad that little Vlad is getting all the attention when it comes to threatening humanity with a nuclear apocalypse." Another replied: "Doesn't mean he's not dangerous". User RufusDryer commented: "Threats are the currency of dictators, that’s how they hold onto power at home. But threats don’t determine what other countries do. The bottom line is that the use of nukes would end the life of a dictator and his support mechanism. So….will he or won’t he?" Another simply called Kim Jong-un's decision to launch the missiles "crazy".
