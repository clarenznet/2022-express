The drastic measures will pull the plug on BBC Four and CBBC as conventional linear TV channels screening programmes in specific time slots, in line with the broadcaster's plans to become "digital-first". Additionally, BBC World News and BBC News Channel will merge to create a single 24-hour TV news channel serving both UK and international audiences.Regional TV news programmes in Oxford and Cambridge are also among the services being scrapped - merging with the BBC's Southampton and Norwich operations respectively.The BBC did not confirm whether BBC Four, as well as CBBC and Radio 4 Extra, would eventually move online to the iPlayer service.Speaking to staff yesterday (Thursday) director-general Mr Davie said: "This is our moment to build a digital-first BBC. Something genuinely new, a Reithian organisation for the digital age, a positive force for the UK and the world."Independent, impartial, constantly innovating and serving all. A fresh, new, global digital media organisation which has never been seen before."Driven by the desire to make life and society better for our licence fee payers and customers in every corner of the UK and beyond.”He explained: “They want us to keep the BBC relevant and fight for something that in 2022 is more important than ever."To do that we need to evolve faster and embrace the huge shifts in the market around us." The first phase of savings totals £500 million in annual savings and reinvestment, £200 million of which will go towards bridging the £285 million annual funding shortfall by 2027/28 resulting from culture minster Nadine Dorries’ decision to freeze the cost of a licence at £159, its current level. The remaining gap will be covered in the final three years of the charter period.The corporation has already undergone a series of rounds of redundancies and cuts over the past decade prompted by below-inflation increases in the licence fee.Mr Davie, who took over from Lord Tony Hall as BBC director-general in September 2020, has overseen a slimming down of the corporation since starting in the role, with the BBC losing some 1,200 staff in the last 18 months.BBC Four, which is home to BBC Proms, BBC Young Dancer and BBC Young Musician, was launched in 2002, traditionally showing mainly arts and documentary programmes, plus international dramas. However, the corporation last year announced it would become the "home" of archived content and that it would broadcast fewer original programmes.Philippa Childs, head of broadcasting union Bectu, said: "We recognise the need for organisations to change and adapt and welcome the BBC's commitment to step up to the challenges of a changing media landscape and build a digital-first corporation. "However, once again we see the impact of poorly judged political decisions on workers as the Government's decision to freeze the licence fee has instigated these real-term job cuts.She added: “Bectu will fully engage in every aspect of these proposals and we will be doing everything we can to support our members. We will be working to ensure that change is not cost cutting for the sake of it, but truly does position the BBC strongly for the future and delivers the best possible outcomes for members." Also speaking yesterday, Ms Dorries issued the BBC with a legal direction ordering it to "promote equality of opportunity" for people from working-class backgrounds.The stipulation came as part of the mid-term review into its royal charter and includes a target for 25 per cent of staff to be from low socio-economic backgrounds and ensuring 50 per cent of radio and 60 per cent of TV programme production spend is outside London by the end of 2027.The BBC is also being required to deliver 1,000 apprenticeships per year by 2025 and ensure that 30 per cent of those are from low socio-economic groups.Speaking to Parliament’s DCMS committee last week, Ms Dorries said a consultation about the future funding of the broadcaster would begin imminently.
