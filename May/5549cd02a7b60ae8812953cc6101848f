Richard Osman, 51, and his partner Ingrid Oliver, 45, made their red carpet debut at the BAFTA Television Awards 2022. The couple looked loved up and beamed at each other as they arrived at the star-studded event at London’s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday. The presenter shared a romantic snap of the pair to his 1.1 million Twitter followers today. Richard looked dapper in a black tuxedo with silk lapels and matching tie. He gazed down at Ingrid, who looked glamorous in a long-sleeved black dress with a tiered skirt. The actress, best known for her roles in Watson & Oliver and The Hustle, wore her brunette hair in an updo and accessorised with a pair of tassel earrings. Richard captioned the post: “Happiness at the BAFTAs with @ingrid_oliver.” His show, House Of Games, was nominated for the Daytime award. However, it lost out to ITV’s The Chase. The event marked the first time Richard and Ingrid have walked a red carpet together since beginning their relationship last year.
