The 54-year-old was detained at Wandsworth Prison upon his sentencing on April 30. But his lawyer has reportedly told journalists that the former world no.1 that he had been transferred to HMP Huntercombe in Oxfordshire. According to The Times, the German national’s lawyer reportedly told journalists in Berlin on Tuesday: “Boris Becker was transferred to Huntercombe prison today. It is a category C prison, which means it has a low security level.” In April, Becker was found guilty of four charges by a jury at Southwark Crown Court and faced a maximum seven-year sentence. He was given a two-and-a-half-year sentence. At the time of sentencing, Becker's barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court that his client’s career had been ‘left in tatters’. He said: "Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy. These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income."
