Our Yorkshire Farm was last seen for its fifth season in November 2022 on Channel 5. Amanda and the rest of the Owen clan will be returning for a sixth season, as confirmed by the channel. However, as of yet, there has been no indication as to when Our Yorkshire Farm will be returning to the small screen. With no new series airing, there is another way to get your Yorkshire Shepherdess fix. Replying to Amanda's Instagram post which focused on lambing, Karan wrote: "Gorgeous family...hope we get to see you all again soon.... amazing lady..." Maureen commented: "Any word of a new series Amanda?" Whereas Rich-selena2003 added: "Please tell me there is going to be another series coming soon? I am missing you and your beautiful family." Our Yorkshire Farm is available to watch on My5.
