The ewe was rescued by the RSPCA from halfway down a cliff face, which runs under a coastal path near Kingsbridge in Devon. The RSPCA said it was thought that she had either followed her lamb over the edge or been forced there by a dog. However, given that there was no lamb found nearby, the latter explanation is believed to be more likely. A farmer called the animal welfare charity after someone spotted the sheep stuck halfway down the cliff. They deployed an eight-strong rescue team and said the ewe was facing the "harrowing prospect" of falling 50-metres to the beach below. Over the course of several hours, the team managed to push the ewe further up the cliff and then catch her. She was walked back over the edge, checked over, and then put back in her field. Thankfully, she was unharmed by the misadventure - which happened on April 29, Somerset Live reports. RSPCA chief inspector Richard Abbott, who led the rescue team, said: "I'm so relieved we were able to help this stranded sheep; as she faced a harrowing prospect of falling a huge distance to the ground. She was hopelessly stranded. "Our very patient rescue team accessed the ewe by abseiling down the cliff and over several hours were able to guide her to higher points, before she was caught and guided to a nearby field.  "Thankfully, we had no welfare concerns about the ewe despite her obvious ordeal and she could be released in the field straight away - after a job really well done by our specially trained team, who I am so proud of. "Livestock worrying remains a real problem in rural areas. While we cannot be sure, it seems very possible this ewe became stranded after being spooked or scared by a dog. That's why it is so important that dog owners don't let their pets off the lead when near to sheep, lambs and other livestock."
