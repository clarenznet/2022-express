Alessandra Ambrosio, 41, stunned in a white ball gown this evening as she posed on the red carpet at Cannes. The supermodel dazzled in the gown which featured silver detailing just about covering her ample assets. To stop a near wardrobe malfunction, the silver parts of the dress were held up by a see-through mesh top. Making sure not to take attention away from the top of the dress, Alessandra went for a simple but elegant look with a white puffy skirt. She added white silk gloves to the elegant ensemble and accessorised with a matching silver necklace and earrings. The Victoria's Secret model swept her brunette tresses back into a slick bun. She also opted for a subtle makeup look, making sure not to distract from her incredible outfit. The 75th Cannes Film Festival is well underway and celebrity guests arrived for the screening of Armageddon Time on Thursday, which stars Anne Hathaway, Anthony Hopkins and Succession star Jeremy Strong. Yesterday the Top Gun cast took to the red carpet in France for a screening, and now have jetted to Leicester Square for the London premiere.
