Russia claimed that its forces used sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles to take out a "large batch" of weapons stored in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry claimed: "High-precision long-range sea-based Kalibr missiles destroyed a large batch of weapons and military equipment near the Malin railway station in Zhytomyr region delivered from the United States and European countries".  it is not entirely clear where exactly the weapons were from, but the UK has provided over 5,000 anti-tank missiles, 120 armoured vehicles, and over 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives, among other shipments of equipment and weapons. This comes as Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, calls for Russia to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine once the war is over. Mr Zelensky, on the third anniversary of his taking the presidential office, said Moscow's attacks were designed to destroy all parts of Ukraine's infrastructure. He said: "We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred." He argued it would be "fair" for Russian property and assets to be confiscated to finance this. He said: "Russia will feel the weight of every missile, every bomb, every shell which it has fired at us." Follow below for updatesâ€¦
