WhatsApp down reports are on the rise today, with iPhone users saying they're getting a service temporarily unavailable error message when they try to use the Meta-owned app. Independent outage monitor Down Detector has registered a surge in WhatsApp down reports today which began around 2pm UK time. According to Down Detector stats, the majority of WhatsApp down reports are to do with server connection problems. As the issues hit WhatsApp users took to Twitter to discuss the issues they were facing. One tweeted: "Is whatsapp down or am i the only facing some issues @WhatsApp". While another posted: "Is it just me or WhatsApp is down?" One added: "Not me deleting Whatsapp to reinstall it and now it’s down." And another wrote: "@WhatsApp for some reason I’m trying to reinstall WhatsApp but nothing is happening. Anyone else having a problem. Pop up message says it’s temporarily down".  At the time of writing, the official WhatsApp Status Twitter nor the official WhatsApp Twitter account has commented on the service issues users have reported. But both Down Detector UK and downdetector.com has steadily been registering WhatsApp down reports today with no signs as yet of this slowing up. The reported WhatsApp issues come as users have found out about a new feature that could be heading to the market-leading messenger app.  It's emerged that WhatsApp could be working on a new feature that will let users exit a WhatsApp group quietly. Currently, when a WhatsApp users exits a group other members of that community will be notified about the departure. But according to the sleuths at WhatsApp centric news portal WABetaInfo, a new feature is in the works that will let users exit a group without everyone being notified. Instead, only you and the admin will receive a notification about this change.
