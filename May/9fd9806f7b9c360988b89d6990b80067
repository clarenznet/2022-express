Will Walden, Boris Johnson's former communications chief, warned the Prime Minister that he will "sleepwalk into the next disaster" if he does not change his ways now. In what Sky News' Tamara Cohen summed up as an exercise in "character assassination", Mr Walden explained that the behaviour of Mr Johnson's staff would not have happened under previous Prime Ministers. The Partygate report, published by Sue Gray has exposed significant Government failings, the report exposed Tory MPs bad behaviour, some of which consisted of drinking, vomiting and abusing cleaners and security guards during the lockdowns of 2020.  He accused the Prime Minister of "running a frat house" instead of a country due to all of the boozy parties held at No.10 during a global pandemic. Mr Walden told LBC: "This is about as he says, responsibility and I don't think it matters whether he spent a long time at these gatherings, he condoned them. "He went to them, and he didn't appear to care what happened next, and I think that's very worrying. "And most importantly he didn't ask staff to make sure that things stayed civilised. "And what I would say to you Nick and this is what worries me the most, is can we possibly imagine this kind of culture happening under Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown, Cameron or May? JUST IN: Kate’s favourite takeaway laid bare but William ‘wouldn't eat it with her’     "I think the answer is no, and I have to ask, where are the grownups, is he running a country or is he running a frat house? "It doesn't inspire confidence about serious governing and serious governing being done, and look you said to me should he resign and I'm divided on that. "What I would say is it's not a matter for me, but if he's going to survive into the future, he's got to stop saying that we need to move on, this is his mess it's no one else's mess that the truth of it. "And you lead first and foremost by understanding that and doing something about it, Two final points, yesterday the couldn't even tell us what lessons he had learned. "And what personal responsibility and what mistakes he has made, he was asked that directly at the press conference and he couldn't say, and frankly that's not good enough.

"And that may not matter to Tory MPs, but I fear that that matters to voters, and without change, Boris is sleepwalking into the next disaster, he has got to think about that for the sake of the country." Due to Mr johnson's behaviour, it hasn't been just Conservatives savaging him and calling for his resignation, but the opposition party, Labour are seeing Mr Johnson's scandal as a chance to take office. Labour MP Jess Phillips discussed Ms Gray's findings with Robert Peston.

Boris Johnson, I'm almost hopeful he goes into the next election because he's a busted flush."
