"What Pep's had with City when big players have come in, they get a bedding-in period. It's an understanding: this is hard, you don't hit the ground running all the time. "The biggest part of that is the humility of the players that struggle. They don't moan and kick up a fuss. That's where Haaland has to play his part if it doesn't go right. Suppress any ego... the bigger picture is not disturbing the morale of the squad."
