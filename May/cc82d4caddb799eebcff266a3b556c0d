Brooklyn Beckham, 23, and Nicola Peltz, 27, tied the knot last month in Florida on Nicola's family estate. The pair have been dating since 2020, and made sure to show their love for each other on the red carpet recently. They were attending Dior Men's Spring/Summer 2020 Collection runway show when they packed on the PDA. Nicola cut a stylish figure in a two-piece light blue suit and a small black clutch bag to accessorise. She appeared to have no top on underneath and the jacket only had one button, leaving her taut abs on full display. The actress opted went for a simple makeup look, featuring a nude lip and dark eyeliner. Nicola also slicked back her blonde tresses in a ponytail. Meanwhile, Brooklyn cut a casual figure in a hoodie and baggy silk trousers, along with Doc Martin style boots. The pair couldn't keep their hands off each other as they posed on the red carpet, with Brooklyn affectionately kissing his new wife's neck. They confirmed their relationship in January 2020, and it was confirmed seven months later that Brooklyn popped the question.
