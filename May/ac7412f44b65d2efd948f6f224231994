Katie Kenyon, 33, was last seen getting into a silver transit van in Burnley at 9.30am on April 22. Detectives launched a probe into her disappearance last week but then upgraded it to a murder investigation despite her body not being found. She was then discovered dead in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire, on Friday after further searches. A post-mortem examination found that Katie had died of head injuries. Her devastated family and friends have raised more than £15,000 to pay for her funeral and help provide for her son and daughter. The family said yesterday they wanted to raise money to fulfil "Katie's dreams she had planned with her children". The statement added that "our heartbreaking nightmare began when our Katie was taken away from her children and family far too soon".  Jenny Kenyon also paid tribute to her "beautiful big sister" and said she would love her for ever. She added: "Can't thank everybody enough for the support you have shown for beautiful Katie." Friends have also described Katie, of Padiham, near Burnley, as a "sweetheart". A close friend said: "I can't even tell you how devastating this has been to a family who are so tight-knit. An absolute diamond and loved by so many." Lancashire Police said: "Our thoughts remain with Katie's family and loved ones at this difficult time. The family continues to be supported by our trained officers."  Andrew Burfield, 50, of Burnley, has been charged with her murder and will stand trial in November. He did not enter a plea at Preston Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Burfield will next appear in court in August. More than 60 specialist officers were involved in the search in woodland along with the fire service, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Police said they found the body after "new information". Burnley Tory MP Antony Higginbotham, added: "This is incredibly sad news and I know the thoughts and condolences of many will be with Katie's friends and family."
