The government has called for an investigation into the grim scenes that overshadowed Liverpool’s Champions League final clash with Real Madrid in Paris. Reds supporters were tear-gassed by police and were forced to wait in lengthy queues, forcing kick-off to be delayed three times. Liverpool released a damning club statement in which it called for a full investigation to be launched into the cause of the chaos. UEFA, in turn, blamed fans who they accused of turning up late and possessing ‘fake’ tickets. Footage on social media showed fans being tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed outside the Stade de France. Lengthy queues meant that the kick-off was delayed three times, with the match finally starting at around 8:40PM UK time.  UEFA’s statement read: “In the lead-up to the game, the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles. “This created a build-up of fans trying to get in. As a result, the kick off was delayed by 35 minutes to allow as many fans as possible with genuine tickets to gain access. “As numbers outside the stadium continued to build up after kick off, the police dispersed them with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium. UEFA is sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the French police and authorities, and with the French Football Federation.” Liverpool were defeated 1-0 by Madrid in the final. Los Blancos forward Vinicius Jnr scored the game's only goal just before the hour, tapping home after Federico Valverde fired a cross-shot towards goal.
