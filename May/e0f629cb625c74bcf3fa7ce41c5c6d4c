  Nadia wore a makeshift bikini and long black gloves, astonishingly made out of dog muck bags, black cling film and gaffer tape. She also had a motorcycle helmet under one arm and accessorised with a pair of shades. The ITV host included a picture of Kim to her left hand side, who wore a similar outfit made out of what appeared to be a black, shiny vinyl material for Sports Illustrated. While Kim dipped her legs in a turquoise pool of water, Nadia’s pins hung off of the table next to her dog’s face.  Nadia's fans love to see the star make fun of Kim and her sisters through these Instagram posts, and on this occasion she decided to play a guessing game with her fans. “Can anyone guess what THREE ‘textiles ‘my brilliant stylist @thedinasawalha used to recreate @kimkardashian stunning @sportsillustrated look?” she asked her followers. “Clues are… “Woof woof, Stay fresh, This will keep anything in place!” (sic) “Guess away!!” she added, before finishing with a string of hashtags.
