After luring more middleclass shoppers by moving into affluent areas, the German firm has 8.8 percent of the market share of Britain's total supermarket sales. Analysts Kantar found rival Lidl is just behind at 6.6 percent. Ten years ago, the pair had a combined share of 5.5 percent. Big Four kingpin Tesco still holds 27 percent of the market, Sainsbury's has 15 percent and Asda 14.1 percent. The last of the current Big Four Morrisons may soon be knocked out by Aldi, now climbing closer to its share level of 9.5 percent. Giles Hurley, Aldi's UK chief executive, said: "Shoppers are prioritising value like never before - and voting with their feet to save money."
