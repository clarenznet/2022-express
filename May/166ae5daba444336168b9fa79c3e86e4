Johnny Depp's defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, 36, has entered its fourth week. The Pirates of the Caribbean star's security guard Travis McGivern was the first witness to testify during court proceedings on Monday, saying he was forced to intervene during the couple's arguments. He also described how Heard allegedly struck the 58-year-old "in the left side of his face" with "a closed fist" as he tried to remove the actor from their penthouse during a row. The security guard, testified via live video link, and described how fights between the pair escalated in March 2015, after the couple had returned from Australia. He told the court Depp and Heard had been arguing "every other night" and that the actor would at times call McGivern to the penthouse he shared with Heard as he usually wanted "to get out of there". McGivern said that while he typically tried not to listen in on the couple's bickering, he often heard "lots of name-calling" and "F-bombs" directed at the A-lister.

When asked what the actress would say during arguments, McGivern sighed and said: "Oh dear", drawing laughter from Depp. "Oh dear. It would vary, and to be honest, I tried not to pay attention. I was there to get Mr. Depp out of there," he said. "I've heard Ms. Heard call him a f*****g deadbeat dad - if I can say that. I apologise to the court," he said before continuing: "F*****g washed up... a f*****g c**t. You name it, she spewed it."  He went on to explain an incident where Heard allegedly stuck Depp on his face. He said: "We were in the office level, the middle level. She was agitated. Mr. Depp was agitated. I felt it was time to get Mr. Depp out of the situation. I stepped in between Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp, telling Mr. Depp we were leaving and it wasn't up to him anymore. "At that point out of the corner of my eye I saw a fist and an arm come across my right shoulder and I heard and saw a closed fist contact Mr. Depp in the left side of his face." Asked how the actor responded, McGivern said: "The initial look on his face mirrored mine, kind of shock, where did that come from? DON'T MISS...

He added: "I'd let him get hit by a Red Bull can, I'd let him get punched." The trial in the Fairfax County Courthouse runs Monday to Thursday and is set to conclude on May 19. McGivern's testimony comes after reports Heard has fired her PR team before she takes the stand. The Aquaman actress, 36, is said to have employed a new PR team as she prepares to take to the stand this week in the $100 million defamation trial. So far only Depp has taken the stand. An unnamed source claimed to the New York Post that the actress "doesn't like bad headlines". In addition, it has been reported a petition to remove Heard from the Aquaman sequel has neared three million signatures.
