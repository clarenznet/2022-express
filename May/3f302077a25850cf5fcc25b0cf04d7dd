On the first Monday in May, Hollywood’s elite gather for the annual Met Gala and this year was no exception. Michelle Yeoh, 59, looked elegant on the red carpet as she put on a stunning display. The Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actress opted for a pastel green gown with an impressive train. The star wore a diamond necklace to complete the look. Michelle wore her hair in a straight, slicked back style so all the attention was on her outfit. She also accessorised her look with a white watch. Fans were stunned by Michelle's elegant look, with many taking to social media to inundate her with praise for following the Met Gala's 2022 theme perfectly. Andrew Paul Wood tweeted: "Michelle Yeoh is, as always, flawless, immaculate. Some might call it safe, I prefer to think of it as classic. Structured and snatched. She would fit in at a Royal Wedding with the merciful absence of a silly hat. Love the palette of the dress and cape lining. The necklace!" Becky also gushed on Twitter: “I’m glad to wake up and see at least some people understood the assignment. Michelle Yeoh. Oof. A vision.” This year’s Met Gala theme is ‘Gilded Glamour and White Tie’.
