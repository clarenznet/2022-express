The attacker remains on the run after the horrific stabbing in the heart of the capital. The victim was rushed by ambulance to Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, where he died of his injuries.

No further information about the man, including his age, has been disclosed by police at this stage. Officers have made no arrests. In a statement, Assistant Commissioner Pete O'Doherty, from the constabulary, said: "City of London Police were called to reports of a stabbing in Gresham Street, EC2V, at 11.30pm on May 1. "Officers found a man suffering from serious injuries and carried out CPR at the scene before he was taken to the Royal London Hospital where he later sadly died. Enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made at this time."  Photos taken this morning show roads closed and officers patrolling the streets.

Last night's stabbing comes after a man in his 30s was killed in Greenwich, southeast London in the early hours of Sunday. Officers said a "shocking and brutal act of violence" led to the man’s death in the wealthy borough. It happened after a fight outside a bar near Greenwich railway station. Met Police continue to probe the death. Detective Chief Inspector Steve May said: "Officers are working tirelessly to locate the person responsible, and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed what happened or the events leading up to it to get in touch with us as soon as possible."
