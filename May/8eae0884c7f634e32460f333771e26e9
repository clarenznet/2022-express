Although the Premium Bond prize rate is 18 months out of date, these savings accounts still remain popular with Britons. However, one expert says there could be a "glimmer of hope" on the horizon for savers.    Premium Bonds have been popular with savers since they were first launched in the 1950s. While a huge part of their appeal is the chance to win £1million in the monthly prize draw, some experts say Britons would be better investing their savings elsewhere. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: “The Premium Bond prize rate is 18 months out of date: it hasn’t changed since the Christmas lockdown. “Loyal savers are standing by this national treasure, even as savings rates rise elsewhere, and by leaving the prize rate at one percent after so many base rate rises, it’s taking advantage of their loyalty.” READ MORE: 10 tried and tested ways to cut your inheritance tax bill          The personal finance expert added that the level of loyalty among savers means NS&I isn’t under any financial pressure to act. She said: “Premium Bonds are its biggest product, so a small change could bring in a lot more money. And right now, it doesn’t seem to need it. “In the current financial year, NS&I has a new financing target of £6billion – with a range of £3billion to £9billion. “Between the April and May draw, the number of bonds rose by over 655 million, which means £655million more for NS&I coffers.” DON'T MISS: Council tax rebate: Full list of councils who STILL haven't paid [UPDATE]Martin Lewis’ shares way millions of Britons can HALVE broadband bill [ALERT]Savings warning: The one action ‘guaranteed to lose you money’ [WARNING]   However, she added there is a glimmer of hope, because NS&I not only has a duty to raise money as efficiently as possible but also to balance that with the interests of savers. Ms Coles explained: “There will come a time when this means the prize rate rises. “We can only hope this time comes sooner rather than later.” Premium Bonds come at a higher cost than other savings accounts as people aren’t guaranteed to win or make one percent in interest. Ms Coles said: “In an average year, someone with £1,000 in the bonds will win nothing. "It’s worth knowing the chances of a win too. “While the chance of any win at all with a £1 bond is 34,500, the chances of winning £1million is one in 58.58 billion - which is vanishingly small. Of course, on the flip side, all prizes are tax free, so the higher the rate of tax you pay, the greater the advantage. “Savers also like the fact that money in Premium Bonds is backed 100 percent by the Treasury.” What is happening where you live?
