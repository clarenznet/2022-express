Princess Beatrice joined the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Earl and Countess of Wessex at the garden party. Despite the rain, the royal looked very elegant in a brown and white midi dress from Self Portrait. Beatrice combined the gown with a very stylish headband. She accessorised the look with a pair of black stilettos and a matching clutch bag. Princess Beatrice kept her long hair loose around her shoulders and opted for a natural make-up look.
