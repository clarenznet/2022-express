Students and trade unionists had united to demand the resignation of President Charles de Gaulle. Rioters took to the barricades and fought running battles with armed police in a bid to oust the former war leader, who was seen as a political reactionary. 28 years ago (1994) Camelot won the contract to run Britain's first National Lottery after defeating seven other contenders, including Richard Branson. The consortium pledged that 30 per cent of its takings would be divided equally between charities, the arts, sport, national heritage projects and a "millennium fund". 61 years ago (1961) American president John F Kennedy asked US Congress to fund a huge space programme that would put man on the Moon by the end of the decade. His request came after the Russians accelerated their lead in the space race by putting cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth.
