Kemarni Watson Darby was found lifeless with more than 20 rib fractures and internal injuries after abuse by Nathaniel Pope and Alicia Watson. He died from internal bleeding, and a court heard the force used was similar to a collision or a fall from height. Pope used wire to keep Kemarni, right, in his bedroom before he "lost it" and battered the youngster, leaving him to bleed to death in a flat in West Bromwich, West Midlands. Watson, 31, was last month convicted of causing or allowing her son's death and Pope, 32, was found guilty of murder. Both were convicted of multiple counts of child cruelty, at Birmingham Crown Court. Pope, of Wolverhampton, was yesterday jailed for life with a minimum 24 years. Watson, from Handsworth, was given 11 years. Mrs Justice Amanda Tipples told Pope he considered the boy "a nuisance" who got in the way of his relationship with Watson: "Knowing he was in extreme distress and pain you left him to bleed to death on the sofa. "The fatal injuries were extremely severe and a result of extreme force...compatible with the type of injuries seen in a road traffic collision or when an individual falls." She told Kemarni's mother: "This would have been clear to you, Alicia Watson, yet you neglected to do anything about it. "The final assault involved multiple blows to chest, limbs and abdomen. I do not detect any remorse." Giovanni D'Alessandro, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Watson and Pope had lied and blamed each other.
