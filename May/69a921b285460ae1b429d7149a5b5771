"Koulibaly is the best centre-back in the world - and he has more room for improvement," the Italian said in 2019. "He is worth â‚¬150m and he is non-transferable. Napoli do not need to sell, the president does not want to sell and the question does not arise." Three years on and Napoli now do appear to need to sell, though Ancelotti might rue the fact that he will not reunite with Koulibaly. Instead, he might have inadvertently forced his old team Chelsea to go all-out for the centre-back as Rudiger makes his way to Madrid.
