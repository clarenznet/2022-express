Britain's richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe is supposedly holding out hope that he can reignite his Chelsea takeover bid despite being turned away by the bank in charge of the sale. A consortium headed up by Todd Boehly has already been selected as the preferred bidder, but Ratcliffe and his INEOS team submitted a shock late offer worth over Â£4billion in total. The Blues have been forced into an ownership transition after Roman Abramovich, who bought the club back in 2003, was hit by UK government sanctions due to alleged ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Culture secretary Nadine Dorries has heaped pressure on Chelsea to get a move on, claiming that they are already on 'borrowed time'. Their takeover took another step when Boehly's consortium was selected as the preferred bidder, but Ratcliffe's approach threatened to throw a spanner in the works. Now, The Telegraph claim that he is waiting to pounce should Boehly fail to finalise his takeover this week. **We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures, and video on this breaking news story.
