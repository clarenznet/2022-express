Ex-Belgian Prime Minister and Chair of the EU's Brexit Steering Group Guy Verhofstadt announced the plans via a video clip on Twitter. The Europhile MEP could be seen with other members of the European Parliament applauding the proposed changes. Mr Verhofstadt said an EU army had become more likely following the Conference on the Future of Europe.  In 2014, the idea of an EU army was labelled as a "dangerous fantasy that is simply not true" by then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. Remainer-in-Chief and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell even described the prospect as a "myth" just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum.
