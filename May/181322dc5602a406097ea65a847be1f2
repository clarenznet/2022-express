The Queen’s eldest granddaughter took up golf this year, and her performance so far has been notable, according to her husband. The Rugby World Cup-winning player and former England captain made an adorable post on Instagram to compliment and encourage his wife for a “big year ahead”. He wrote: "I love seeing my sporting idol doing her thing outside of the golfing arena!!” And added: "It's a big year ahead. #chatsworth #eventing." The loving tribute included a video showed of Zara taking part in the Chatsworth Horse Trials, a three-day world-class equestrian event. Fans were left in awe from the acclimation, so much that they rushed to comment expressing their admiration for the couple. An Instagram user by the name daisy_blackcat commented: “She’s awesome.” Xmisswrightx wrote: “The queen must be so proud of her granddaughter” “Well done Zara”, said henry_shill. While someone else with the username bethrsmith1 said: “Love that you refer to her as your ‘sporting idol’!!” Others also expressed the enthusiasm commenting: “Amazing horse woman”, “Congrats!!”, and “She’s incredible”. Zara, 41, the daughter of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Philips is an established equestrian and Olympian. She is also a patron of the Mark Davies Injured Riders Fund and posed for a portrait by artist Jack Vettriano to support Sport Relief 2008. Last week, her husband hosted the ninth ISPS Handa Celebrity Golf Classic at The Belfry, in Sutton Coldfield, and Zara was dazzled with happiness by his side. The event raised money for charity partners The Cure Parkinson's Trust and The Matt Hampson Foundation. Mr Tindall told of his joy golfing with Zara after she took up the sport this year. He said to Hello Magazine: "Zara has this year taken up golf with the Slingsby golf academy, so she is going to be hitting a few balls, but she also does a great job raising money through selling Mulligans around the course.”
