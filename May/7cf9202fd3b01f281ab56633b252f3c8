Conservative MP Lucy Frazer, Labour's Lucy Powell, SNP Alyn Smith, commentator Mo Hussein and Emily Carver from the Institute of Economic Affairs make up Thursday's panel in Liverpool. But activist and outspoken Remainer Femi Oluwole said the show should be "ashamed" for including Emily Carver, accusing her of "personal attacks". Taking to Twitter he said: "The level of barrel scraping by having Carver on your show? "A host of Talk Radio's "Plank of the Week" where she spends 10 minutes just personally attacking black people and those they marry. Your planning team should be ashamed." He added: "All you've done is show that any ‘think tank’ with money can get whoever they like on your show, regardless of substance."So congrats on demonstrating the worst part of the UK media system."
