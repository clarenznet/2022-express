Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is set to hold talks with returning loan star Conor Gallagher over his future at the club, but is reportedly still unsure over whether to keep him at Stamford Bridge next season. Gallagher has shone at Crystal Palace this season during his loan spell in east London. The midfielder made an instant impact under Patrick Vieira and even won himself a call-up to the England squad earlier in the campaign. Due to his impeccable debut campaign in the Premier League, it was expected that he would return to Chelsea this summer and be in the reckoning for a place in the squad for next season. But instead, it seems Tuchel isn't completely decided on what to do with Gallagher, and will hold a private meeting with the youngster. According to Fabrizio Romano, Tuchel is "not 100 per-cent" on whether to include him in his plans for next season. Palace have reportedly made it clear to Chelsea that they want to keep Gallagher at Selhurst Park for next season. Patrick Vieira said of Gallagher: "Conor has been fantastic for us. He felt like he is at home the way he has been performing for us. He understands the way that we want to play the game, and he brings his energy and his determination. “We know that he has to go back to Chelsea. Then, what will happen? We don't know. But what is important is that he came for a year, and he worked hard and worked well, and he gave something to the team and the football club. It was a win-win. He was really happy with us. He played really well, which allowed him to go to England. He's happy, so we are happy.” Chelsea's midfield could look drastically different next season, with Manchester United reportedly mulling over a bid for N'Golo Kante. The Blues are said to be unwilling to sell the 31-year-old, but United are desperate to sign a new central midfielder. Erik ten Hag is expected to immediately look to sign reinforcements in the middle of the park, with Frankie de Jong also believed to be a target.
