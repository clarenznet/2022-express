Tipping Point host Ben Shephard was joined on the ITV quiz show by candidates Wilma, Dylan and Glen. All three had high hopes of winning over the machine to claim the jackpot, but it was Dylan who managed to make it as the last contestant standing. However, his choice of drop zone for the jackpot counter sparked some online outrage, with many fans questioning if he had ever seen the show. Dylan got off the starting block to a flying start after Glen passed his correct question counter to him, hoping he would only make a dent in the machine. However, his lucky coin managed to not only knock eight counters down and score him £400, but he also won a mystery prize of a boozy afternoon tea hamper. As the show progressed, Wilma left the first after Glen leapfrogged her, and Dylan thought he was next, but luckily for him, Glen fell one counter and £50 short of making it to the final. Advancing with his £1,350, it was time for Dylan to put the jackpot counter into the machine, and he decided to go for drop zone three.  Immediately several fans voiced how bizarre his choice of drop zone was. Confused, @Batman3983 said: "Who the f**k has ever won by going in dz3? "It really makes me unnecessarily angry!!! #tippingpoint." (sic) Replying to her fellow annoyed viewer, @ElayeMagsAbidde commented: "Especially when there's a double that is easier to get in drop zone one.    "Honestly, has he ever seen this game before?" Rallying it back to her, he added: "Tell me about it. The number of times it gets pushed across into another zone too, making it almost impossible to win. "GO IN ONE OR FOUR WHERE THERE IS A F***ING WALL TO HELP!!!" (sic) "DzThree? He off his t**s? #TippingPoint," (sic) @STE4T proclaimed.

His poor choice of drop zone resulted in the end of his lucky streak, @Mysteron_Voice also pointed out: "Why do you go on #TippingPoint, get to the final and then play for two counter questions ..." Dylan's drop zone choice cut even deeper as just before placing the jackpot coin, he stated that he was "following his daughter's advice." He said: "She [His daughter Bella] was one of the people who inspired me to go on."  Dylan added: "[She said] 'Go for the one where at the top you have got a chance of getting it [a counter] down.' "I think based on that I will go for drop zone three." Despite failing to budge the jackpot counter to the finishing line, he chose to take the cash and left with £2,150. Tipping Point airs weekdays at 4pm on ITV.
