Jay Blades, 51, looked smart as he took his fiance Lisa-Marie Zbozen to the BAFTA TV Awards. The Repair Shop star wore a black suit and bow tie, along with his signature cap and glasses. His partner Lisa brought a touch of elegance as she posed in a frilled, cream number. She wore her hair pulled back in a slick ponytail, and opted for a minimal makeup look. Jay took to Instagram last December to announce he had proposed to Lisa with a ring specially designed by his co-star and goldsmith, Richard Talman. Sharing a snap of Lisa-Marie's stunning ring, Jay told fans: "Good afternoon all. Lunchtime Treat. It gives me great pleasure to announce that I got engaged to @lisamariezbozen."
