Amanda Holden, 51, showed age was just a number this morning as she stunned in a pink two-piece. The Britain's Got Talent presenter stunned in the bright pink satin top, which featured puffed sleeves. Along with the bright cropped top, Amanda wore a matching satin maxi skirt, exposing the presenter's taut abs. The skirt also featured a thigh-high slit, leaving Amanda's toned pins on full display. Not to take away from the pink theme Amanda wore bright pink stiletto heels and a baby pink lip gloss. She also coordinated her nails with a nude colour, making sure the outfit was what grabbed everyone's attention. Amanda kept her signature blonde tresses straight and went for a smokey-eyed look. Along with posting a picture of her outfit on Instagram, she also posted her daily catwalk video to her story in view of her 1.8 million followers. She captioned the picture: "#morning." Many social media users rushed to the comments to compliment the star on her winning Monday morning look. Melissaodabash said: "Who looks that fire at that time in the morning?" Her colleague Ashley Roberts added: "Pretty in Pink!" Fandel_Scott commented: "Pretty in Pink has arrived!"
