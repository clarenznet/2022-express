Eva Longoria, 47, showed off her trim figure and taut abs as she continued to attend the Cannes Film Festival today. The Desperate Housewives actress went braless as she showed off her ample assets. She looked amazing in the green cut-out dress, from Stella McCartney. Eva completed the look with green stiletto heels and large dark sunglasses. She accessorised the dress with gold jewellery and wore her hair slicked back in a long ponytail. It comes as it was revealed that Eva only spent $40 on the dress she wore to her first ever Cannes Film festival in 2005. The Hollywood actress wore a knitted tight-fitted gold dress as she walked the red carpet those years ago. In an interview with People this week, Eva said: "I was like, I'll just wear this one, this knit gold, that feels right. Nobody would've known it was a $40 dress." Eva also revealed that she "had no idea what Cannes was" when she bought the dress from a store on Melrose Avenue. She continued: "It's not the dress, it's the woman who wears the dress."
