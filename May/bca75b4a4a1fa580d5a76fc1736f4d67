Almost two thirds of councils increased the number of roads that had parking restrictions in place, mostly on town centre, residential and suburban roads. Drivers were issued with £254.9million in fines last year, which is equivalent to £700,000 a day, which is up 8.6 percent from the previous year where £234.6million worth of fines were handed out. This meant that motorists were hit with 10 parking fines every minute in 2021. It now means that 80,200 - or one tenth of total roads - have some form of restriction on them, an increase of 1,200 since 2020. Nearly a third of councils also implemented new resident parking permit controls in 2021. The data was obtained by Churchill Motor Insurance through freedom of information requests to councils, with 71 percent of councils responding to the requests.

The new research is likely to infuriate families hit by the rising cost of living as they see councils boosting revenue through parking charges. Nicholas Mantel, Head of Churchill Motor Insurance, commented on the data, saying it is having a damaging impact on drivers. He said: “Parking is one of the most stressful aspects of driving, especially for families, who are often stretched for time and who don’t want their car too far from their ultimate destination.

This was a rise of 400,000 compared to 2020, when 4.8 million were issued and equates to 1,300 more parking fines per day throughout the year. Two thirds of councils saw a rise in the number of fines handed out in 2021 and a subsequent increase in revenue. Around two million PCNs were issued in London last year, meaning the capital accounted for over a third of all PCNs in 2021. This was followed by the south east with 18 percent, the north west with 15 percent and the East Midlands with seven percent of total fines. On a local authority level, Manchester handed out the greatest number of PCNs for parking in 2021. The city issued more than 341,000 parking tickets, a rise of 74,000 (27 percent) compared to 2020. It was followed by Westminster (274,000) and Kensington and Chelsea (153,000). The other non-London local authorities in the top 10 were Nottingham which issued 145,000, Brighton and Hove (136,000) and Winchester (130,000).
