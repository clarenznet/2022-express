The Duke and Duchess of Sussex live in Montecito, California with children Archie, two, and Lilbet, who was born in June. It is located in an area reportedly at a greater risk of wildfires. A source told the Sunday People : “There have been reports about hikers going out on late-night jaunts close to Harry and Meghan’s place. “It’s a possible threat to them and the children, not least because there have also been claims hikers have been smoking and tossing their cigarettes on the ground. “Any fire there could easily get out of control.” Of the problem, neighbour Bruce Savin told the Montecito Journal: “Last Saturday night, we saw dozens of hikers with flashlights at 9.30pm. "In disbelief we watched a hiker take a puff off his cigarette before extinguishing it under his foot. “Night hiking is dangerous enough but in a high-risk fire area it is an ­absolute threat to us all.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
