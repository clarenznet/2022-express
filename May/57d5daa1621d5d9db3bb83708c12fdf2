Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will join the Royal Family during the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations at the start of next month. Their attendance comes amid speculation of tension between the prince and his brother, Prince William, and father, Prince Charles. Last month, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex returned to the UK for the first time together since their shock exit. During their stop in Windsor, the couple met with Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and later, the Queen.Harry did not get the opportunity to see his brother during his fleeting visit as William and his wife, Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, were on a family ski trip in France.The brothers are understood to have not seen each other since July last year, when they unveiled a statue of their late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.The Duke of Sussex reignited reports of a rift between the princes when he dodged a question asking whether he missed his father and brother during an interview last month. Instead of answering the question, Harry told NBC’s Hoda Kotb that he was focusing on the competitors at the Invictus Games.It came after reports that Harry’s meeting with Charles had been “edgy”.Now, Camilla Tominey, associate editor at The Daily Telegraph, has claimed Charles and William will be putting on “brave faces” when reunited with the Sussexes next month.Speaking during the Royal Insight — a video series hosted by Ms Tominey — on Thursday, she said: “Prince Charles — the only emotions that have been used by him or his people about how he has reacted to things like the Oprah interview was sadness rather than anger. “So dad is sad. I think brother is angry and sad. But as was the case with Prince Philip’s funeral, brave faces will be put on proceedings.“The most interesting addition to the proceedings of course is Meghan because previously we’ve seen Harry by himself in the UK and now the duchess is going to come back into the fold.“Obviously, the body language and the reading of it is going to be quite fascinating.”Initially, it was reported that Meghan and Harry would appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during Trooping the Colour — the Queen’s annual birthday parade.

Katie Nicholl, author of ‘William and Harry: Behind the Palace Walls’, told Entertainment Tonight last month: “Harry, I’m told, suggested perhaps that they might get some sort of a mediator in on sort of these talks, to make some progress.“It was something that he had suggested to his father.“He’s made it very clear that he wants to sort things out.“He wants things to be improved.” Meanwhile, PA royal correspondent Alan Jones told True Royalty's ‘The Royal Beat’: "I think William has still got a lot of time for Harry. He's his little brother at the end of the day."Even though they haven't seen eye to eye, I think there is still that brotherly bond, their mother's death has created this unbreakable tie between them."At the end of the day, he will always put his arm around him, whatever he said about the family.”
