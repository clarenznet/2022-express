Last week, bosses at Oakham Medical Practice in Rutland, East Midlands - which serves more than 15,000 people - made the decision to switch the building's reception service to a self check-in screen, reports Leicestershire Live. In a statement posted online, the medical centre said: "Due to excessive verbal abuse and physical intimidation of our Patient Services Team, the Partners have made the decision to close our front desk. "Patients with booked appointments can check in using the screen in the foyer. For all other queries, please visit our website." The Local Medical Committee for Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLRLMC) has labelled the decision "a very sad, but inevitable consequence" of a rise in abuse experienced by general practices during and since the pandemic, which it calls "the greatest health crisis in a generation". Members of the committee, which is an elected body representing local GPs, have expressed their support for the decision. Dr Nainesh Chotai, chair of the LLRLMC, said: "GPs understand the frustration of patients who struggle to make appointments with them, but verbal or physical abuse is not an acceptable response. "The current situation is due to increased workload whilst the number of GPs has decreased." According to statistics from the British Medical Association, a trade union representing doctors, half of GPs reported facing verbal abuse, one in five have been threatened themselves and 67% have witnessed violence or abuse against other staff during the month of July last year. Dr Chotai adds: "Although GPs are providing the highest number of appointments ever recorded, the increased workload due to the pandemic means that we cannot provide the service that our patients want and we would like to provide."
