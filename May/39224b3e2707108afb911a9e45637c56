Ukrainian "Stugna" Volunteer Battalion can be seen successfully destroying a Russian BTR.The Ukrainian military troop can be seen on video successfully laying mines, with the aim of hitting heavy Russian artillery tanks. The war in Ukraine has been raging for well over three months, and peace talks between both neighbouring countries have been halted, with no clear sign of the end of the war in sight. Mines have been used throughout the war in Ukraine at certain points, despite much historical knowledge and condemnation of the devices. Video footage shows a Ukrainian serviceman digging a hole in the ground. The Army volunteer then buries a circular medium sized landmine directly in the ground. The footage then jumps forward to show the aftermath of a Russian BTR, which has been successfully hit by the land mine after driving over the deadly device. Pillars of smoke can then be seen rising up into the sky, as the military tank sits in a country field engulfed in orange flames. JUST IN: Have Your Say: Should Charles apologise to Canada? 'Itâ€™s not enough'  Many human rights campaign groups have slammed the use of land mines, as they take years if not decades to successfully clear. @Operation_Ryan said: "I thought the procedure with this sort of thing is to use it as part of an ambush, killing the soldiers that make it out of the burning wreck." @Morken666 added: "sheds some nice extra info, now we can see these mines are really planted on purpose for a specific target, and not just "sprayed" around. That's maybe why we often see drone footage of vehicles running into mines" @CillianMacgill said: "Good, stuff but I hope they are mapping these properly. I lived in Bosnia in the 90s and after war, for years there were areas still closed off due to mines or suspicions of mine due to militias planting them and not mapping when they did."
