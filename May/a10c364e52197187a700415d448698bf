David Beckham's wife Victoria Beckham has shared a series of never-before-seen pictures from Brooklyn Beckham's wedding to Nicola Peltz. The 48-year-old shared photos from what appeared to have been taken after the couple's nuptials. The pictures showed Victoria and her husband David partying with friends Eva Longoria, Serena Williams and Marc Anthony. The first snap was a group photo of the Spice Girl who looked chic in a black dress with crochet-detailing. Eva wore a long-sleeve coral silk gown. Serena rocked a leather minidress while Marc, David, and Victoria's longtime friend Ken Paves wore black pants and white shirts casually unbuttoned. A second photo showed the mum-of-four in a selfie with her youngest daughter Harper and her pal Eva. In view of her 30 million Instagram followers, Victoria penned: "Friday night throwback celebrating with friends post wedding! We love you!!! @davidbeckham @evalongoria @kenpaves @serenawilliams @amberridinger @lorenridinger @marcanthony @nadiatferreira #HarperSeven." Fans flocked to comment on the post, as Derek excitedly wrote: "Wait a second!!!! Where do we get to see the rest?" Mik gushed: "Beautiful," while July added: "J'adore!" followed by heart emojis.
