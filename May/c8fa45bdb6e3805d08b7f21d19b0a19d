There are concerns that the woman may have been injured after her seating area collapsed. According to an eyewitness at the scene, she was extracted after a few minutes. She was then put in an ambulance on a stretcher. A second seating area also reportedly collapsed, but nobody fell through. However, the eyewitness said "she seemed fine" but was "badly shaken". She said there was "complete confusion" and "chaos". Speaking to the Mirror, the eyewitness said: "We were told to stand and heard a scream and then there was chaos in the section.   "Turned out part of it had collapsed and a woman had fallen through. "The paramedics rushed in but started yelling ‘we can’t find her'. "She was extracted after several minutes and seemed fine but badly shaken and was put on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance. "The crowd was calm but was later moved out of that section."   She added: "Then a second section had a similar collapse and the crowd was moved but with no one falling through. "The striking thing was that there seemed to be complete confusion with police about what to do and where to find the victim under the bleachers. "But the medics did the best they could with no guidance." Another eyewitness said: "What we just witnessed was terrifying, but we are safe! "Part of the floor in the stand collapsed, and at least one person fell through.  "We are praying for the injured and shocked. "The stands are being evacuated." The chaos unfolded at the second of three rehearsals for the event earlier today. The first, the Brigade Major's Review, took place on Thursday.  The final rehearsal will take place on Saturday, May 28, the week before the real event. Trooping the Colour, a ceremony performed by regiments of the British Army, will take place on the first day of the Queen's Jubilee weekend. This year, Buckingham Palace confirmed that only working royals will appear on the balcony, meaning Harry and Meghan will not take part in the iconic moment.
