Novak Djokovic’s coach has revealed that the pair have an “agreement” in place for difficult moments on the match court. Goran Ivanisevic admitted he and his charge often have disagreements but “didn’t mind” the Serb yelling or screaming during matches ahead of Djokovic’s fourth round match at the French Open. Djokovic is successfully into the second week of the French Open without dropping a set, as the reigning champion this year. But his path is about to get more challenging as he faces Diego Schwartzman in the round-of-16 with a potential Rafael Nadal clash looming in the quarter-finals. With the world No 1 often in high-pressure situations on the match court, his coach has now admitted they have an “agreement” for frustrating moments mid-match, though Ivanisevic refused to reveal exactly what that was. “We cannot talk during the match, so we have an agreement that he always comes back to one or two things. He stabilises himself pretty quickly,” the retired former world No 1 told Tennis Majors. The 2001 Wimbledon champion also said he “didn’t mind” his charge screaming or yelling on the court as long as Djokovic won, as he understood the stress of competition. “On the court, he is alone, I am aware that sometimes he seeks some reaction, I understand him when he yells as well,” he said.

Emotions are sometimes overwhelming and you just need to let it all out. Look, let him scream, let him take it all out, as long as he wins, that is the most important thing.” And Djokovic’s coach also shared the disagreements they had on the practice court, revealing that the serve was a shot the pair often debated. He explained: “Many times we disagree on some things, which is normal in a coach-player relationship, but we share the same goal – that he improves every day and that he is happy on the court.

Believe me, the serve is the hardest shot in tennis – if you think about too many things about your serve, it just can’t work. You need to focus on one thing, two at best, and then every aspect of the serve – and there are five or six of them – will come together.” But Ivanisevic - who has coached the likes of Marin Cilic and Milos Raonic - said Djokovic had also taught him about being a good coach through their work together. “I have learned a lot from Novak and I have improved tremendously as a coach. Before everything, I am more patient. A coach needs to be patient and to stay positive,” he said.
