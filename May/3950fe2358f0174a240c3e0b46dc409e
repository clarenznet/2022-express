Max Verstappen produced a stunning performance to win a chaotic Spanish Grand Prix ahead of Sergio Perez to complete a Red Bull one-two in Barcelona and move into the lead of the Drivers' Championship standings in the process. The Dutchman was given a lifeline when pole-sitter Charles Leclerc was forced to retire with a power unit failure and managed to hold off George Russell before Perez was ordered to let him through during his final stint of the afternoon on fresher medium tyres. Leclerc kept Verstappen at bay off the line and raced into a huge lead after the Red Bull man and Carlos Sainz spun into the gravel inside the opening 10 laps. However, the Monegasque driver was cruelly forced to take an early bath when his engine gave up on him shortly before the halfway mark in a devastating blow to his hopes of claiming the end-of-season honours. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton's slim chances of a podium finish were dashed when he tangled with Kevin Magnussen on the opening lap of the race. The seven-time champion managed to recover incredibly well, though, to clinch an impressive fifth-placed finish despite having to contend with minor damage for the vast majority of the 66-lap contest.
