The unique park bench, dedicated to a man called Huw Davies, is located on the grounds of Aberystwyth castle in Wales. The plaque reads: "In loving memory of Huw Davies / Used to sit here and shout 'F*** o**!' at the seagulls".  It was spotted yesterday by James Vaughan, who was out for a walk with his family, reports Wales Online. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: "By some distance the best park bench memorial I’ve ever encountered." The post has since received more than 177,000 likes. Some users were quick to find the funny side of the park bench. Stigma Later wrote: "This is the kind of legacy I hope to leave behind too". Liam Ó Maolcathaigh tweeted: "Apparently there are in existence some hilarious park benches", while Becky Coburn said: "Huw seems like a person I'd of liked to have met". Sir Stevie Ricketts, of the Rowdy Table, added: "Respect to him and his friends and relatives. That is immense! And, I bet every day someone looks at it and smiles, if not, laughs? May we all achieve that level of legendary". Although the message has garnered widespread attention online, little is known about its backstory. Some on social media suggested that the park bench had something to do with comedian Ricky Gervais' hit TV Netflix show, After Life, which covers issues such as grief and loss while managing to offer moments of great humour at times. Other Twitter users shared their favourite park bench memorials, such as a bench that had a plaque: "In memory of Roger Bucklesby/ Who hated this park and everyone in it", as well as one dedicated to a Hayden Kays that said: "Forever missed by his friends and family - He's not dead yet. He's just become increasingly anti-social".
