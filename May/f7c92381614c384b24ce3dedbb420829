The Danish Queen sat down with ITV's Lucy Watson as both monarchs prepare to celebrate enormous milestones in their regal lifetimes. Margrethe, who ascended to the throne in 1972, will celebrate her Golden Jubilee celebrations. Margrethe, 82, and Elizabeth, 96, are also third cousins as the pair both descend from Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark. Speaking about one of Elizabeth's royal visits to the Scandinavian states, Margrethe said: "It was a great occasion and they came on the Britannia and we received them at the quay down at the harbour. "And then we drove in open carriages through Copenhagen and it was a lovely occasion." "The way she has faced her duties, the way she is dedicated but also that she does it with a smile."

"You can feel the humour through it. "There's no doubt that she has a marvellous sense of humour. "She can look very serious but one knows that underneath it. "And she's aware of everything that happens around her." She added: "I do know that when something funny happens in the background she will see it."
