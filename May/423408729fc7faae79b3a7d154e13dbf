Camilla Christina Pamdahl, 46, was killed at a pedestrian crossing. According to local police, the man allegedly hit Ms Pamdahl while attempting to overtake a stopped car whilst drunk. He reportedly fled the scene on foot after the crash but was subsequently arrested by Cyprus police a few hours later.  The incident occurred on Wednesday Night on Nissi Avenue in the Mediterranean resort town. A spokesperson for Cyprus police said: "A young man driving the rental buggy overtook a stopped car, and hit the woman." Ms Pamdahl was taken to Famagusta general hospital but she was declared dead on arrival. According to Cyprus Mail, the police spokesperson said the man had four times the legal limit of alcohol in his system. He also tested positive for cannabis.   The driver is expected to appear in court later today to be remanded in custody. According to the Cyprus Times, the mother had left her five-year-old daughter at their hotel under the supervision of a hotel employee. She was on her way to buy groceries from the local shop but never returned. The child's father, who was not in Cyrpus at the time, has been contacted by the police. The girl is currently in the care of Welfare Office officials and a child psychologist. Ayia Napa is a very popular destination for British tourists.
