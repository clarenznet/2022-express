Red Bull star Max Verstappen lifted the lid on the mishap that may have handed Charles Leclerc pole at the Spanish Grand Prix. Sitting pretty on provisional pole, the Dutchman lost power in the closing stages of Q3 and his Ferrari rival stormed through to take the top spot ahead of Sunday's race. On whether his engine mishap cost him pole, Verstappen said: "It's always difficult to tell, but I couldn't do my final run. I just lost power. It's a bit of a shame, but overall, to be on the front row given how the weekend has gone was a good achievement. But of course I would've liked to go on that final run. On whether Red Bull could continue to wield their tyre advantage over Ferrari, he added: "The last few races we have been pretty decent on the tryes. Tomorrow will be hot, this track will be tough to pass on but we'll see." **We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures, and video on this breaking news story.
