Average house prices across the UK increased by 10.9 percent over the year to February 2022, up from 10.2 percent in January 2022, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics. Between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2019, there was a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England. The start of 2020 saw a pick-up in annual growth in the housing market before the coronavirus restrictions were put in place at the end of March 2020. The most and least expensive properties sold in England and Wales between January and March this year have been revealed. Land Registry data shows a flat sold for £16,500 exactly - the cheapest price on the list - in the location of Sunderland. On the other end of the spectrum, the most expensive properties listed are, perhaps unsurprisingly, sold in London, specifically in the region of Kensington and Chelsea. The priciest abode was a house in Greater London that exchanged hands for an eye-watering £22,000,000. Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including some possible changes in housing preferences and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations. In July 2020, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a suspension of the tax paid on property purchases in England and Northern Ireland, with similar suspensions announced in Scotland and Wales.

This may allow sellers to request higher prices as buyers’ overall costs are reduced. The tax holiday for Scotland ended on March 31, 2021. It was extended until June 30, 2021 in Wales, while in England and Northern Ireland, it was extended until the same date but the threshold will then decrease to £250,000 before ending on September 30, 2021. This may have accounted for a rush of demand in mid-2021, as annual price rises soared to a 13.5 percent increase in the year to June 2021. There was another smaller rush in September, with annual growth at 11.5 percent that month. According to the Land Registry, 22,298 home sales have been registered for January, 29,353 for February, and 9,519 for March. It may take several weeks for sales to be registered after completion so some sales from later in the period may not be listed yet.

The Land Registry has also warned its services are likely to be disrupted due to the pandemic, particularly the process of registering a new sale, which likely means a longer delay between the house sale completing and the record being updated at the Land Registry. Based on the data covering the period so far, across England and Wales, there were 1,883 £1million or more sales, including 374 at £2million or more. The Land Registry lists the price paid for every property bought at market value. The data also includes sales under a power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where they can be identified by a Mortgage) and transfers to non-private individuals.
