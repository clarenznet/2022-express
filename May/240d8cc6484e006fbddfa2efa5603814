Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and their children are to attend the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations but have been omitted from the Trooping the Colour balcony appearance by the Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed on Friday, also their son Archie's third birthday, that they were "excited and honoured" to attend the commemorations for the monarch's milestone in June with their eldest child and his sister Lilibet. But the Queen has limited the Trooping the Colour balcony appearance to working members of her family, with the Duke of York and Harry and Meghan missing out. Speaking to Daily Pop on E! News, presenter Loni Love said: "First of all, Meghan and Harry asked to come to the Jubilee. "They didn't ask to be on the balcony so, I think that's the thing. "I think this is more about Prince Andrew and making sure he's not on it that Harry and Meghan. "They just added Harry and Meghan so it wouldn't look they snubbed Andrew.

"The thing that Harry and Meghan reportedly want to do is make sure that their grandchildren meet the Queen. It is not known which elements of the four-day Jubilee weekend Harry and Meghan could make an appearance at. A spokeswoman for the couple said: "Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are excited and honoured to attend The Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children."  It will be the first time Harry and Meghan have brought their family to the UK since leaving for the US. Lili's first birthday falls during the Jubilee weekend on June 4 and she is yet to meet the Queen, the Prince of Wales and other members of the family. The monarch's decision to only include royals carrying out official public duties was taken "after careful consideration", Buckingham Palace said. The symbolic move by the Queen has been interpreted as a snub to Harry and Meghan, who quit the monarchy for a new life in the US two years ago, and to Andrew, who was cast out of the institution over his civil sexual assault case.
