The Northern Ireland Secretary said Ms Gray would not have published her investigation if she was uncomfortable with it. According to claims in a Sunday paper, the senior civil servant was lobbied to remove names from the final 37-page document and had edits made before its release on Wednesday. The newspaper said "tweaks" were made on the eve of publication by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay, who is also chief of staff in No 10. Asked for an assurance that nobody in Downing Street or the civil service tried to influence the report, Mr Lewis said: "I'm absolutely confident that's the case. Knowing Sue Gray, I don't believe anybody would be able to pressure her into putting any kind of report out that she wasn't confident with." Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: "Brandon's half-hearted denial isn't good enough. The only way to get to the truth is to make public any correspondence between Downing Street and Sue Gray."
