We also celebrated the opening of the Festival Of Britain in London by a "happy" King George VI. The brainchild of Clement Attlee's Deputy PM Herbert Morrison, it marked the centenary of the 1851 Great Exhibition and was intended to give the entire country a huge lift amid the hardship of post-war rationing. 96 years ago (1926) More than a million British workers walked out after the TUC called a general strike in support of the miners, who had suffered wage reductions and worsening conditions. The dispute lasted for nine days but ultimately failed because Stanley Baldwin's Tory government used the Army and volunteers to keep essential services going. 52 years ago (1970) Members of the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed students at Kent State University during a demonstration against the bombing of Cambodia by US forces. Four students were killed and nine wounded.
