Australian cricket legend Andrew Symonds has tragically passed away in a car crash. News Corp, via australia.au, says that his family have 'confirmed his passing, and appreciated peoples' sympathy and best wishes, and asked that their privacy be respected'. The 46-year-old was involved in a single car accident near the city of Townsville at around 11pm on Saturday May 14 (local time), approximately 50 kilometres from Symonds’ home in Townsville. Reports suggest that his car rolled after leaving the road near the Alice River Bridge. Queensland Police released a statement that read: "Early information indicates, shortly after 11pm the car was being driven on Hervey Range Road, near Alice River Bridge when it left the roadway and rolled. "Emergency services attempted to revive the 46-year-old driver and sole occupant, however, he died of his injuries. The Forensic Crash Unit is investigating." Symonds played 26 Tests for Australia and will widely be remembered for the way he burst onto the scene at the 2003 World Cup when he emerged on the international stage with a match-winning hundred against Pakistan. His blistering hundreds against England and India will also be remembered for a long time. After retiring, Symonds worked as a commentator for Fox Sports, enhancing his reputation as a fan’s favourite even further despite not even being on the cricket pitch. Fans enjoyed his expert knowledge but also were able to fall in love with his humour and wit. Tributes have quickly emerged from those who worked alongside Symonds. Retired player and now coach Jason Gillespie wrote on Twitter: “Horrendous news to wake up to. Utterly devastated. We are all gonna miss you mate.” Fellow commentator Kerry O’Keeffe also wrote: “Hearts broken again. If we were Ted Lasso, he was our Roy Kent, called it straight, didn’t bluff, was true to himself, loyal, quirky. Will be missed forever.”
