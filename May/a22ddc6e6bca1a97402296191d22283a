53-year-old Texan actress Ren√©e, who both acted and executive produced on the recent NBC TV series The Thing About Pam, dazzled in a black Gucci suit last night. The star had been attending an NBC Universal For You Consideration event for the network her series was screened on - and she made sure she looked nothing short of sensational for the occasion. She paired the elegantly tailored trouser suit with a pair of classic black heels for a dramatic monochrome look. The star was scarcely recognisable in her slim-line suit, in comparison to her appearance on The Thing About Pam. In the series, she'd donned a prosthetic fat suit to channel her murderous character, Pam Hupp. The story was based on the real-life ruthless life insurance administrator who'd killed her victims out of profit-fuelled greed. With her fat suit gone, and a smile painted across her face while she boasted smooth and wrinkle-free skin, the multi Oscar award winner was projecting a very different image on the red carpet yesterday.
