Nicola Sturgeon made the comments after she met with Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill in Edinburgh on Friday. Of the topics discussed the two leaders spoke about issues surrounding Brexit and the ongoing row over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Scottish National Party (SNP) leader said the Brexit process has “brought to the fore some very fundamental questions” over the system of governance in the UK.  She said: “Scotland, and indeed Northern Ireland - we both voted against Brexit but we are both now dealing with the very negative consequences of Brexit. “That really brings to the fore that that system of Government that’s been at play in the UK for some time now is not serving all of our interests. “You hear these questions in Scotland, you hear them in Northern Ireland. Increasingly, you’re hearing these questions being asked in Wales, as well. I don’t think these questions are going to go away.” So, do you agree with Ms Sturgeon that Brexit has shown flaws in the system used to govern the British Isles?
