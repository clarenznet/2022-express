Royal living may look easy for Kate Middleton, but being a Duchess has many peculiar restrictions. The Duchess of Cambridge has been praised by fans for her poise and decorum, and for always acting like a perfect royal. Kate’s beautiful fashion and down-to-earth personality have set her up to succeed as a future Queen Consort. Being Kate Middleton certainly has its perks, but the Duchess is also restricted by a long list of royal rules that she must follow. She is often praised for taking royal life in her stride and following royal protocols perfectly. From selfie bans to bedtime etiquette, there are many bizarre orders Kate must follow. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, Kate is not allowed to eat potatoes.

However, other reports have shown she is a fan of pasta, even making homemade pasta to celebrate Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday in 2020. Royal guidelines state the family should avoid risky foods in public.  Shellfish could give the royals food poisoning, and therefore Kate would also be banned from consuming this. Royal fans are also not allowed to touch the royals. Slinging a hand around the Duchess’ shoulder could land the person and Kate in trouble. Casual touches by strangers are a big taboo to senior members of the Royal Family. The Duchess also cannot go to bed before the Queen.  Kate and her fellow royals must not go to bed before Her Majesty. In his book ‘The Royals in Australia’, former private secretary to the Queen, Sir William Heseltine, said: “Nobody felt it right to go to bed before the Queen did. “For Diana the long royal evenings were agony. She’d excuse herself and go to bed, which was thought to be rather bad form.” Selfies are not allowed to be taken with any member of the Royal Family.  There are no selfies on Kate’s Instagram account which she shares with her husband, Prince William. Royal commentator Victoria Arbiter told Insider: “Royals would always rather have a personal interaction than have people clamouring for selfies.” Kate is not supposed to sign autographs, for fear of her signature being forged. And she must accept all gifts graciously, but the Queen decides which gifts should be kept and where they should be placed.
