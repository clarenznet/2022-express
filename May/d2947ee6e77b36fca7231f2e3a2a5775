This year marks the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the bank holiday weekend is happening on Friday 3 June. To celebrate the royal event, Royal Mint has unveiled new Platinum Jubilee coins that are the perfect keepsake. These special and rare coins were created with royal historian and author, Professor Kate Williams, and it’s the Royal Mint’s largest coin collection to date. The collection includes rare historic sets and there are also a limited amount of Celebration Sovereigns that were struck on 6 February 2022. Plus, the collection also includes the first ever UK 50p coin issued by The Royal Mint to celebrate a royal event. But be quick, stocks are limited and coins are already selling out. Highlights from the range include the UK 50p coin which features a Platinum Jubilee portrait of the queen. It has a Brilliant Uncirculated coin that also features bold graphic design by agency Osborne Ross on the reverse. It’s available here on the Royal Mint for £7. Other standouts include the UK £5 coin which has a beautiful decorative design of the queen on horseback. It’s available for £10 on Royal Mint. Also in stock is a rare 1977 Elizabeth II Jubilee Silver Proof Coin which celebrates the 25th anniversary of the queen. A historical item, it’s available on Royal Mint for £100. Make sure to order as soon as possible as the coins will be shipped in early June. Here are rare sets from the range. Buy on Royal Mint (£1,150) Buy on Royal Mint (£13) Buy on Royal Mint (£1,800)
