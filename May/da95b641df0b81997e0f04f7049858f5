Amanda Holden, 51, put her fabulously toned legs on display as she donned a skirt that showed them off to full effect. The Britain’s Got Talent star opted for a midi skirt and blouse ensemble for her day at the office. She took to Instagram earlier today to showcase her outfit in view of her 1.8 million followers. In a Boomerang clip, Amanda could be seen sitting in an office chair while crossing and uncrossing her legs in a loop. In a follow up post, Amanda posed up a storm for pictures with her hands on her hips as she looked away from the camera. Amanda paired her blue and yellow floral print skirt, which featured a daring thigh-high split, with a flowy pussy bow blouse in cream. She finished off the polished look with a pair of black patent stilettos, while styling her butter blonde tresses in voluminous waves.
