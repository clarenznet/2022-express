Many of the faithful had come from thousands miles away to see their heroes take on Real Madrid tonight. A police spokesman said: "We expect upwards of 60,000 Liverpool fans and about two thirds will be without tickets." Arash Shahideh, 57, from Philadelphia in the US was with his two sons. He said: "We had to be here and started to make plans before the semifinal." Kathalina Sanchez, 35, is from Colombia and a fan of the Reds' Colombian striker Luis Diaz. She said: "I hope he scores." And the family of a fan who tragically died during a Champions League match at Anfield is heading to Paris to keep a promise to go to a Euro final together. Terry Judge, 63, collapsed moments before kick-off against Benfica last month. Now son Oliver, 19, has flown out with his mum Louise - even though neither has a ticket. Louise, 50, said: "We just want to do big cheers for him and give him the best send off."
