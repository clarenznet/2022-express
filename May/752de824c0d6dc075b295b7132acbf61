The disorder, which happened in Liverpool city centre on Saturday evening, saw several men spill out from what appears to be a bar or restaurant onto a street. Shoppers and drinkers looked on in horror as the group scrapped in the middle of the road. Cars had to avoid the brawling yobs. The footage, which has been shared online, shows one of the men jump on the bonnet of a car which was forced to stop in the road. Kicks and punches are seen being exchanged in the street. The man on the car bonnet eventually climbs down from the car and walks around appearing to celebrate after his opponents walk away. It is understood the brawl involved two men against a larger group of people, Liverpool Echo reports.   A group of women appear to try and stop the brawl. One woman in a green top throws her arms in the air in a gesture to try and stop the men fighting. The man who jumped on the car bonnet had a large cut above his eye, it is said. The fighting appears to have broken out as large crowds gathered in the city following Liverpool's victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup Final. The ECHO has sent the footage to Merseyside Police. Posting on social media, people reacted in disgust to the ugly behaviour. One man posted on Facebook: "It’s the people drinking in the pubs all day that's the problem." Another shared: "Where were the police when this was happening?" A third Facebook user stated: "What a bunch of morons. It makes a show of our city of Liverpool. These idiots need to grow up." One resigned Liverpool resident said: "Fighting happens in every city nowadays."
