Arts Council England has ring-fenced the cash from National Lottery Project Grants. But this is the last year that funding will be available to small venues from the Supporting Grassroots Live Music fund, launched in 2019.  Claire Mera-Nelson, of the Arts Council England, said: "Live music venues are important and beloved community assets. "They play a vital role in developing new talent and providing a space for audiences to develop a passion for music."
