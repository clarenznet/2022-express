ChelseaÂ owner Roman Abramovich has penned his final goodbyes to Blues supporters with Todd Boehly's takeover almost complete. Abramovich has been forced to sell the west London outfit by the UK Government because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   "But then something very human and normal took place with the players not here [during the March internationals]. There were also different influences to them, maybe more thoughts about the situation in general and now the situation has been very long. The players want to feel competitive and know what's happening next season. "Some players like Toni [Antonio Rudiger] then decided to change the club, so every day it gets a bit more difficult. It's not impossible, but it gets more difficult and it does have an influence. We're looking for a level where we're still competitive and win games. It's still no excuse but it is for sure a reason [for the form]. "These are positive signs and it feels like it's coming to an end which will give us the possibilities to act [in the summer transfer market] but right now, we're not yet at that moment."
