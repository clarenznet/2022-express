Roderick, a one-year-old American Bulldog crossbreed, is on the RSPCA's "special" animals list. He came into the care of the charity's Tameside and Glossop branch after being "bullied" by the other dog in his previous home and is now keeping his paws crossed for a forever family. The RSPCA said in a statement: "This is Roderick who is, as you can see, a pretty big boy. "Sadly, the other dog in his home just didn't get on with poor Roderick and bullied him. "As a result this lovely-natured boy now needs his own special family." Roderick is looking for a new owner who has experience of large dogs. He will need lots of exercise and to be taken to training classes. After being bullied in his last home, Roderick would like to be an only pet.
