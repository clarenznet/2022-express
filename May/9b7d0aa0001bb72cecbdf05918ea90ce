The Met Office has issued a ‘Yellow’ thunderstorm warning starting today at 7pm. This is expected to bring disruption in some areas, with travel set to be affected. Where this takes place, road closures will be expected, or, at best, driving conditions will become more difficult. Lightning strikes could also cause delays and cancellations to train and bus services. Residential and business properties are expected to be impacted alongside travel services. Power cuts are also possible. The warning covers four major regions and local authorities. These are the East Midlands, East of England, London and South East England and South West England. People in these areas have been advised to seek shelter if possible. The Met Office said Britons should unplug any non-essential appliances if a surge protector is not being used before the thunderstorm.

Once it has finished, those in the affected areas should avoid downed power lines. Those planning to drive in heavy rain and strong winds have also been advised to allow for extra time for their journeys. The Met Office said: “Even moderate rain can reduce your ability to see and be seen. “A good rule of thumb is ‘if it’s time for your wipers, it’s time to slow down’.” The warning spills over into tomorrow morning, on May 18. It is set to end at 3am, though this could be subject to change.
