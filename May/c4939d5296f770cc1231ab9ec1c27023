If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Several supermarkets and high street food stores are recalling several chicken products due to the risk of salmonella. Symptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps. The supermarket has taken the precautionary measure of recalling the below products as they may contain Salmonella. Sainsbury’s said: “We are asking customers who have purchased the above products not to consume them and to return them to their nearest Sainsbury's store, where they will receive a full refund. “For any concerns or queries or if you are unable to return the product to store, then please visit our website Sainsburys.co.uk/help or contact our Careline on 0800 636262 “No other products have been affected by this issue. “Sainsbury's would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.” READ MORE: Lidl recalls popular beer as it contains sulphur dioxide 'Don't drink' Sainsbury's is recalling the following: by Sainsbury's Chicken, Bacon & Caesar Wrap, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken Fajita Triple Wrap, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Spring on the Lemon Chicken Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 TTD Greek Chicken & Tzatziki Premium Wrap, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken and Bacon Sub Roll, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Cafe Chicken & Bacon Topped Toastie, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Jerk Chicken Wrap, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken & Sweetcorn Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken with Pork, Sage & Onion Stuffing Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken & Bacon Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken Salad Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Chicken Triple Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Coronation Chicken Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Thai Red Chicken Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Classic Triple Sandwich, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's Gluten Free Chicken Caesar Wrap, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 14 2022 by Sainsbury's chargrilled chicken slices 160g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's chargrilled chicken slices 300g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's firecracker chicken slices 160g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Garlic & Herb Chicken Breast Slices 180g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Kansas City BBQ Wings 486g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Flamegrilled Chicken Grills 180g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Sage & Onion Chicken Breast Slice 180g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Chargrilled Salt & Chilli Thigh Fillets 150g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Grilled Tandoori Chicken Thigh Fillets 150g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Piri Piri Chicken Mini Fillets 170g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Mexican Chicken Mini Fillets 170g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Flamegrilled Chicken Mini Fillets 170g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 20 2022 by Sainsbury's Cajun Chicken Grills 180g, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 12 2022 by Sainsbury's Classic Sandwich Platter, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 12 2022 by Sainsbury's Meat Sandwich Platter, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 12 2022 by Sainsbury's Gluten Free Sandwich Platter, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 12 2022 by Sainsbury's Wrap Platter, with all use by codes from May 3 to May 12 2022 DON'T MISS...Woman who was 'eating herself to death' shed 20st - here's how [PICTURES]'Best solution’ to fine lines and wrinkles according to skin expert [INTERVIEW]Kate and William ‘looking to emulate Harry and Meg’ with rebranding? [BODY LANGUAGE] Aldi said: “The products listed above are being recalled due to the possible presence of Salmonella.
