He was attending a Jubilee tea party at Sweetcroft care home during a constituency visit to Uxbridge, west London. Mr Johnson poured tea and enjoyed cake with the residents in a decorated room. Meanwhile a small band of Tory backbenchers called for Mr Johnson to quit following Sue Gray's report into lockdown rule breaking. John Baron, Stephen Hammond and David Simmonds said they believed he must stand down now the details of so-called Partygate had been laid bare.  Mr Baron said: "For me the most serious charge against the Prime Minister is that of knowingly misleading Parliament".   Mr Simmonds said: "It is clear that while the Government and our policies enjoy the confidence of the public, the PM does not". They follow Julian Sturdy, who began the trickle of Tory voices demanding Mr Johnson's exit after the report was published on Wednesday.
