Royal commentator Camilla Tominey said it was important the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not take away the limelight from working members of the family, including Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. She said it was important next month’s celebrations were about the Queen. Speaking to The Telegraph: “You can include the Sussexes, but you don’t want some sort of Harry and Meghan side show going on when the main event must be HMQ the Queen and equally there will be other members of the Royal Family who are still doing the daily grind who will resent being overshadowed by Harry and Meghan even if they don’t admit it. “You’re not going to want to have the likes of Princess Anne and the Earl and Countess of Wessex for instance who day in day out plant trees, unveil plaques and go to the openings of royal envelopes only to have the media completely focus on Harry and Meghan who aren’t playing a role at all in the so called family.” Her comments come ahead of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, taking place from June 2 to June 5, which Harry and Meghan said they were "excited and honoured" to attend. But the pair will not join the Queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace because that privilege is only reserved for working members of the Firm. This will be the first time the Queen meets Prince Harry's daughter, Lilibet Diana. Follow below for live updates...
