Passengers leaving the UK have been stuck for hours as the Traffic Assessment Project causes "misery". Remoaners took to Twitter to blame Brexit for the delays, with user @ApesPlague saying: "Brexit isn't working! #BrexitHasFailed." The Port of Dover said it is working "as quickly as possible" to minimise delays.

What a total Brexidiot! #BrexitHasFailed." FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
