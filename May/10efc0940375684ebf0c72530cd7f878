Princess Anne attended yet another garden party at Buckingham Palace. Today, she attended with her husband, Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence. The party was titled the ‘Not Forgotten Association Garden Party’. The Princess Royal, 71, wore a lilac silk knee-length dress for the occasion. This was then layered with a multi-coloured green and lilac long-sleeved coat. The floral coat featured buttons along the front of it. It also had a wide collar and lapel with the same floral print.

The stud earrings featured one massive pearl in a sphere shape and looked lovely on the Princess. Princess Anne also wore a very poignant brooch for the occasion. The red circular brooch was titled: “The not forgotten association for the ex-service disabled.” Underneath, there was a little scroll which was part of the brooch that said ‘Patron’. This is because Anne is the Patron of the Not Forgotten organisation. She always wears this red brooch whenever she attends events in their honour. Today’s garden party is in honour of the Not Forgotten organisation. Anne paired the dress with a light lilac wide hat, that featured a silk bow tied around the centre. She wore light pink lipstick and minimal makeup to not detract from the very colourful outfit. For footwear, Anne wore her sensible kitten heels in black leather. She paired this with a simple black leather handbag. Anne also wore navy woollen gloves for the occasion. The Princess Royal also brought an umbrella with her for the garden party, especially after yesterday was very rainy. The umbrella's handle featured a duck’s head, so was a unique choice for Anne.
