Rebekah Vardy, 40, has spent some quality time with Leicester City footballer husband Jamie Vardy, 35, following her dramatic exit from the courtroom on Thursday. The couple could be seen sharing a hug and a kiss following the Premier League match between Leicester City and Southampton at The King Power Stadium on Sunday. Rebekah was accompanied in the stands by her daughter, Olivia, one, who also took the pitch with her dad in a full Leicester City kit. She sported a casual look wearing a pair of jeans teamed with a top and baby blue blazor. Her brunette tresses hung loosely over her shoulders as she added a pair of sunglasses. Jamie and Rebekah appeared in good spirits as they played with Olivia, who’s shirt had the word “Daddy” emblazoned on the back, and talked to each other. Rebekah is currently suing Coleen Rooney, wife of Manchester United's all-time leading scorer Wayne Rooney, for libel. Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking information from her private Instagram story in October 2019. The pair's lawyers delivered their final statements on Friday as they await the final verdict.
