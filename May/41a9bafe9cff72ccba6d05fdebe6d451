Everton boss Frank Lampard has been blasted by Graeme Souness over his tactical decisions in the 3-2 loss to Brentford on Sunday afternoon - with the Scottish pundit claiming a 'negative seed' was planted in his players' minds by Lampard's decison-making. The Toffees, who needed a win to ensure their place in next season's Premier League, thought safety was on the horizon when Richarlison put them 1-0 up. But jubilation turned into frustration once Jarrod Branthwaite was sent off for bringing down Ivan Toney. They went into the break 2-1 to the good but being down to 10 men brought about problems as they faltered to a 3-2 defeat. And Souness criticised Lampard for his half-time tactics, claiming it put his side 'psychologically on the backfoot'. "They’ve put themselves back into a difficult situation," Souness said on Sky. "You feel for Branthwaite getting sent off. He was unlucky because it happened so quickly, it is a sending off by the letter of the law.  "The other sending off is so unavoidable. Everton were doing okay. Half-time comes, Frank sits them down and goes over how they’re going to play. "They just sat three or four yards deeper because of what the manager says. Psychologically for the players, they were on the backfoot. "You have to say, what they said would be correct, but it plants a negative seed in the players’ head." The result leaves the club 16th, just two points ahead of Burnley and only one ahead of Leeds. The Blues take on Crystal Palace at Goodison Park on Thursday before a daunting final-day trip to the Emirates to play Arsenal beckons for Lampard's men.  If Burnley take four points from their final two games, Everton would need a win against Palace or Arsenal for them to stay ahead of the Clarets.
