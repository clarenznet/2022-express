Penny Lancaster caused heads to turn this evening as she took to the red carpet in a leopard-print mini dress and a pair of thigh-high black boots. The wife of rocker Rod Stewart, 51, dazzled as she attended the first performance of ABBA Voyage.  Penny was all smiles as she struck a pose on the red carpet of the glitzy event, which marked 40 years since ABBA's last performance in the UK. The mother of two dazzled in a leopard-print mini dress which hugged her curves in all the right places. Penny cinched in her tiny waist with a black belt and accessorised with a black scarf tied fashionably around her neck. But it was her over-the-knee black boots which garnered the most attention as they added inches to the supermodel's height. Showcasing her long limbs, Penny grinned as she clasped her black and gold handbag close to her. She wore her blonde dresses in big curls which fell down her shoulders. The model appeared on the red carpet on her own and without her rock husband, Rod Stewart.
