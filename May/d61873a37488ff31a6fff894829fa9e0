 If successful, this will remove a further 24 tonnes of plastic from circulation per year, meaning customers will be able to buy more of their everyday items plastic-free. Richard Gorman, Plastics and Packaging Director at Aldi, said: “Removing unnecessary plastic from our multipack of beans is another step forward in our commitment to reduce plastic across our ranges. These changes are the latest in Aldi’s efforts to reduce and remove unnecessary plastic from its products. The supermarket has pledged to halve the volume of plastic packaging it uses by 2025, which will see it remove 74,000 tonnes of plastic from circulation.
