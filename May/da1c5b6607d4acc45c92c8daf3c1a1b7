Andrew Selley, boss of Bidfood, said schools may also use cheaper ingredients, adding: "The situation is going to lead to difficult decisions for school caterers, which is not good for children." He said baked goods are 30 percent more expensive due to wheat price hikes and the cost of sunflower oil is double that of a year ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. It comes as M&S chairman Archie Norman said food prices could soar 10 percent this year.
