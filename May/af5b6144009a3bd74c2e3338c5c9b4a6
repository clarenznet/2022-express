This comes amid mounting concerns over the Queen's health. A royal source confirmed that the 96-year-old monarch travelled to Balmoral yesterday. It is understood that the trip will act as a short break before the celebrations begin on June 2.  However, she often travels to Scotland at this time of year. The Queen is likely to have a limited role in most of the Jubilee celebrations as a result of her health. The monarch is said to be suffering from "episodic mobility issues", a palace source said. The Queen's presence at each Jubilee engagement will only be confirmed on the day of the event and she is expected to delegate a large number of duties to senior members of the Royal Family. The delegation of duties to other senior members of the Royal Family has become increasingly common in recent months. The Queen was forced to cancel her appearance at the State Opening of Parliament earlier this month as a result of health issues, with Prince Charles delivering the Queen's Speech on her behalf. He was accompanied by Prince William, who attended the event for the first time. Constitutional expert Bob Morris told the Mirror that William and Charles' roles in the ceremony were "unprecedented" but are likely to continue for the rest of her reign. UPDATES TO FOLLOW...
