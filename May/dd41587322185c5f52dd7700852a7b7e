Parents and families have been warned about the friction between gangs in Camberwell, south London, which have shared threats online ahead of the Platinum Jubilee weekend. The chilling menaces include threats of "stabbings" and "acid attacks" planned in the district's Burgess Park on Thursday - when a funfair is already scheduled. One TikTok user warned rival gang members toÂ "rob or be robbed" in relation to the rumoured "postcode war," My London reports. Patrick Campbell, a youth mentor and chef, wrote on Facebook: "Please everyone, tell your family (especially young ones) to AVOID burgess park on the 2nd of June. If you have teenagers at home, you may have already heard of the 'postcode war' that had been planned for that day. Young people are being encouraged to turn up with knives, imitation guns, machetes, etc. "If you have the TikTok app, search 'burgess park 2nd June', and you will be shocked by the things being spread around. I have searched on Tik Tok myself and I am truly shocked with what I have seen. Please share this and get this across to many parents as much as possible. Hopefully the met police see this and get the park closed or get enough officers there to safeguard these young people." Community workers, charities and church leaders have all been called upon to share the warning in the hope it will help "vulnerable children" from attending the Jubilee funfair. A similar funfair at the nearby Blackheath Park in April was marred by disorder. A stabbing was reported at the attraction. Metropolitan Police told My London it is aware of the latest videos and will respond accordingly.
