Bruce Springsteen is returning to live concerts in 2023 from early February and he couldn’t be more excited. The Boss said: “After six years, I’m looking forward to seeing our great and loyal fans next year. And I’m looking forward to once again sharing the stage with the legendary E Street Band. See you out there, next year — and beyond.” All tickets for Bruce Springsteen's tour are available on Ticketmaster here. The last time Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band toured together was way back in 2017, following the end of their 14 month The River Tour. The Boss and group have since performed live together on Saturday Night Live in December 2020, where they launched live versions of a couple of tracks from their most recent album, Letter To You. The record marked the band’s first time recording live together in decades and saw it hit No 1 in 11 countries. Members of The E Street Band are: Roy Bittan – piano, synthesizer; Nils Lofgren – guitar, vocals; Patti Scialfa – guitar, vocals; Garry Tallent – bass guitar; Stevie Van Zandt – guitar, vocals; and Max Weinberg – drums; with Soozie Tyrell – violin, guitar, vocals; Jake Clemons – saxophone; and Charlie Giordano – keyboards. So far Bruce Springsteen has announced his European dates for his 2023 tour, while shows in the UK and US will be announced at a later date. His stadium tour kicks off in Barcelona on April 28 next year, while a second North American leg will commence that August.
