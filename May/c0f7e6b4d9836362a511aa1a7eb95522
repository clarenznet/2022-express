Ania Jedrkowiak, 21, bled to death from multiple wounds near a church and school as paramedics vainly tried to save her.  Scotland Yard revealed a man, 29, has been held on suspicion of the murder early on Tuesday. Detectives said the arrest was "very significant" and he and Ania, from Poland, knew each other. A man of 20, who had been detained on suspicion of the murder in Ealing, west London, was released with no further action.
