The Folding Lady has over four million followers on TikTok. While talking to Phillip Schofield and Rochelle Humes on This Morning, the social media sensation started by saying that "we are not here for perfection" and that achieving "an Instagram perfect looking bed" is not the goal. She explained: "I used to work in retail and I just loved folding. "That's how I started on TikTok." Sophie then showed viewers how to easily fold a fitted sheet. She said: "You start with your hands in the corners, clap your hands together, and fold the corners over.

"Then you're just going to repeat the same again and fold the corners over." Sophie then advised viewers to place the sheet on the bed or "on a surface". The next step is to "try to make a rectangle".  She said: "Fold it in thirds. "Always make sure you're leaving gaps because that will keep all the edges in." "That's definitely space-saving!" said Rochelle Humes admiring the nicely folded bed sheet. Sophie continued with the bedding: "When folding the bedding, you first fold it in half and half again. "Then I'm going to fold it into thirds. "You tuck it into itself. "And then you put the folded sheet inside the little 'pocket' you created in the bedding." Phillip said: "Oh wow, this is good!" Phillip said.  "This will also save you time," Sophie added. Phillip said: "This is enormously satisfying!" "This is really good for kids' bedding because it's all together so you don't have to look for everything!" Rochelle added.
