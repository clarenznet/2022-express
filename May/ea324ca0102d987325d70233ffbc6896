Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner showcased some exemplary maternity style when she and husband Joe Jonas made an appearance at this year's 2022 Met Gala. Sophie was all smiles at the event, tenderly cradling her tummy while clad in a gothic-style floor-length dress. Her long auburn-tinted hair cascaded loosely down her back, contrasted vibrantly by her ruby red lips. Meanwhile, her dress was accented by a beaded portion across the front. She wore flat black sandals to keep the pressure off her feet while awaiting the birth of her second child with Joe. Her partner, who shot to fame as part of the Jonas Brothers and made headlines for wearing a chastity ring and claiming he would not have sex before marriage, was equally stylish at tonight's event. He showed up wearing a white fitted waistcoat with a contrasting black collar. It featured a long cape section which trailed dramatically on the red carpet behind him while he and Sophie strode out to pose for the cameras. He paired it with black trousers and shoes. The couple, who have been married since 2019 when they tied the knot at an upscale French chateau, turned heads as soon as they arrived at the star-studded event.
