Gary Butcher, 55, has been reported missing from HMP North Sea Camp - the same jail in Boston, Lincolnshire, from which Paul Robson, another sex offender, absconded just three months ago. Police are now appealing to find Butcher, who is serving a life sentence for aggravated burglary. Butcher is described as a white male with a stocky build, with brown/grey hair and blue eyes. He has a swallow tattoo on his right arm and a “Phillip-Trina” tattoo on his left arm. Detective Inspector Paul Coleman, senior investigating officer at Lincolnshire Police, has released a plea for information in finding Butcher, who may have travelled to the Leicestershire area. Det Insp Coleman told Lincolnshire Live: “We are appealing for help to locate Gary Butcher who was reported missing from North Sea Camp this morning. “If you have any information to his current whereabouts, please contact us immediately. If you do see him, please do not approach him and instead, call us on 101 quoting incident 37 of 31 st May and if it’s an emergency, dial 999.” A force spokesperson added: "We are appealing for help to locate Gary Butcher, aged 55, who absconded from HMP North Sea Camp in Boston. "Butcher, a convicted sex offender, was reported missing just after 5:30am today (31st May). He is serving a life sentence for aggravated burglary. "He is described as a white male with a stocky build, with brown/grey hair and blue eyes. He has a swallow tattoo on his right arm and a “Phillip-Trina” tattoo on his left arm."   When Robson, 56, went missing in February, police warned not to approach the sex fiend, describing him "dangerous to women and children". He was eventually found four days later in Skegness, Lincolnshire, more than 20 miles away. Robson had sexually assaulted his victim at knifepoint.
