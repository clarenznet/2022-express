Under Tory party rules, a vote of confidence in the leader must be held if 15 percent of MPs submit letters to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee calling for one. It means Mr Johnson will face a vote on his leadership if 54 of his colleagues send in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who has headed up the committee since 2020. He also previously held the position from 2010 to 2019. Up to 30 Conservative parliamentarians have criticised the Prime Minister in the wake of the Sue Gray report into illegal lockdown gatherings in Downing Street. But many have stopped short of confirming if they have submitted a no confidence letter. Leading Brexiteer and former loyalist Dame Andrea Leadsom today attacked Mr Johnson for his "unacceptable failings of leadership". However, she failed to confirm if she had sent in a letter, simply saying: "Each of my Conservative colleagues and I must now decide individually on what is the right course of action that will restore confidence in our Government." Letters are anonymous meaning it is impossible to tell exactly how many Tory MPs have written to Sir Graham. The Daily Express has compiled the definitive list of those who have gone public about putting in a letter. READ MORE:Â 'Unacceptable failings!'
