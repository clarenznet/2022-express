Dame Joan Collins, 89, attended a Platinum Jubilee party with her husband Percy Gibson, 57. But the legendary actress admitted she suffered a wardrobe malfunction while at the event. The Dynasty icon donned a lace dress with a feather boa as she stepped out to host the celebration at Langan's Brasserie in Mayfair on Tuesday. Joan looked as glamorous as ever in the white shift dress with delicate lace sleeves as she was helped out of the car by her husband of 20 years. She wore her brunette locks piled high on top of her head in pinned curls, adding lashing of black eyeliner and pink lipstick. Joan slipped into a glitzy pair of white stiletto heels and accessorised with some statement pearl earrings for her opulent look. She later revealed on Instagram, that the zip on her dress broke and her husband rushed home and got her another dress to change into. In view of her 277,000 followers, Joan penned: "A major #wardrobemalfunction at @hellomag #redwhiteandblue #platinumjubilee party at @langansbrasserie - while laughing at @tvsrichardarnold joke, my zipper burst! #ahubby to the rescue dashed home and found another #whitedress in the wardrobe." GMB's Richard Arnold penned: "A fabulous night." Tracey added: "You look fabulous in both." Joan changed into another white dress but this time it did not include any lace on the design. The on-screen star and her beau were seen leaving the event holding hands.
