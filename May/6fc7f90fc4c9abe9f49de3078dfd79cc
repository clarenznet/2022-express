There is slow traffic on M25 clockwise between J9 A243 (Leatherhead) and J12 M3, according to the AA. An earlier crash on the motorway between Cobham Services and J10 A3 (Wisley Interchange) has led to queuing traffic. Cars were stopped on the clockwise carriageway but all lanes have since been reopened. Drivers are facing further delays on the M25 clockwise between J13 A30 (Staines) and J15 M4. Meanwhile, motorists are stuck in tailbacks on the M25 anticlockwise at J23 A1(M) (South Mimms) due to a rolled over car. All lanes have now been reopened following the incident.  There is heavy traffic on the anticlockwise carriageway between J17 A412 Denham Way (Maple Cross) and J16 M40. There is also some queueing traffic on M25 anticlockwise at the Dartford Tunnel with congestion to halfway back to J3 M20 (Swanley Interchange). The congestion comes as people are making getaways for half term. It also comes ahead of the bank holiday Platinum Jubilee weekend, with celebrations kicking off on Thursday.  The travel chaos at the beginning of the half-term break is not just affecting motorists. EasyJet and tui have announced a number of flight cancellations in a blow to holidaymakers. Travel company tui said a "small number" of flights had been cancelled, blaming "various operational and supply chain issues". Meanwhile, EasyJet announced it will cancel more than 200 flights over the next 10 days.  The airline said the cancellations would affect about 24 flights per day from London's Gatwick airport between May 28 and June 6. Elsewhere, Liverpool FC supporters travelling to the Champions League final and families embarking on half-term getaways faced long queues at the Port of Dover and UK airports. Thousands of fans descended on the Kent port on Friday to board cross-Channel ferries en route to Paris for Saturday's match. Airline passengers were also stuck in lengthy queues at airports such as Gatwick, Manchester, Stansted and Bristol.
