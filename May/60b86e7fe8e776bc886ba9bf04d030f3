It's hard to believe, but Quordle is celebrating 100 daily puzzles. Like Wordle on steroids, Quordle doesn't task players with figuring out one word, but four - and in just nine guesses. It's every bit as hard as it sounds, which is why Express Online is back with another selection of spoiler-free hints to help you crack today's milestone teaser. Just head to the bottom of the page for today's clues. Good luck! Quordle challenges players to figure out four different words in just nine attempts. Much like Wordle, you'll need to pay attention to the colour of the tiles if you're to succeed. If the tiles turn grey, then the letter doesn't appear in the word you are guessing. If it's yellow then the letter appears, just not in that particular spot. Finally, green tiles mean the letter appears in that exact position. The twist with Quordle is that when you guess a word it will appear in all four answer boxes. You can solve them in any order, so keep an eye on everything, because you may be able to knock out the third word before you've guessed the first one. One strategy is to get as many vowels in your opening guess as possible. Try words like ADIEU or AUDIO in your first attempt, as these letters will appear in more words. If you're not able to solve the first Quordle word in your second guess, then choose a word with five completely different letters in order to maximise your chances of solving each puzzle.
