The Russian President apologised to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett for comments made by his Foreign Minister. In remarks that drew international condemnation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov falsely claimed that Adolf Hitler had some "Jewish blood". Israel in particular had spoken out against the comments, saying it was an "unforgivable" falsehood. A news release from Mr Bennett's office said: "The Prime Minister accepted President Putin’s apology for Lavrov’s remarks and thanked him for clarifying the President’s attitude towards the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust."
