  Lady Victoria wore a floor-length gown made out of a pale gold, shimmering material. The garment exposed her waist and most of her toned tummy, and was tied just above her hips in a knot. There was a tiny bit of material covering up the model’s bust, held together by two thin straps. The dress was completely backless, stopping just above the star’s rear.  The skirt was made out of semi-translucent material, which left very little to the imagination. Lady Victoria accessorised the outfit with a gorgeous, long silver necklace decorated with purple jewels. The model pinned her long blonde locks back in an elegant half-up, half-down hairstyle. She opted for a glamorous makeup look, with long false eyelashes, eyeliner and some pink lipstick.
