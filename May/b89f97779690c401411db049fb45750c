The best way to level-up Britain is to level-up this nation's youth. Extra help at the right time can ensure a child flourishes at school, gets on to a good university course or apprenticeship, and gains the skills the job market demands. Families across the UK fully understand the difference that tutoring can make, as demonstrated by the willingness of those parents who can afford it to pay for help outside the classroom to enable their children to succeed. There are many reasons why traditional lessons and homework alone may not be enough for some pupils to grasp the intricacies of a difficult subject. But we should not give up on any child. This is especially true for youngsters who are in the care system. As the chief executive of Barnardo's writes in today's Sunday Express, earlier help is needed for parents who are struggling. It is tragic - and arguably scandalous - that children in care "are three times less likely to be in education, employment or training by the time they reach 19". A country which cherishes, protects and celebrates its children is one that truly invests in its future and values its greatest natural resource. We can do better, and the plans being pushed forward by Mr Zahawi and his team are the type of bold action we need.  The European Union should not delay in making constructive changes to the post-Brexit trading arrangements so that Northern Ireland is not plunged into deeper instability and denied the opportunities to prosper enjoyed by the rest of the United Kingdom. It was right in the run-up to Britain's departure from the EU to ensure that border checkpoints did not need to be installed between the province and the Republic of Ireland.These would likely have been targeted by so-called "dissident" Republicans. But it is clear that the Northern Ireland protocol agreed at that time has disrupted trade with Great Britain and hit businesses with delays and red tape. The unionist DUP - outraged that the status of Northern Ireland within the UK has been changed without the specific consent of its people - is now refusing to share power with Sinn Fein in the Stormont Government. The UK does not want to scrap the protocol but fix it. EU member states should give negotiators the mandate they need to reform the arrangements without delay - for the good of both the north and south of Ireland and Europe itself.
