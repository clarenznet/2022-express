Germany sought to prevent anti-Russia sentiments from spilling over into the Victory in Europe celebrations over the weekend by imposing a ban on displaying Ukraine's flag. Footage has emerged showing Berlin police seizing a large flag about to be paraded across the Soviet War Memorial in Tiergarten commemorating soldiers who died in the Battle of Berlin. Demonstrators could be seen relinquishing the banner to the officers, who proceeded to scrunch it up and removed it ahead of the memorial service. Berlin Police said they were banning all Russian and Ukrainian flags as well as military music from being included in the event.  In a statement, they said: "The act of remembering, as well as the respect for memorials and monuments, must be preserved against the background of Russiaâ€™s current war of aggression in Ukraine.  "The war must not be allowed to spill over into conflicts or disputes in Berlin beyond the democratic discourse."  But the decision sparked the fury of Ukraine's Ambassador to Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, who branded the move a "slap in the face" of all Ukrainians.

Germany has already come under pressure over its close ties with Moscow, and its high dependency on Russian gas. Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged all support available to Kyiv, making moves to legislate to end Germany's gas imports agreements with Russia. However, Mr Scholz's commitment has been questioned after reports emerged last month claiming he had refused to offer up key military equipment to Ukraine.
