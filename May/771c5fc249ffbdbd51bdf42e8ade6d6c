Manchester United could face a setback in their bid to sign Frenkie de Jong after Barcelona manager Xavi reportedly held talks with the Dutchman over his future.  United are in the hunt for a midfielder given that Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Paul Pogba are all set to leave on free transfers at the end of the season. Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips and De Jong have all been touted as potential additions at Old Trafford after excelling for their respective clubs throughout the season. De Jong rumours have intensified in the last few weeks given that new manager Erik ten Hag coached the star in his time at the Dutch giants. But according to Xavi, the midfield star is a "very important player" for the side from the Nou Camp. And that will likely deter United in their bid to sign him ahead of the upcoming campaign. "He has to be a player that makes the difference and he does," Xavi said.  "There aren't many players with his quality in the world. He's the present and the future [at Barca]. He is a very important player for me. "He's capable, strong and he gets into the box. He has had some excellent games, but he has to be consistent. We had a face-to-face chat this week and it went well. Obviously being taken off is frustrating for him, but I have to look out for the team." De Jong signed for the Blaugrana in 2019 after a superb stint at Ajax. The midfielder joined the Amsterdam-based side in 2015 as an 18-year-old from Willem II, and impressed heavily in his time at the capital.  He was part of the side that got to within touching distance of the Champions League final in 2019 before Lucas Moura's second half hat-trick broke Ajax hearts. Since joining Barcelona, he has 13 goals and 17 assists from central midfield. And United would expect him to replicate those numbers if he was to make the move to the Premier League.
