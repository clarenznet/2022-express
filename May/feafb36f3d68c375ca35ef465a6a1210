UK temperatures have orbited the 20C mark for the last week, igniting the first heatwave of 2022. Wall-to-wall sunshine has dominated since the week began, with forecasters expecting little change over the next few days. The sunshine appears set to push temperatures in some areas past 20C but will also prompt a few dramatic storms. Weather charts show a vast heat plume drifting towards the UK from the east, passing over the Netherlands and France. The plume will briefly graze the southeast, spiking temperatures from late today. Met Office forecasters expect it to drive temperatures in London and Peterborough to 23C by 4pm, the highest in the country. Another five areas will see temperatures of 20C and more around the same time.

The UK weather warnings commence from 7pm on May 18 and last until 3am on May 19 for Southwest England, London and Southeast England, the East of England and East Midlands. Over eight hours, intense thunderstorms could cause "torrential downpours and frequent lightning" with "large hail and strong wind gusts". Central areas in southern England can expect the worst, with up to 25mm (one inch) of rain within an hour. Some badly impacted areas could see up to 40mm of rain within two to three hours. In its warning, the Met Office told people to expect flooding, lightning strikes and a "small chance" that rain could flood homes and businesses.
