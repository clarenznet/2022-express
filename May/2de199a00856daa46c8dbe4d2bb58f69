Our great wartime leader was speaking more than 80 years ago – but his words ring just as true today. The US and Canada remain two sovereign nations with distinct identities, deeply intertwined through their fierce commitment to freedom, democracy and free trade. These are fundamental values upon which Britain was built and which still define us to this day.Now, as we chart a new course for ourselves as an independent trading nation outside the EU, we are developing stronger trade bridges across the Atlantic between our three nations.These ties will strengthen our bonds of prosperity at a time of growing global uncertainty.The challenges of COVID-19 and the impact of the war in Ukraine have underlined the critical importance of strong, diverse supply chains to our collective economic security and exposed vulnerabilities in global sources of energy and food, to name just two.Free trade will play a pivotal role in providing the strength we need to meet these challenges. That is why Britain, the US and Canada are clearing a path to change by calling for long-overdue and much-needed reform of the WTO. In addition, we are defending freedom and free trade against attacks from state and non-state actors through NATO and the Five Eyes intelligence partnership – longstanding cornerstones of our alliance.But, now, we must lead by example by going further and faster in deepening the ties of trade and investment that bind our three great democracies together.Earlier this year, we launched negotiations on an ambitious new free trade agreement with Canada.This Canada 2.0 agreement will aim to slash bureaucracy and enhance trade opportunities in the Canadian market for British firms of all shapes and all sizes while boosting Canadian investment into our economy.This agreement will support jobs, drive growth and deliver more choice and lower prices for British consumers. It will bring our innovators together to develop the green and digital technologies that are reshaping the global economy too. When I visited Canada, I met Provincial Premiers from Alberta to Saskatchewan as well as businesses across the country to deepen ties with those who shape much of the economy, and I heard for myself the fantastic potential of our longstanding trade and investment partnership.And we are showing the same ambition in our work to unlock trade-led growth with the United States – our biggest trading partner and with whom we share a strategic tradition.We want to turbocharge this diverse and dynamic £200bn relationship – which supports more than a million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.Our countries agreed to increase our economic collaboration during our recent joint trade dialogue in Aberdeen.And we are pulling out the stops with our American partners at both federal and state level to lower barriers to growth for our firms, which is why I’m visiting states, from Illinois to Indiana on my travels around America.The Memorandum of Understanding that I’m signing today with Indiana’s Governor Eric Holcomb during my visit is a vital step on this journey. This is the first deal of its kind we have agreed with a US state and is part of the ambitious state-level programme that this Government has championed since 2019. Trade deals of all shapes and sizes take time and careful work; negotiations happen early in the morning, late at night, over weekends and at the last minute! Building and harnessing strong, trusted relationships with counterparts around the world is key.This deal will build a deeper relationship between British and American businesses, from innovation and life sciences to automotive and advanced manufacturing.In so doing, we are building, brick by brick, a bigger, bolder, better trade relationship with the United States that is fit for the future.Only if we remove the barriers blocking growth, can British, American and Canadian businesses hope to surge ahead.Britain, Canada and America are setting an example for the world to follow. Together, we are getting on with the job, laying the ground for a freer, fairer, more secure and sustainable future, growing our economies, creating new jobs, boosting wages and lowering prices.That’s a future we can all believe in – and of which I’m sure Churchill would have approved.
