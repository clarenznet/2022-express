Carol Vorderman has posted a smiling snap wearing a fedora, and sunglasses as she showed herself “stepping up” for Cleft Awareness Week. The Countdown legend teamed a pair of tight leggings with a grey sweater. The age-defying beauty looked fresh-faced as she went make-up free just hours after sharing a photo with her rarely-seen brother. The TV personality, 61, explained that her sibling, 70, had undergone 24 operations in his life as well as having speech therapy. Carol told how Anton had been born with the “severest form” of cleft lip and palate and his mother - who was a single parent - paid for him to have the therapy. The mathematician, who is patron for Clapa Community, is currently taking part in a fundraising challenge Step Up for Clapa for Cleft Awareness Week. The former Countdown whizz, wrote: “Another lovely day adding steps for STEP UP FOR CLAPA @clapacommunity with my lovely brother. “CLEFT AWARENESS WEEK “Anton is 7 years older than me. He was born with a severe cleft lip and palate and we grew up in Prestatyn in North Wales in a tiny flat. “Our parents had split up and our father was nowhere to be seen so Anton was like my ‘little Daddy’. “He looked after me and because he didn't like going out too much as a young boy with cleft he stayed in with me and taught me chess and machinery and mental maths and we would go ‘jumbling’ to jumble sales and we would buy old bits of stuff and thought we had won the lottery!!!! Well, we had in our heads. “So for the last 20 years I've been Patron of CLAPA and he has been Ambassador.”
