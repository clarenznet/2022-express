Liverpool, who are still in the running for a remarkable quadruple after booking their place in the Champions League final midweek, have the chance to go top of the table tonight. Going into the big game against Spurs, Jurgen Klopp's side are just one point behind league leaders Manchester City who play tomorrow.
