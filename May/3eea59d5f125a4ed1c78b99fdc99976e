The Academy for Science and Freedom, at Washington’s Hillsdale College, is expected to be running within months, with the aim of combatting “the recent and widespread abuses of individual and academic freedom made in the name of science”. Professors Martin Kulldorff and Jay Bhattacharya who are involved in the academy were two of the three creators of the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for a focussed protection approach to Covid rather than blanket restrictions. Sir Jeremy Farrar - director of the Wellcome Trust and a senior Sage member - claimed in a recent book that government adviser Dominic Cummings “wanted to run an aggressive press campaign against those behind the Great Barrington Declaration and others opposed to blanket Covid-19 restrictions”. v "What is a social media entity? Is it news? Because if it's news, it can have editorial decisions about what it does and doesn't publish. Or is it a social media platform where it's a host for information? If the latter it doesn't need any regulation. But it does operate a bit like the press because it wants to have editorial decisions over what is and isn't published. Therefore I think it could be overseen by a body a bit like IPSO, which has an ability to look at a complaint and decide whether it is upheld."
