The Strictly Come Dancing professionals were out in full force on Thursday to celebrate Katya Jones’ 33rd birthday. The extravagant bash was held at the home of Dianne Buswell and Joe Sugg and was attended by Katya’s ex Neil Jones, Amy Dowden, Karen Hauer, Gorka Marquez, and many more from the Strictly cast. Sharing a selection of behind-the-scenes snaps from the event, Gorka gave a shout out to hosts Dianne and Joe and apologised to the latter for “ruining his chill day”. Gemma Arkinson’s partner captioned his Instagram post: “Strictly brunch! Lovely afternoon spent with most of the Strictly [family] celebrating Katya’s birthday and the rest of the other birthdays we had during the Tour. Neil's, Dianne and [Graziano]. “Big shout out to @diannebuswell for organizing it all and to @joe_sugg for letting us ruin his chill day at home.” Dianne and Joe’s garden had been decked out with pink and grey decorations, dozens of balloons, a selfie wall and beautifully arranged tables. Katya was also presented with a giant multi-coloured cake as her Strictly co-stars sang Happy Birthday. The Russian dancer also expressed how grateful she was that Dianne and Joe had organised the special day. Commenting on Dianne’s Instagram post, Katya gushed: “I can’t thank you all enough for this beautiful afternoon! "But it was definitely a celebration of all the birthdays with a wonderful group of people! Thank you for hosting us Dianne.”
