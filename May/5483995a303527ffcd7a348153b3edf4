Steph McGovern, 39, looked great in an elegant black gown as she took to the BAFTAs red carpet this afternoon. However, while getting ready for the awards ceremony all didn't go smoothly for the Steph's Packed Lunch star and she had to change her proposed makeup look. Taking to her Instagram story in view of her 87,300 followers, Steph shared a video of herself with a facemask on, while she zoomed into a large cold sore on her lip. She captioned the video: "Yes the b****d is still here. Looks like he's coming to the BAFTAs with me." Steph then shared how she got ready step by step for the day, with the cold sore causing a problem to her proposed makeup look. Posting a closeup of her lip, she captioned the picture: "Changed original makeup plans because of Colin the Cold Sore coming with us." The TV presenter made sure she didn't disappoint with her outfit as she wore a gorgeous black gown to the event. The 39-year-old looked stunning as she posed in a high-neck, sleeveless black gown with a large, satin princess-style skirt. The star wore her blonde tresses in an up-do that included a braid and curl.
