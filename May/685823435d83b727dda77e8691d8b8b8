Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall between 1989 and 2019, has suggested the partygate fallout is being weaponised by Remainers. Speaking in the House of Lords, she said: "I think outside this place, and perhaps some elements of the media that many elements of the public -probably the majority of the public - want to draw a line under all this so we can move on so we can get on with the issues that are really effecting the country. But can I ask the noble lady, does she agree with me that there will be some people who will never ever give up criticising the Prime Minister because they don't like the fact he took us out of the European Union?" Sharing the moment on Twitter, she added: "There are those who are using the Whitehall shenanigans just to try to bring Boris Johnson down because of Brexit." FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
