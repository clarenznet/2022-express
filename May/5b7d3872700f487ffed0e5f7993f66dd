So far Matteo Bocelli has released singles Solo, Close and Dimmi, with Tempo being the latest. The upbeat track from Andrea Bocelli’s son was accompanied by a music video of the 24-year-old galavanting around his native Tuscany and now he’s unveiled a Spanish version of the song, just as he did with Dimmi. Firstly, there’s the music video, but also footage of the rising star playing this take on the piano. Matteo even shared the lyrics on his Instagram page, captioning the video: “I love the Spanish version of the song!” The Spanish version begins: “Dame tu tempo. Sigo el ritmo al que tu vas. Tú ponme la velocidad. Vamos despacio. O más en crescendo. Toda la noche bailará. Al son que tú quieras llevar. Dame tu tempo. Voy a tu tempo.” DON'T MISSMatteo Bocelli makes stunning first solo Italian TV performance WATCH [MATTEO BOCELLI]Andrea Bocelli’s son Matteo Bocelli releases new single Close – WATCH [CLOSE]Andrea Bocelli and kids ‘astonished, overwhelmed’ to perform for Biden [BIDEN] Matteo said of the original Tempo: “It’s finally time to release Tempo, a song that we wrote during my first writing camp in July 2019.
