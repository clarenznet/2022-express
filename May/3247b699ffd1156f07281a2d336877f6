The royal garden party saw veterans of all ages - with the eldest being 102 and the youngest in their 20s - enjoying themselves at the high-profile event. The Palace hosted more than 2,000 guests, and was the first one to be held since the pandemic lockdowns. The Queen gave permission for the annual garden party to take place at Buckingham Palace, although she didn’t attend herself. Instead, she was represented by the Princess Royal, who is a patron of the veterans’ organisation. Princess Anne showed up in a lilac silk knee-length dress and a long sleeve coat, which was the same outfit she wore to Kate and William's 2011 wedding. She smiled and looked very elegant with stunning accessories, including a two-strand pearl necklace paired with pearl earrings. Guests were joined by celebrity supporters including Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke, and presenters Jeremy Vine and Vanessa Feltz. Rosie Thompson, of the Not Forgotten Association, said: "The thing about Not Forgotten is that it brings people of all ages together and all services. It is amazing the bond that they have. "I think a lot of them leave this garden feeling that their services have been valued. Many have been isolated and lonely, especially in the last two years. "To suddenly be given an invitation to come to Buckingham Palace and to meet our patron just makes them feel really special.”
