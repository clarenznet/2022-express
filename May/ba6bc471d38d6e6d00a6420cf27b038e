Musician Barry spoke to Alison Hammond out his decades long career and what he has planned for the future. As he joined the This Morning presenter from his home in Palm Springs, Alison was also keen to hear how he stays looking so youthful. Alison began: “Barry Manilow is joining me now. Good morning to you.” “Good morning Alison. Good to meet you and good to see you,” Barry replied. The host continued: “It’s so good to see you. I think the last time we met was in Vegas all those years ago. “You sung to me with the piano, it was absolutely amazing. It’s so good to see you.  “I’ve got to say, firstly, you look incredible. What is the secret? You are not telling what the secret is.” “It’s luck, it’s just blind luck,” laughed Barry. “I’m really very old, please let’s not talk about it. It’s really depressing.” Alison giggled: “You look gorgeous honestly!” Those watching at home were also taken aback by Barry’s appearance on the show and commented on his “youthful” look.
