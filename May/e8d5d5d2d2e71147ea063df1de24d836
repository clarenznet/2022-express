Charles Leclerc managed to edge out Max Verstappen to put himself on pole position for tomorrow's Spanish Grand Prix at the end of qualifying. The Ferrari man set a time of 1:18.750 at the end of Q3 to guarantee the best possible starting berth at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, with Carlos Sainz in third and George Russell just behind in fourth place. Sergio Perez will start tomorrow's race in fifth position after producing a decent final lap, while Lewis Hamilton could only manage to put himself in sixth in spite of his best efforts. Valtteri Bottas managed to put his Alfa Romeo car in seventh place with a strong effort in Barcelona ahead of Kevin Magnussen, Daniel Ricciardo and Mick Schumacher in eighth, ninth and tenth respectively. Meanwhile, Mercedes will be delighted after following up their impressive showing in all three practice sessions by performing well over the course of today's qualifying runs. The Silver Arrows have brought a number of important upgrades to Barcelona and will be desperate to convert their qualifying efforts into a double-points finish at the very least when the five red lights go out to start tomorrow's 66-lap contest.
