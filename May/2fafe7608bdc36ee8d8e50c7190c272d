Only two weeks ago, on May 12, the city of Lima was shaken from an earthquake of 5.4 magnitude. Meanwhile, the American western coast was shaken again today by an earthquake with its epicentre in California. The California earthquake was of a 4.3 magnitude on the Richter scale and it was felt by thousands of people who wrote about it on social media.  Someone said: "Slow build, then strong jolt and softer longer shaking afterwards that lasted. Shook my bookcase, windows, doors. Didn’t hear it coming on." While another user wrote: "This woke me up. Gentle shaking back and forth and a dull noise? Not sure how to describe it but not as loud sounding as others have been. Just hope a bigger one isn't on its way."
