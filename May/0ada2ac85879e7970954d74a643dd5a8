BA is making several changes to its top team as it struggles to cope with shortages following the pandemic. The chief information and digital officer will be replaced, according to the Financial Times. An airline spokesperson said: “We’re navigating an extremely challenging period as we rebuild following the global pandemic, and therefore we’ve created four new roles on our leadership team. “Everyone at British Airways is completely focused on three priorities: our customers, supporting the biggest recruitment drive in our history and increasing our operational resilience to deliver the best possible experience for our customers.” British airlines and airports have had issues dealing with staff shortages as the peak holiday period begins.

Britons are advised to leave plenty of time to travel to the airport as they are not entitled to a refund if they miss their flight due to lengthy queues. If they are stuck in a queue, they could try calling the airline to see if the plane can be held or contacting a member of airport staff.
