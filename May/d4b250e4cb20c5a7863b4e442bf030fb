Borussia Dortmund may have lost Erling Haaland to Manchester City, but it seems they're intent on getting the last laugh in the summer transfer market by stealing one of their highly-rated wonderkids. Not for the first time, Dortmund have stolen an unhappy teenager from City by signing Jayden Braaf on a free. Braaf has been expected to leave City this summer for some time now having grown unhappy with his lack of playing time. The Dutch winger has never featured for the senior side despite impressing in the youth ranks. He's been in the midst of a contract stand-off with Etihad officials over a new deal, but it's been reported since the turn of the year that he would reject a new deal and leave on a free instead. Now, it's been confirmed he will join Dortmund in the summer when his contract in Manchester expires. His move will see him follow in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, who also left City for Dortmund after failing to break through. Sancho famously made a name for himself at the Signal Iduna Park after joining for just £8million. Four years later, he signed for Manchester United in a £73m deal after twice being named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season. Braaf had announced his departure from the Etihad on Thursday, confirming he would leave at the end of his current contract. In an emotional Instagram post, the 19-year-old thanked City's academy coaches for helping him recover from his serious knee injury. He wrote: “I want to say a huge thank you to everyone at Man City for the faith and support they’ve shown in me over the last few years. I’ve grown both personally and professionally and wouldn’t be where I am today without their guidance. "To my teammates, the academy staff and the fans, thank you! A big SO to Nick Oakley for working with me on my rehab and bringing me in the position I’m in now. All the best for the future.”
