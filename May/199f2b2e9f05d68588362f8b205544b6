Meteorologist Marco Petagna said the weather could get “very warm” later this month, peaking at around 23C in the south of England.  He said: “Temperatures are several degrees above where they should be at this time of year.” He added there was a “small chance” that temperatures could rise into the mid-twenties, meaning a “brief” heatwave. The UK's hottest day so far this year was Good Friday, when 23.4C (74F) was recorded in St James's Park in central London.

Friday will be warmer still in the southeast. Jo Farrow, a meteorologist with Netweather.tv, said: “For many today the temperatures will be in the mid-teens but in some of the brighter, sunnier spots temperatures could reach 17C to 19C. “As the warmth of the day gets going the convection builds, for SE Scotland and NE England late morning.
