According to the National Lottery, one lucky winner has bagged last night's EuroMillions jackpot. The winning ticket was bought by someone in the UK, making them the UK's biggest ever National Lottery winner, Camelot has said. Tuesday's winning EuroMillions numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 - plus the Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. And one ticket matched all seven numbers to win £184,262,899.10. This staggering prize makes the winner worth more than top footballers Harry Kane who has a net worth of £33 million and Paul Pogba at £64 million combined. The lucky UK ticket holder will now find themselves at the top of the National Lottery's rich list.

It is possible the winner will remain anonymous, as with many of the lottery's big winners. Anyone who suspects they have won the jackpot should get in touch with Camelot to confirm their win. Express.co.uk will update this page if any information is released. The National Lottery advised: "All draw game prizes must be claimed within 180 days after the draw." How you claim your prize also depends on how you bought your ticket, whether it was a physical ticket or bought online. You can learn more about claiming prizes via the National Lottery's website here. Only 14 players have ever won a jackpot of more than £100 million, with the previous record-holder an anonymous winner of £170 million in October 2019. Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at The National Lottery, said, "What an amazing night for one UK ticket-holder who has scooped the incredible £184 million EuroMillions jackpot - they have become the UK's biggest ever National Lottery winner. "Players are urged to check their tickets and give us a call if they think they are tonight's lucky winner." The previous biggest UK winner remained anonymous, and bagged £170,221,000 in October 2019, after matching all the numbers in a Must Be Won draw. Next was Colin and Chris Weir who won £161,653,000 in July 2011. The couple hailed from Largs, North Ayrshire, and set up the Weir Charitable Trust in 2013 as well as donating £1 million to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. They divorced in the same year as Colin's death. The next EuroMillions draw will start over at its base amount of £14million and will take place on Friday, May 13. For those wanting to take their luck, the next game will be the Lotto or Thunderball - both held on Wednesday. Thursday will see the Set For Life game played - giving one person the chance to take home £10,000 a month for 30 years.
