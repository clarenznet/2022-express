Amal Clooney, 44, wowed in a red gown as she attended the eighteenth Prince's Trust Awards at the Theatre Royal in London. She elegantly walked the red carpet ahead of the ceremony despite being caught in the rain. George Clooney’s wife stepped out in a sleeveless tube dress that featured a red floral print of red flowers. She paired the floor-length gown with white stilettos and accentuated her features with bold makeup which included a deep red lip. The brunette beauty styled her long locks in waves and a classic side parting. Amal is a British-Lebanese barrister specialising in International and Human Rights law. She married actor George Clooney in 2014 in Venice after the couple got engaged the same year.
