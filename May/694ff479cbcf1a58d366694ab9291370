Local elections in Scotland will give Nicola Sturgeon and her SNP candidates a chance to judge national favour for independence from the UK. The First Minister has proposed that her Government hold the long-awaited referendum by 2023, nine years after the last vote in 2014. But while the SNP holds a majority in Holyrood, polling shows that support for splitting from the UK is diminishing.  Recent polling conducted by The Economist found that only one in three Scots want another referendum. Despite this, Ms Sturgeon is confident that the SNP would find victory in a 2023 independence vote. Support for independence is now at around 56 percent, and the First Minister recently told the BBC she was "convinced" Scots would vote in favour of leaving the UK by 2023.
