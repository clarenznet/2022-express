Thomas Markle is currently believed to be in a hospital in California after suffering a stroke. Tom Bower, a journalist who is currently working on a biography of the Duchess said that Meghan has not made contact with her father but that since she has claimed to be a compassionate person, she should go and visit him. He said: "Meghan has always said that she's a very compassionate person. "And if compassion was at all necessary right now, it would mean she would go to her father's bedside, about two and a half hours' drive south of where she lives, and give him some comfort and reassurance. We wait to see what happens." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
