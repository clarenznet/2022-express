Jane Seymour, 71, looked younger than ever as she attended the 2022 Open Hearts Foundation Celebratory Gala. The glamorous event was held at her Malibu home last night and saw her wear a jaw-dropping floor-length gown in red and hot pink. The legendary Bond girl chose to wear her long straight hair down as she showcased her age-defying smooth complexion in natural looking makeup. Jane recently shut down rumours she had undergone a cosmetic procedure to lift up and pull back the skin to make her face tighter and smoother. Speaking last month on Steph's Packed Lunch, Jane highlighted that she has not had a facelift, but was not against people getting the procedure. She said: “I don't have anything against anyone doing plastic surgery, I've never said that I haven't done anything. “I think I was probably asked, 'have you done a facelift?' And I said, 'no, I haven't'. That doesn't mean I don't think anyone else shouldn’t.”
