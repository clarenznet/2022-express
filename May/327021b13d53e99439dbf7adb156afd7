Amandine Petit, 24, looked amazing as she took to the red carpet in a see-through duck egg blue dress. The dress' ruffled detailing parted at the front, exposing the model's toned pins. However, the Miss France title holder suffered a wardrobe malfunction as the gown's daring split was blown in the wind, exposing the model's nude knickers. The top of the dress featured a mesh corset style fit, further highlighting Amandine's envious figure. Amandine's dress met on one shoulder, bringing elegance to her look. She styled the gown with a silver headpiece, and silver stiletto heels, as well as silver stud earrings and rings. To avoid taking attention away from her outfit choice, Amandine wore her hair slicked back in a tight bun. Amandine currently holds the title for Miss France, having won in 2021, after previously being crowned Miss Normandy in 2020. She represented France at Miss Universe 2020, where she placed in the Top 21.
