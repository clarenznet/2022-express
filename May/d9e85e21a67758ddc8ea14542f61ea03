The 56-year-old flaunted her age-defying looks to over 2.3 million followers in a series of snaps featuring her in a dazzling tiara behind the scenes of the show. "The Royals has dropped on @netflix All four seasons," she wrote in celebration.  "Such happy memories of making such a fun, silly show about a fictitious British Royal Family!" The actress treated her followers to footage of herself on-set in nothing more than smoky eyeliner and a sheer white lace embroidered dress. While camera equipment could be seen in the background, Liz posed for her own more personal and intimate pictures behind the scenes. Other snaps include a pouting Liz beside Joan Collins, while wearing a glittering silver dress.  Despite looking sensational in the lace dress - and, in another snap, a black thong lingerie set - Liz has previously admitted she has no interest in extreme diets. Other photos she uploaded to her post included one of herself on-set with her 19-year-old son Damian, who had a cameo role in the show. Meanwhile in another, she donned a waist-hugging strapless black dress, paired with sexy fishnet tights, proving that the fictional Queen Helena is sizzling when not at the throne. The snaps give a preview of what kind of visuals fans can expect when they tune into the Netflix show. "Gorgeous minx!" @gigilevangie exclaimed, while @ann_caruso begged: "More seasons, please!"
