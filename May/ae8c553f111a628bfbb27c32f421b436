   Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman gave an insight into one peculiar bedtime habit that she's not particularly proud of in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. The star admitted that the “disgusting” practice would sometimes leave her bedding looking like she’d had a “nasty accident”.    Claudia, 50, opened up about her bedtime routine as she explained that she sometimes “has to apologise” to other members of her household. The presenter revealed that she chooses not to take her makeup off before bed, leaving it until the morning instead. “I've never ever taken it off before bed,” she insisted. “I take it off the next morning with my nifty Boots No7 gel which comes in a tube. Fantastic - don’t have to deal with pot opening. READ MORE: Coleen Rooney is 'different mother and wife' after her famous tweet       “But no, I sleep in it. I have more fun in my dreams,” Claudia added. When queried on whether she found that leaving her makeup on causes marks on the sheets, she replied: “Yes, it’s disgusting.” “With the eyeliner and the spray tan it looks like I've had quite a nasty accident. “You just have to apologise. I just wash it a lot,” she said, in reference to her pillow cases.     Claudia lives with her husband Kris, whom she married in 2000, and the pair are generally quite private about their home life.
