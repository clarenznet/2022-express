Julianne Moore, 61, took over the red carpet as she stunned in a classic satin gown at Cannes. Her black satin gown looked sensational with its low neckline and drop waist. The actress's plunging neckline showed off her ample assets as she posed for the cameras. Her youthful glow was on show as the strapless gown left her toned arms on show. She styled the outfit with a large silver emerald necklace and a matching ring. Julianne also went for a smokey eye and a natural lip, not distracting attention away from her dress. She styled her signature ginger locks in a straight do behind her ears, leaving her hair to fall down her back. After Cannes was entirely cancelled in 2020 and held under strict health protocols in 2021, the red carpet returned in all its glamour on Tuesday night. One of the first stars to walk the red carpet was Forest Whitaker - the Oscar-winning star of The Last King of Scotland - who picked up the honorary Palme d'Or award at the opening ceremony.
