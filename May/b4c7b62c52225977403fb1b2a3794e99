Queen Elizabeth looked stunning in a yellow outfit with a sparkly gold brooch this morning. The jewel was worth thousands of pounds. The monarch, 96, is wearing a yellow coat with a gold brooch, reportedly worth £5,200. The brooch is the Singapore Peranakan Diamond Jubilee Brooch. The piece is filigree work made of 18k gold and is in the Bird Of Paradise design. According to experts the design, worth £5,200, sold out after the piece was given to the Queen. The piece, which is made of gold, is large and round and features over 60 diamonds, was a gift from President of Singapore. Given to the Queen in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee, it has an interesting history. The Peranakan Chinese people are descended from immigrants to the Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. This style of jewellery is synonymous with Peranakan Chinese people.  The Queen paired her yellow coat with a matching hat that featured yellow and blue flowers. She also accessorised with simple pearl earrings and a three-strand pearl necklace. To keep her hands nice and warm, the monarch wore a pair of cream gloves. She held her walking stick firmly in her hand, which was actually the late Prince Philip's stalking stick.  Queen Elizabeth carried a simple leather black handbag to complete the outfit. She paired these with matching black leather loafers. Queen Elizabeth arrived at Paddington station in London with her youngest son, Prince Edward, to mark the completion of London's Crossrail project. Royal fans took to social media to praise the monarch's style.  Twitter user @RoyalTravel said: "She looks good. And great to see her out for an official outing."
