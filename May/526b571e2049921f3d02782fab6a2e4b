Five of the breaches involving "intoxicated persons" in March were referred to the serjeant-at-arms. Justice Minister Victoria Atkins said: "This is not how people should be conducting themselves in the workplace." Commons passes are said to have been suspended for some of the parliamentary staff involved in the recent incidents. Ms Atkins added: "The House of Commons is not a place where we turn up completely drunk and out of control." A House of Commons spokesman said: "Those who choose to drink in parliament must do so responsibly."
