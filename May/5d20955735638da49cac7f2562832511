Coleen Rooney's barrister, David Sherborne, probed Ms Vardy on the now-famous interview during the first day of the Wagatha Christie libel trial.Mr Sherborne read the headline: "Peter's hung like a small chipolata, shaved, slobbery, lasts five minutes".He then read excerpts from the article, in which it was claimed Mr Andre had managed "just five minutes of sex with Rebekah" and quoted her as saying he had "the smallest trouser equipment I've ever seen" that was like a "miniature chipolata".Mr Sherborne suggested to Ms Vardy that the News Of The World was the "highest circulating newspaper at the time", read by around four million people.

It is something that I deeply regret... It is not nice to read, and I understand why this is being used and to me this is mudslinging, and I was also threatened with mudslinging by Ms Rooney's team."Asked the question again, Ms Vardy said: "The circumstances around it were completely different,” and repeated that it was something she was “forced to say".Peter Andre has also spoken out after the interview was brought to light more than 15 years since it was first published. Via Instagram, the Mysterious Girl singer said he has taken "hit after hit" since she made the chipolata jibe and claimed there would be "absolute outrage" had the tables been turned.The father-of-four said: "If a man had said this about her anatomy and made up something, you can use your imagination, saying something very unflattering, there would be absolute outrage."But because it has been said about me it's been the butt of all jokes. I've taken it for 15 years."Peter also apologised to his wife Emily and his children, who have "had to see and hear some not very nice things".He added: "It's brought up again, the only one that sits there and takes hit after hit about it is me. I've been laughing about it for a while but think about how it would feel if it was the other way round, and that's all I'm saying.”
