The £300,000 monument was installed yesterday without ceremony in her home town of Grantham, Lincs, on a 10ft-high plinth under CCTV surveillance. The statue towers over St Peter's Hill Green, close to the site of the grocer shop owned by the ex-prime minister's family. A temporary fence was put up to protect the memorial but within two hours eggs had been thrown at it. Video on social media showed a man in a white T-shirt approach with a box. His first two eggs missed but the protester struck with the third and the remains were still visible yesterday afternoon. Lincolnshire Police said: "We received reports of criminal damage to the Margaret Thatcher statue shortly after 10am on Sunday. "No arrests have been made. Inquiries are ongoing." The memorial was offered to South Kesteven District Council after Westminster Council rejected it over fears of "civil disobedience and vandalism". A planned £100,000 unveiling ceremony was heavily criticised in 2020, while more than 13,000 people expressed interest in a proposed "egg-throwing contest" on Facebook. The UK's first female PM, dubbed the Iron Lady, was born in Grantham in 1925 and died in 2013 aged 87. The only previous memorial in Baroness Thatcher's home town was a plaque for her birthplace.
