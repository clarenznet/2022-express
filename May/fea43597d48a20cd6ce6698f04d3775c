Mistrust has risen faster among females. More than a quarter had little faith in the force - an almost 10 percent rise in the past year, a poll found. The OnePoll for ITV's Good Morning Britain also revealed a growing number of 14 to 24-yearolds believe the police are racist. Women's confidence in police has been seriously hit by a series of tragedies and scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard by serving PC Wayne Couzens in March 2021. The jailing of two police officers for taking and sharing photographs of murder victims Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman was another blow to the force's reputation.  Interviews with 1,000 teenagers and young adults revealed nearly a third say their trust in the forces of law and order has diminished. Nearly half of those said Scotland Yard's handling of the Partygate probe into illegal Downing Street booze-ups had harmed confidence. And just under half of young people polled said concerns over policing of climate change protests had lowered their faith in police. Almost half told pollsters the force is "institutionally racist" - a 10 percent rise in a year.
