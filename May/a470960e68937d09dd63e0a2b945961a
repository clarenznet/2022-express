A poll found 28 per cent of people had witnessed more clashes out and about in the last year. But the survey uncovered a conflict between what those quizzed see on the streets - and their desire for speedy deliveries themselves. More than four in 10 blamed the rise in road rage on the sheer numbers of cycle couriers. Six in 10 said they had noticed more delivery riders. Yet 45 per cent felt that customers "needing it now" fuelled the chaos g outside. A third admitted they would only wait 45 minutes for food themselves before getting ratty. Other reasons given for annoyance at cyclists included riding on pavements, a lack of respect for others and jumping red lights - all cited by more than a quarter of people. Rapid delivery firm Jiffy set up the poll of 2,000. It has teamed up with Olympic cycle champ Ed Clancy for next month's National Bike Week to teach two-wheeled couriers how to deliver swiftly and safely. Ed said: "We're making this film publicly available to [help] improve safety."
