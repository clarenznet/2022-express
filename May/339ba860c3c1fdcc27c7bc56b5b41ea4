The Queen has limited the appearance on Buckingham Palace's balcony during Trooping the Colour on Thursday to working royals only, meaning the Sussexes, who are travelling to Britain from California for the celebrations, will miss out along with Prince Andrew. A former royal aide described the symbolic move as "significant" and shows "who is important" in the Firm. They told the i newspaper: “The symbolism is significant because it is emphasising that continuity and the future lie firstly with the Prince of Wales but in particular with the Cambridges. "The balcony appearance is a very public way of showing who is important.” The monarch's decision to only include royals carrying out official public duties was taken "after careful consideration", Buckingham Palace previously said.
