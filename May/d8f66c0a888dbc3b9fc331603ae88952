Madonna, 63, has reunited with Maluma, 28, for a new collaboration ahead of her surprise appearance on stage at the Colombian singer’s concert last night. The Material Girl singer took to Instagram earlier today to share an insight into her trip to Medellin, where she met her co-star. She uploaded a video containing short clips of the pair’s rehearsal together, alongside other dancers. The teaser included a racy clip showing Madonna straddling Maluma as he lay on the floor. The pop star captioned the video: “Medellin……….. !!!!!! TE AMO,” as she declared her love for the city. For the occasion, Madonna wore a short sleeve mesh T-shirt and skimpy wide legged shorts with colourful floral embroidery. She finished off the look with sunglasses and a cowboy hat, worn over her braided hair.
