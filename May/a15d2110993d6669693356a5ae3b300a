Emma Raducanu has somewhat surprisingly revealed that she regularly 'forgets' that she won the US Open last year. The 19-year-old Brit stunned the tennis world by triumphing at Flushing Meadows without dropping a set, becoming a household name almost overnight in the process. Yet she has struggled for form and with injuries since then, and crashed out of the French Open in the second round earlier this week with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 defeat to Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich. Raducanu's attentions will soon turn to grass, and she is guaranteed a hero's welcome when she takes to the court in a homecoming at Wimbledon next month. It has certainly been a whirlwind few months for the teenager, and speaking to the Telegraph Raducanu admitted she would have done a few things differently if she had her time again. "I didn’t really give myself that space," she admits when asked about how she dealt with the attention after the US Open. "I was just straight into the next thing, and I completely forgot I won. I was just so focused, which is the way it should be, but if you go straight into it too soon, you lose that spark you had. "A lot of the time I forget [about being a Grand Slam champion], and that’s one thing I think I should do more – wake up and be proud of my achievements, and of myself, rather than giving myself a hard time about other things. "I wake up knowing, look, I started playing tennis as a kid wanting to win a Grand Slam, that’s what I set out [to do], but of course I would want more, and it’s tough to not be absorbed in the results and to really enjoy what you’re doing." Raducanu has certainly not hit the heights hoped of her since her victory in the States. And her mood won't be helped by Sasnovich admitting she found her match against the Bromley-born star 'easy'. Post-match she said per Sportskeeda: “Honestly, I had Covid a few months ago. So I didn't prepare well for the crazy season, I didn't expect things to go easy, but yeah, I'm happy."
