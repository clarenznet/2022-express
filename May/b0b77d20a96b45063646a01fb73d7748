Dan Evans and Alex Stubbs popped out for a pint last Friday afternoon but, at a bar, made the impromptu decision to get a taxi to the airport and head abroad. They found a flight to Majorca was fully booked, so bought tickets for a trip to Ibiza instead despite having no hotel. And, after "partying the whole weekend", they managed to get a flight to London and then travel the 170 miles home to Aberdare, south Wales. They shared photos of their adventure online but have been slammed on social media. "How crazy," wrote one man on Facebook. "They are muppets," reads another comment. "The things people do for attention," a third person stated. Others were suspicious of the lads' accounts, Wales Online reports. But Dan, 23, said: "We stopped off at home (after the drink near Aberdare) to collect our passports and phone chargers, and then headed to the airport. "When we got there though the Majorca flight was fully booked, but there was a flight to Ibiza, so we booked ourselves on to that one. "We literally partied the whole weekend, and then when the sun came up on Sunday morning we had to think about how we were going to get home." Dan and Alex had only bought a one-way tickets from Cardiff, and the only one back on Sunday was to London Stansted.  Dan added: "It was more difficult getting a plan back, but we sorted one, flew back into London in plenty of time to be at work on Monday. "It was a bit of a shock to the system, but it was all worth it. "We have no regrets and will probably do it again, but it might be a few years before we can do it again."
