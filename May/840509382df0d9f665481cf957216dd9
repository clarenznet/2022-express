Penny Lancaster, 51, stunned as she took the red carpet today ahead of the 18th Prince's Trust Awards. The star-studded event is taking place at the Theatre Royal in London’s Covent Garden. It saw Penny attend in a flowy black and white midi dress with a polka dot pattern. She paired the button-down gown with a micro black handbag and red heels. Penny threw her long, blonde tresses into a messy bun and wore natural-looking makeup for the daytime event. She has been a panellist on lunchtime ITV chat show Loose Women since 2014. The blonde beauty has been married to rock singer Sir Rod Stewart since 2007.
