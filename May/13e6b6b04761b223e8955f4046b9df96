Tom Hanks, 65, has put his new, slimmer frame on display today at the UK special screening of the Elvis biopic at BFI Southbank in London. The Forrest Gump star looked fantastic in a suit as he walked the red carpet. Tom could be seen posing alongside Austin Butler, 30, the actor who plays the rock legend in the film. The actor was cast in the role of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's longtime manager. He also posed for pictures alongside the movie director Baz Luhrmann, who wore an all-black ensemble adorned with a belt that featured the word “Elvis” on the buckle. Olivia DeJonge, 24, who plays Elvis’s wife Priscilla, dazzled on the red carpet in a nude floor-length satin gown. The new film will be released in cinemas in the UK on June 24.
