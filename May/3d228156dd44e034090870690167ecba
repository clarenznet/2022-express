Meghan and Harry signed a multi-million-pound deal with Netflix two years ago and are said to have welcomed cameras into their home in Montecito, California, to capture content for their upcoming series. It is not yet known what the documentary will include but the couple were also filmed by Netflix on their trip to New York last September.  Page Six quotes a Hollywood insider saying that the streaming service will finally get its “pound of flesh” from Meghan and Harry. Netflix would allegedly like the series available to stream by the end of the year to tie in with Harry’s upcoming memoir. But sources suggest that Meghan and Harry would rather it was held until next year. One producer told Page Six: “The timing is still being discussed, things are up in the air.” News of the docuseries could cause concern for Buckingham Palace over allegations that may be included in the show.  MailOnline reports that it is unclear if the couple’s children – Archie, three, and Lilibet, 11 months – have been filmed by Netflix. Meghan and Harry signed a deal with Netflix in 2020, reportedly worth £77million, but are yet to share any content through the streaming service. Netflix announced earlier this month that they had cancelled the development of Meghan’s animated children’s series.  Meghan was an executive producer of Pearl which was due to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. The Sussexes were followed by Netflix to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games last month for a docuseries titled Heart of Invictus, due to be released later this year or in early 2023. It is expected to follow the journey of competitors at the Invictus Games, a sporting event founded by Harry for military veterans in 2014. So what do YOU think?
