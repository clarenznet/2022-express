A palace insider has warned that “tensions could explode” if the estranged couple try to film for their £112 million TV series during Royal events. While the pair have been banned from appearing on the balcony for the Trooping of the Colour, it is not yet known which parts of the celebration they will be attending. A “well-placed” source speaking to the Sun said: “While the family are delighted Harry and Meghan are coming, there is a real fear of tension, especially over any Netflix crew. There are concerns tension could explode if the Netflix team comes to the UK and tries to exploit their opportunities. “The worry is they will push it and try to gain access to areas of Jubilee celebration events where they can film Harry and Meghan and their children. “Even if they accept that their Netflix crew can’t go into Buckingham Palace to film, they could cause problems – and at the very least cause a major distraction. “Senior courtiers believe that Netflix will see it as one big opportunity to exploit their mega-millions agreement with the couple. “So a team of Palace aides will be on standby to keep a very close eye on the crew, and act as minders if needs be.”  FOLLOW FOR MORE LIVE UPDATES..
