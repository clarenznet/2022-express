The cancelled flights were due to operate from BA’s hub Heathrow. British Airways said all the passengers were given advance notice.

If the cancellation was announced less than two weeks in advance, a passenger is due cash compensation. easyJet has also cancelled about 30 flights from its main UK hub, Gatwick but said most passengers were able to switch flights. The budget airline is planning to remove one row of seating to ease cabin crew requirements during the staffing issues. Ditching a row of seating will mean easyJet planes can fly with three cabin crew rather than four. Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO of the Advantage Travel Partnership, told Express.co.uk: “easyJet resorting to stripping out seats prevents them from having to cancel flights and keeps their capacity for this summer close to 2019 levels avoiding unnecessary flight cancellations helping consumers and travel agents manage demand for overseas travel.” The planes will now carry 150 passengers which will allow them to use just three cabin crew. Staffing issues have plagued the aviation industry in recent weeks with passengers at Birmingham and Manchester airports also facing huge queues.  During the pandemic, many travel staff were made redundant and may have since found other work. Aviation employees also have to pass a high level of security clearance which can slow recruitment. British tourists are advised to travel to the airport at least two hours before their flight to pass security. If passengers miss their flight due to long security queues they are not automatically entitled to compensation.
