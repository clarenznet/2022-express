Officers said they've particularly targeted M25 and M11 near and around London following requests from motorists to finally crackdown on drivers who hog the middle lane. These motorists, police say, often don't realise the dangers they cause by staying in the centre of the motorway at a relatively slow speed. Some drivers who have been caught on these motorways recently have been ordered to go on educational courses, rather than take points on their licences. The action has been praised on social media, Essex Live reports. Essex Road Policing tweeted: "We patrol our roads 24/7, including the #M11 and #M25 where we often deal with 'middle lane hoggers' as requested by you. "Some are a quick flash or use of our message board, others like this chap are ref'd to an educational course in lieu of points." Middle lane hogging is classed as a traffic offence under "careless driving" legislation. Speaking last year, RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams said middle lane hogging "needlessly causes congestion". In response to Essex Police's vow, one woman posted on Facebook: "About flaming time! People need to remember the middle Lane is for overtaking - once you have overtaken move back over to the inside lane." Another Facebook user stated: "It's about time. This driving is just lazy." A third wrote: "The frustration caused by these selfish inconsiderate lane hoggers are the route cause of many accidents."
