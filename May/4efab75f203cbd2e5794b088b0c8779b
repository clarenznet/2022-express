There have been reports the Duchess of Sussex would like to make a pitch for the White House and her political ambitions have been supported in the Democracy Institute/ Express.co.uk monthly US tracker poll published today. Asked which female candidate they want, respondents put Markle second behind Michelle Obama but ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris and Hilary Clinton. The survey findings have underlined the dismal political situation faced by President Joe Biden and the Democrats while showing the way is clear for Donald Trump to win back the White House. Looking ahead to November’s midterm elections, the Republicans are ahead by 50 percent to the Democrats’ 42 percent. This would give the Republicans 262 seats in the House of Representatives to 173 Democrats while in the Senate it is projected to be 54 to 46 in favour of the Republicans. This will open up the prospect of the Republicans pushing ahead with attempts to impeach President Biden over alleged corruption involving his son Hunter and historic deals in Ukraine. But things get worse for President Biden as for the second month in a row more Americans (53 percent) believe it would be better if he is out of the White House than those who think it would be better if Putin was deposed in the Kremlin (44 percent). The US President has negative ratings on every front and only 35 percent think he can win the next election if he runs again while 63 percent believe he will lose. Patrick Basham, Director of the Democracy Institute, said: “Americans were initially quite supportive of the sanctions that the Biden administration promised would collapse the Russian economy. But domestic supply chain problems and rising prices, when contrasted with full shelves in Moscow and a ruble gaining in strength against the American dollar, mean the unceasing drumbeat about Russia’s ruined economy rings rather hollow. “Crucially, voters increasingly appreciate that the tit-for-tat sanctions dance ongoing between Russia and most Western nations is harming them here at home more than their intended target, the Russian people.” READ MORE: Omid Scobie forced to delete tweet mocking Andrew, Beatrice & Eugenie With Donald Trump continuing to give major rallies across America and Twitter coming under the ownership of Elon Musk ensuring free speech on the social media platform, there is a belief Mr Trump can win again. The polling shows that President Biden still stands the best chance against Trump than any other Democrat but still losing by 47 percent to 43 percent. Hilary Clinton comes six points behind Trump on 47 percent to 41 percent in a head to head. However, the next best performer against Trump is the Duchess of Sussex who polls seven points behind 46 percent to 39 percent.

And in a prickly relationship he once said “Harry will need a lot of luck” in a dig at the American ex-Royal and adding “I don’t like her.” In a head-to-head between the two there is an enormous 15 percent undecided bigger than any other match up and more than double the gap between them offering the Duchess a path to victory as an unknown political commodity. There is a strong suggestion that the Democrats will replace Biden as their candidate for 2024 with a woman. The clear favourite for that is former US President Barack Obama’s wife Michelle on 39 percent. However, in second place is Meghan at 17 percent. She comes ahead of more established political figures like Vice President Kamala Harris (11 percent) and Hilary Clinton (13 percent).

The national party identification turnout model is D (+) 2, i.e., Democrats = 35 percent; Republicans = 33 percent; and Independents = 32 percent. The survey was conducted via interactive voice response, in which recorded questions were played for randomly-dialled respondents and answers were given via their telephone keypads. To ensure a representative sample, the results were weighted for key demographic and political variables including, but not limited to, party identification, gender, age, education, income, region, voting history, and cell phone-only households. This national poll has a margin of error of (+/-) 3 percent at a 95 percent confidence interval.
