On Tuesday, Kate, 40, embarked on her first solo overseas tour in five years, by visiting Copenhagen, Denmark to learn more about the country’s approach to early childhood development. While she was away, the Duke of Cambridge had been left in the UK to be a solo parent to their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. In an unearthed interview, Prince William, 39, opened up on some of the challenges he’s faced when it comes to parenthood. The Mirror reported the Duke revealed: "The alteration from being a single, independent man to going into marriage and then having children is life-changing. George is a right little rascal sometimes, he keeps me on my toes, but he's a sweet boy." According to People, while on a royal trip to Blackpool to meet a parenting group named Dads 4 Life in 2019, the Prince also revealed he struggles with a more daunting parenting task when it came to his only daughter. William said “Never try to do a ponytail!", before adding "Nightmare." The father-of-three added he could actually do a ponytail but joked he had very little practice, saying: “I can do [Princess Charlotte’s] ponytail, but that’s about it as I don’t have enough hair to practice on!” It comes amid news the Duchess of Cambridge’s next trip abroad will see her visit Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas alongside her husband in March, as part of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee schedule.
