Former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was at loggerheads with US President John F Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis. It was the closest the nations came to a nuclear war during 13 days in October 1962. Khrushchev famously said: “The two most powerful nations had been squared off against each other, each with its finger on the button.” It followed the failed US attempt to overthrow Cuba’s Communist regime in the Bay of Pigs invasion. Khrushchev secretly agreed with leader Fidel Castro to place Soviet missiles on the island. Kennedy ordered a naval blockade and in a chilling address warned: “It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any missile launched from Cuba against any nation inthe Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full response.” As the threat of war increased, the leaders struck a deal. Khrushchev removed the arms in exchange for a US pledge not to invade. Kennedy also secretly agreed to remove missiles from Turkey.
