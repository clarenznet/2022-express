The Europa League draw for the round of 16 has been completed and a series of tantalising match-ups have been made. Rangers, following their historic two-legged victory over Borussia Dortmund, have emerged as one of the favourites to go all the way this season but must overcome an arduous two-legged duel against Red Star Belgrade. the Scottish titans were not seeded heading into the last 16 of the competition, just like Spanish royalty Barcelona. David Moyes' West Ham United were the only seeded British side remaining in the Europa League after topping their group, and joined the likes of Red Star Belgrade, Eintracht Frankfurt, Galatasaray, Bayer Leverkusen, Lyon, Monaco and Spartak Moscow. The Hammers are hopeful of pulling off something special this season, but took a dent to the confidence after being drawn out of the hat against Sevilla - the competition's most successful side. Football royalty Barcelona find themselves in unfamiliar territory in the Europa League this season, but are still very much determined to bring the silverware back to Catalonia. Xavi's side have been paired against Galatasaray, in a fixture which is poised to conjure quite a remarkable atmosphere over two legs. Another eye-catching fixture sees two European heavyweights, FC Porto and Lyon, do battle. In terms of scheduling, the first legs of the last-16 ties will be played on March 10, with the return fixtures a week later on March 17. The final itself will take place in Seville on May 18.
