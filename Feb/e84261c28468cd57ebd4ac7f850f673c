As more youngsters become eligible for second jabs, 5,136 schools will be visited in the drive to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds. An NHS half-term push resulted in 106,610 pupils receiving their second dose and 28,090 their first, during the past fortnight. So far, almost 750,000 young people have been double jabbed - three in five of those eligible. Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: "It is brilliant that local teams will be visiting over 650 more schools, making it easier than ever for pupils to get their second dose as they become eligible."
