Xbox Game Pass enjoyed an incredible year in 2021, and Microsoft are set to follow it-up with another jam-packed schedule. While Microsoft has not revealed every game heading to Xbox Game Pass in 2022, subscribers already know about dozens of games that will be heading to XGP in the next twelve months. Among the confirmed releases are high-profile titles such as STALKER 2, Starfield and Redfall. But besides these first-party Microsoft releases, Xbox Game Pass will be getting plenty of eye-catching indie and third-party launches - such as Devolver Digital's gorgeous looking samurai game Trek to Yomi, stylish sci-fi platformer Replaced, Weird West (the new game from Arkane Studios co-founder Raphaël Colantonio), Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and much, much more. While it was also confirmed towards the start of the year that Rainbow Six Extraction - one of the biggest new games of 2022 - will be heading to Xbox Game Pass on Day One. Besides these releases, given 2022 has only just started surely Microsoft has other high-profile releases planned for this year that haven't been announced. There are tonnes of exciting games Microsoft has in the works for the Xbox Series X and S which don't have a release date, such as Hellblade 2, The Elder Scrolls 6, the new Fable game and Perfect Dark. This year may be a bit soon to see some of these titles, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see the new Forza Motorsport launch in 2022. While Rare's gorgeous looking Everwild, which first was revealed back in 2019, may also be in line for a 2022 release.
