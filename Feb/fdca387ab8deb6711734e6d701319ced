AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie is not tempted by the prospect of joining Arsenal ahead of Tottenham or Barcelona in the summer transfer window, according to reports. The 25-year-old will be a free agent at the end of the campaign as things stand and is not expected to sign a new deal at the San Siro over the coming months. Kessie has been locked in talks with Milan's hierarchy for some time but is yet to reach an agreement over an extension to his current contract with the Italian giants.He is set to leave the club on a free transfer as a result and there is said to be no shortage of interest in his services ahead of next season.The likes of Tottenham and Arsenal have been credited with a desire to land Kessie, who has made 26 appearances in all competitions for Milan since the beginning of the campaign.A number of other clubs have also been mentioned in connection with the midfielder's signature as of late, but it seems as though Barcelona could soon emerge as the main contenders to snap him up in the summer.A proposed move to the Nou Camp for Kessie is edging 'closer and closer' after he was left with doubts over the idea of joining Arsenal, according to Sport.

The playmaker joined Milan from Atalanta back in the summer of 2017, with the Serie A heavyweights paying a fee of around £21.6million to secure his services.He recently returned from international duty after playing in every match for Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year.Meanwhile, former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson recently suggested that Kessie would be the perfect signing for Tottenham and would thrive as a result of Antonio Conte's knowledge of the midfielder."Conte knows a lot about him from his time at Inter Milan," Robinson told Football Insider last month.
