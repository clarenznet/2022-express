Wordle is a fantastic game that has taken the world by storm. You have six attempts to guess a five letter word, using the process of elimination to figure out which letters go where. The only drawback, however, is that you're limited to one Wordle puzzle a day, leaving fans wanting more. If you want to scratch that Wordle itch, or maybe you want to go back to where it all began, you should check out the Wordle Archive fan-made website. Available through this link, the unofficial Wordle ArchiveÂ features every past Wordle puzzle from the very beginning. At the time of writing, that's nearly 250 Wordle puzzles to sink your teeth into. The website features a handy chart showing whether you've solved a particular puzzle, and how many guesses you made. There are also a handful of supplementary game modes, including Random Wordle, 6-letter Wordle, Word Race and Custom Word. The 6-letter Wordle is much tougher than the original puzzle, which is perfect if you need a challenge. In case you aren't entirely sure of the rules of Wordle, you'll need to guess the five-letter word within six attempts. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The site keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your current winning streak. If you really want a challenge, Wordle even has a hard mode, which can be turned on in the settings.
