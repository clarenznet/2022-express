Nick lived in the USA for two years with his wife after moving there for work. The British expat lived in New Jersey, just outside of New York. New Jersey was named after the beautiful island of Jersey in the English Channel and is a popular holiday destination. Music legends Bruce Springsteen, Frank Sinatra and Jon Bon Jovi were all born in New Jersey. Nick told Express.co.uk he loved living in the USA and has considered moving back to the States. However, there were a couple of things the expat found “very weird” and just couldn’t get used to.

The doors are really low level. “There are also always wide gaps between the stalls. Then the water level in the toilet is strangely high. “It’s very close to the seat and a well endowed man can end up getting showered!” A public American toilet or ‘restroom’ does have some significant differences to one in the UK. American toilets are normally filled with a very high water level which might surprise some British people. Toilet cubicles are also notoriously less private than those in the UK or other European countries. There’s often a small crack between the door and frame which some people say is wide enough to see through. As Nick said, the cubicles are also normally not very high, making public toilets in the US far less private than the UK. Nick added: “When it comes to holiday entitlement, workers in the US get far fewer days off than in the UK. “I think they get about eight national holidays plus another four days that they can take whenever. “But they get very little actual paid holiday. Sometimes it can be as little as a week in your first year. “If you compare that to Europe, say France or Italy, it’s really low. Even in the UK, we get so much more.”
