The brothers led defiant pledges from Ukrainians to resist Kremlin forces. Vitali, 50, who has been Kyiv's mayor since 2014, enlisted in his country's reserve army earlier this month. He said: "I believe in Ukraine, I believe in my country and I believe in my people." Meanwhile, Ukrainians in Britain are said to be planning to return to their homeland to fight. Wolodymyr Pawluk, of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said: "In London, I can only say a handful have said that they will go back. "There are many more that I've also heard will go."Around 18,000 guns have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region since the invasion began.  Marta Yuzkiv, a doctor and mother of three, said she also intended to fight Vladimir Putin's invaders. She said: "I won't allow them to take our land and our freedom.They don't believe in our right to exist.We have to defend, and we will win."
