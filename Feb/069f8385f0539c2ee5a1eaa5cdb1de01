Saturday Night Takeaway hosts Ant McPartlin, and Declan Donnelly are notoriously known for awarding people with life-changing amounts of money and prizes during their show. On Saturday night, during the 'Happiest Minute of the Week' segment, Ant and Dec gave away as many holidays as they could without the winners having a clue. However, one unsuspecting restaurant guest was seen looking less than impressed when his evening meal was interrupted by Jordan North awarding the owner with a holiday. Jordan North surprised a restaurant owner in Finchley, London, with a getaway in person and interrupted the people's insides meals. As Jordan ran through the restaurant with the camera crew to surprise the owner, a customer was seen tucking into his dinner but looked beyond confused at what was happening. Eagle-eyed fans of the show were quick to take to Twitter to discuss the unsuspecting man and his annoyed facial expression. @GeorgiaEH17 said: "This man was fuming about his food getting interrupted, the pure disgust! #SaturdayNightTakeaway."

Whilst Simon Hardwick tweeted: "If that bloke with the suspicious expression in the restaurant doesn’t become a meme, I may be forced to resign #SaturdayNightTakeaway." Throughout the episode, Ant and Dec give out a numerous amount of prizes but sometimes put on comedic sketches. The segment called "Polter Guys" saw Ant and Dec sit down for an Indian takeaway before being interrupted by "The Devil". Dec revealed to Ant that when the show first aired in 2002, he made a deal that he would sign his soul over to the devil in exchange for the show to be a success.

Some fans of the show were left annoyed at the segment as they felt it was inappropriate to be aired at the beginning of the show as children were still watching. Fuming on Twitter, @gail_maynes said: "#SaturdayNightTakeaway Polter Guys is a bit scary for younger kids. It's freaked my seven year old out. Such a shame, he loves this show." @Grumblehampton wrote: "This is totally inappropriate for children watching and is dabbling in the occult. #SaturdayNightTakeaway." Samantha Low also agreed: "Exorcist reference? Poor choice 2for a family-friendly show. Please rethink Polter Guys sketch and age of child viewers." (sic) As per tradition, Ant and Dec also played Win The Ads with an unsuspecting member of the audience. After winning five amazing prizes, the guest decided to play and gamble the ones he had already won for a chance to win all 16. Taking the gamble, the guest managed to guess the question correct and went home with an array of prizes, including a holiday for him and his wife. Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway airs Saturday at 7pm on ITV.
