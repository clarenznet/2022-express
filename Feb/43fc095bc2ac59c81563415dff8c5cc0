The RAC said the average price for a litre of petrol or diesel at forecourts across the UK on Tuesday was 149.30p or 152.68p respectively. It warned drivers to expect petrol prices to hit the "grim milestone" of 150p per litre in the coming days as retailers pass on rising wholesale costs. Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said: “Another day and another new record for both petrol and diesel prices. Petrol is sadly creeping ever closer to the shocking landmark of £1.50 a litre. “Oil topped $100 a barrel on Tuesday and is very likely to stay there due to the situation in Ukraine, coupled with production still not being able to catch up with growing global demand as we emerge from the pandemic. “With a tank of petrol now costing over £82 and diesel nearly £84, drivers will be wincing every time they go to fill up. And those on lower incomes who rely on their cars will be starting to suffer.” The price of Brent crude oil hit a seven-year high of 99 US dollars on Tuesday because of concerns over the reliability of supplies after Russian troops entered eastern Ukraine.
