In a television address, the Russian President called the West an “empire of lies” and called for the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of Ukraine while stating that “we do not intend to occupy Ukraine.” He said: “We can no longer simply observe what is happening NATO expanding into Ukraine is unacceptable for us. “A clash between Russia and these forces is inevitable. It is only a matter of time.” "To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history." A CNN reporter in central Kiev has said that there was a “big explosion taking place” while doing a live report. There are also reports of artillery shelling at border areas. Russia’s defence ministry has said that it is using high-precision weapons aimed to disable military targets and are not targeting civilians. Reports suggest that President Biden is conducting a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
