Harry Richardson, who used to work at Leek College in Staffordshire, moved to the country three years ago after marrying his Ukrainian wife,Alina. Following the first Russian attacks on Thursday, the couple and around 70 others sought refuge underground. In a YouTube video, the pair, who live in the Cherkasy region, around 100 miles from the capital, Kyiv, plead for western countries to do more to help. Harry says: "I'm talking to you because we desperately need your help. The situation in Ukraine is dire. People are dying. The world cannot turn away. Sanctions are not enough."  He said he hoped talks would bring the war to an end, adding: "But it's not going to happen because how can you talk to someone that won't listen?"
