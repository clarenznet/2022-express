On Thursday, Ukraine said Vladimir Putin had launched a “full-scale invasion”, following the Russian president announcing a “special military operation” in the east of the country. After his televised address, explosions were reported in the outskirts of the cities of Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, as well as the capital Kiev. Images from city Kharkiv showed what appeared to be the tail section of a rocket fired from a Smerch heavy multiple rocket launcher. The rocket’s payload failed to explode on impact and it was left sticking out of the pavement in the city close to an Orthodox church. CIT, an open-source research group, confirmed that the video was shot in Kharkiv and that the tali section resembled a Smerch MLRS rocket. The use of those rockets against population centres is a “war crime,” the group claims.
