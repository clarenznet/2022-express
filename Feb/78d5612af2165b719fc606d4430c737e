Lewis Hamilton left it late to register the quickest lap in a Mercedes one-two on the final day of pre-season testing in Barcelona. The 37-year-old topped the timesheets ahead of George Russell on Friday to cap off an intriguing three-day period in which all 10 teams put their brand-new 2022 cars through their paces ahead of the new campaign. Another three-day test will follow in Bahrain next month before the competitive action gets underway at the same circuit after a week's break.Friday's test was disrupted by no less than five red flags during the morning session, with a number of teams experiencing performance and reliability issues over the course of the day's running.Alpine, Haas, Aston Martin and AlphaTauri all failed to maximise their time at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya after they were left unable to register any lap times in the afternoon.Meanwhile, the likes of Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren enjoyed plenty of running and seemed to perform well over the duration of the tests in general.Express Sport takes a look at five talking points from this week's pre-season tests before hostilities are resumed once again when the new F1 season gets underway. JUST IN: Michael Masi ‘received death threats’ after Abu Dhabi GP Red Bull raised plenty of eyebrows when they arrived at the start of Wednesday's test with the radical sidepod design of their all-new RB18 challenger.The Austrian outfit's concept of a striking undercut with a narrow inlet was vastly different from any other team's interpretation of the new aerodynamic regulations.The unique sidepods on the RB18 were immediately hailed as a stroke of genius from Red Bull mastermind Adrian Newey, who has designed five Constructors' Championship-winning cars over the course of his career in F1.However, it remains to be seen whether the RB18 will break Mercedes' nine-year period of dominance when this year's order of superiority is decided at the end of the season. Mercedes are no strangers to the art of psychology and already look to be playing mind games with their rivals after just three days of pre-season running.Russell made a dubious claim on Thursday when he suggested that Ferrari and McLaren are currently ahead of the Silver Arrows in terms of on-track performance.He followed up on Friday with the assertion that plenty of work needs to be done by Mercedes to ensure their place at the front of the order in 2022.The German team are still the favourites to secure Constructors' Championship glory once again, though, and will surely be fighting at the right end of the pack when the new season finally gets underway next month. Ferrari were arguably the surprise package of this week's tests after impressing with their straight-line speed and reliability over the course of the three-day event.They became the first team to rack up a total of 400 laps of running on Friday and regularly featured near the top of the timesheets at the end of each session.There seems to be a feeling that Ferrari's eye-catching F1-75 challenger may be the real deal in the wake of their encouraging start to pre-season in Barcelona.The historic Italian team will be hoping to follow up with another productive week in Bahrain to fine-tune their preparations before the competitive action kicks off. Haas saw their participation in this week's testing event quickly overshadowed by the knock-on effects of Russia's recent incursion into Ukraine.The American-owned team are set to hold meetings over whether their lucrative sponsorship deal with Russian firm Uralkali will be cut short in the wake of recent developments.The company is part-owned by billionaire oligarch Dmitry Mazepin, the father of Haas driver Nikita, with the former's involvement in funding the latter's race seat plunging his future into doubt just weeks before the start of the new campaign.It seems as though Pietro Fittipaldi would be the main candidate to replace Mazepin if his seat is vacated over the coming days, while the need to find a new title sponsor in place of Uralkali would pose its own problems for Haas ahead of the upcoming season. FOLLOW OUR NEW DAILY EXPRESS SPORT INSTAGRAM PAGE A number of high-profile figures have complained about the phenomenon known as porpoising, which has returned to F1 with the re-introduction of ground effect after a 40-year absence, over the course of this week.It results in cars bouncing up and down at the end of the long straights and has been experienced by almost every team in Barcelona over the last few days.The likes of Russell and Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto have already raised safety concerns over the issue, which appears to have been underestimated by the vast majority of the grid.It remains to be seen whether the problem will be as prevalent when the second week of testing begins in just under a fortnight's time.
