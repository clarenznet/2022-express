Jane Seymour, 71, showed off her famous curves as she walked the red carpet at the premiere of Ruby's Choice. The glitzy event took place at Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace in Sydney, Australia. Jane modelled a figure-hugging red dress featuring a cape that billowed behind one of her shoulders, leaving the other side bare. The long gown revealed some nude peep-toe shoes underneath and was accessorised with a matching sparkly necklace and bracelet. The fabulous actress showed off her youthfulness with her hair down and staple straight fringe. She opted for natural-looking makeup and accentuated eyebrows paired with thick eyeliner. Jane’s smile gleamed thanks to a light berry lipstick that matched her rosy cheeks.
