Liz Truss appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the latest in Ukraine as Vladimir Putin authorises "peacekeeping" troops into eastern parts of Ukraine and the West slaps down sanctions against Russia. Despite the actions of Mr Putin, the Russian President has insisted he is still looking for "diplomatic solutions" to resolve the conflict as grows angry at NATO's expansion to the east. Ms Truss branded the comments as "incredible" before saying something "disturbing" about Mr Putin's ambition and the likelihood of the UK going to war. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Ms Truss was grilled over the latest events surrounding Ukraine and Russia and what the UK would be doing to resolve the issue. Reflecting on Mr Putin's diplomatic comments, the Foreign Secretary said: "Well, what I think he said is completely incredible. "It's very clear Russia is not taking diplomacy serious, this week they declared and recognised two parts of the sovereign territory of Ukraine - they said Ukraine had no right to exist." Ms Truss said over 100,000 troops have been amassed on the border and said Russia's pursuit of diplomacy was "not credible".
