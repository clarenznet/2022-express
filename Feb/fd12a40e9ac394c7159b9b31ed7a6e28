Arlene, 78, collected her award at Windsor Castle for services to dance and charity. Afterwards she said: "I'm feeling very emotional. Walking into that glorious room and then speaking to the Princess Royal was just so beautiful. "I was really overcome with emotion, I was chatting away and thinking, 'Please don't cry'." Meanwhile, Sue Barker, 65, got her CBE for services to sport, broadcasting and charity from Prince William, also at Windsor.She said: "I was absolutely terrified.
