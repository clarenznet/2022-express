The 30-year-old Swede, who played Astrid in Vikings on the History Channel, will next be seen in Snow Angels on Channel 4 next month – a dark drama filmed in Stockholm. She said: “The Crown is a very big one in Sweden for us. It does well for you here in the UK, obviously.” Sweden has a trimmed-down monarchy which is very similar to the so-called “bicycle” modest monarchies of other Scandinavian countries – but Josefin said there was a deeper link. She said: “What really connects Swedes and Britons is that humour. I love your sense of humour and sarcasm… But it is the dark material you get to see [in Nordic noir]. “In our realistic dramas we have connected with more people than we think, especially in Snow Angels. We bring taboos, a mother who takes drugs when she has a five-week-old baby. It’s daring to bring that up.”
