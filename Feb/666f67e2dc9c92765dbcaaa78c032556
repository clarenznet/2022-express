Manchester United are prepared to offload up to 11 players this summer as part of a mass exodus, reports claim. While Ralf Rangnick and the current squad are working hard to ensure they make something of United's season, the majority of the team are also playing for their futures at the club. That's because, at the end of the season, United are set to focus their efforts on overhauling the squad under the supervision of a new manager. United are prepared to go to extra lengths - including multiple sales and big spending - to ensure the new coach can build a team that fits his vision. It is likely to require some patience but at the same time, United are now desperate for trophies and success after falling behind Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. The club have already settled for fourth place in February - a position the board would snap your hand off for - as they look to secure Champions League football for next season.
