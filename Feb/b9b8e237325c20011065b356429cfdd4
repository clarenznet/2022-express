Sole Bliss have claimed that the Duke of Sussex and Duchess of Cornwall both suffer from a condition known as bunions. A bunion is a bony joint that forms on the base of your toe and can cause some of the bones in the front of your foot to move out of place.  According to the NHS, symptoms include hard lumps on the side of your feet, hard or swollen skin and your big toe pointing towards the other toes. In 2018, the Duchess said she was “screaming out in agony at the end of the day” after wearing high heels. According to Sole Bliss, she also said due to the pain she would have to stop wearing high heels. She said: “That’s just one thing I have to accept.  “I’ve gone down to two inches – can’t do any more.” However, now Camilla has specially designed shoes, allowing her to stand and walk all day in heels. The Duchess has 11 pairs which she uses during public engagements. Her favourite pair reportedly costs £149 and have been recycled 80 times since June 2018.

According to podiatrists his condition is likely the result of his service in the Armed Forces and spending many hours on his feet. Sole Bliss has sent 2 pairs of their "Miracle Trainers" to Harry, the company revealed. They cost £189 and will be available in 4 colours. Alternatively the Duke could follow the example of his wife who also suffers from the condition and undergo bunion surgery.
