Former Chelsea midfielder Gus Poyet has suggested that Thomas Tuchel's position as manager could be called into question if the Blues fail to win another major trophy before the end of the season. The European champions came agonisingly close to lifting the Carabao Cup on Sunday but were ultimately denied by Liverpool at the end of a tense penalty shoot-out under the Wembley lights. Neither side were able to break the deadlock over 120 minutes of football, with a number of goals being disallowed for various offsides over the course of the match.Kepa Arrizabalaga was then called into action with just a minute of extra time remaining to replace Edouard Mendy between the sticks for the upcoming shoot-out.However, he failed to save a single spot-kick before firing his own effort into the stands to hand the Carabao Cup to Liverpool for the first time since 2012.Chelsea have already won two trophies since the beginning of the campaign after their Super Cup and Club World Cup triumphs earlier in the season.Despite this, Poyet is wary that Tuchel may be walking a tightrope in the summer if he is unable to clinch another Champions League title over the coming months. JUST IN: Ousmane Dembele sends message to Man Utd and Chelsea The former Brighton and Hove Albion boss went on to highlight the previous departure of Frank Lampard, who also spent hefty fees in the transfer market before he was sacked after failing to live up to expectations."It’s been proven that you have to win something at Chelsea [to stay in a job]," Poyet told Bettingexpert."The Champions League victory gave him [Tuchel] a little bit of time, but without a doubt, it will depend on what happens before the end of this season."If he finishes on a high with another Champions League trophy, there won’t be a change. "Now, if they go through a bad spell, things don’t go your way and you’re out of the Champions League, out of everything, then history tells us how it works at Chelsea."I think they’re strong enough to finish well, so I wouldn’t be that negative in terms of the manager. I can’t see Chelsea changing managers now."But at the beginning of the season I thought it would be Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea going for the title."For a similar situation, Frank Lampard paid the price and left Chelsea after signing players for £50million, £60m and £70m. It didn’t work and he was out."
