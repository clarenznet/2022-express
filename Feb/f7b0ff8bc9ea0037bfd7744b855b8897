Jeremy Clarkson, 61, has posted his sadness in regards to the invasion of Ukraine which took place yesterday morning. The star posted an Instagram photo of himself in Ukraine as well as a tweet about the situation. He posted a picture of himself several years ago in the country and explained that it was an even “sadder” place now. The snap, which he shared to his 4.4 million followers, was taken from Top Gear's Ukraine special back in 2014. The photo showed Jeremy standing in front of the abandoned Pripyat amusement park, which is located near Chernobyl in Ukraine. He wrote in the caption: “It was sad then. It’s even sadder now.” READ MORE: ABBA star Björn Ulvaeus splits from wife Lena Kallersjo after 41 years Fans of Jeremy from Ukraine and all over the world commented on the post in praise of the star. @Andorei.andorei wrote: “Thanks from Ukraine Jazza.” (sic) @Freddiecarr said: “Ur a good lad jezza” (sic) @Tutsloeslo penned: “And it's sad for all of us, even in Russia, we don't support this” @Tiptreegangsta said: “Pray for Ukraine” @Okelljellberger commented: “Thank you for recognising this @jeremyclarkson1 My wife is Ukrainian and we have family in Kyiv.
