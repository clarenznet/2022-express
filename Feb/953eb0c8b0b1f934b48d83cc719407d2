The 34-year-old businessman, whose father Nikolai is an old friend of the Kremlin tyrant, wed Putin’s daughter Katerina, 35, nine years ago. Shamalov was then allowed to buy $380million in shares of Kremlin-linked petrochemical giant Sibur for just $100. Dubbed the “$380million wedding gift”, the deal meant he soon became Russia’s youngest billionaire, but he and Katerina divorced in 2018. Shamalov is said to have given up his stake in Sibur for almost nothing after being expelled from Putin’s elite. He is now understood to be married to Zhanna Volkova, a glamorous socialite with strong connections to London. Shamalov is one of eight prominent wealthy Russians to receive sanctions.
