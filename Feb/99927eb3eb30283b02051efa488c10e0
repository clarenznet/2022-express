Alexander Zverev was kicked out of the Mexican Open on Tuesday after an X-rated rant at an umpire, which he followed up by smashing the match official's chair with his racket multiple times. Footage shows the umpire flinching in fear as Zverev thrashes his racket against the chair. The German, 24, was playing a doubles match with Brazilian star Michael Melo in a bid to win the title for the second time in four years. They faced Britain's Lloyd Glasspool and Finland's Harri Heliovaara for a place in the quarter-finals and were expected to win as clear favourites. The first set went to the underdogs, 6-2, leaving no room for error in the second and third for Zverev and Melo. Yet despite their second set win, the duo lost the third set 10-6, with Zverev losing his cool straight after and attacking the umpire's chair with his racket. Video footage of Zverev smashing his racket against the umpire's chair shows the official's knee flinching each time the player does so. The incident came after the world No 3 disagreed with a call made during the match, after which Zverev let out a range of expletives. He said: “Look where the ball bounced. It’s 8-6 in the tie-break, look where the ball bounced. For f*** sake, it’s your line. “It’s f****** your line. You f****** idiot.” And he added after the match finished: “You f*****g destroyed the whole f*****g match. The whole f*****g match.” Zverev believed a ball was unfairly called out during the tie-break, much to the crowd's dismay. The German and Melo then lost the game on the next point to spark serious anger from the Hamburg-born star. He will likely face serious repercussions for his actions. The Telegraph report that Zverev will likely face a fine and may even serve a suspension. The Mexican Open have already withdrawn him from the singles tournament, where he was due to face Peter Gojowczyk. His compatriot has now been given a free pass into the quarter-finals. And the ATP condemned his actions with a statement. "Due to unsportsmanlike conduct at the conclusion of his doubles match on Tuesday night, Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the tournament in Acapulco," it read.
