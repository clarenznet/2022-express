A study found 77 percent are "concerned" about rising inflation and the impact on their bills and living expenses. And 55 percent of 2,000 people quizzed for Moneybox have already tried to offset rising costs by giving up luxuries or non-essentials. Now the savings and investment app has created an Inflation Time Machine at moneyboxapp.com/inflation-calculator to help people get to grips, helping them to offset price rises over time. Charlotte Oates at Moneybox said: "The trouble with inflation is that it's often only felt once your money has been spent, and you realise it isn't stretching as far as it used to. "The Inflation Time Machine will help give you a clearer picture of how you might be affected, so you can plan ahead and still make progress towards achieving your financial goals." The survey also found 28 percent are budgeting more while 25 percent are trying to boost savings. Others, found OnePoll, are selling spare things (23 percent), going out less (22 percent) and buying second-hand (17 percent).
