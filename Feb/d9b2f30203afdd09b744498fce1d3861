A collection of the dolls - once popular but now considered racist - was visible in the background of a Facebook picture shared by Isle of Wight Council's Lora Peacey-Wilcox. But in a further twist, the 58-year-old, who has denied owning the dolls, has contacted police claiming to be the victim of a hate crime. After three months in which infuriated councillors say she has offered "no explanation" or "apology", the controversy came to a head at a full meeting at County Hall in Newport. It descended into a shouting match. There were calls of "racism" as well as members of the public shouting "bullying" and "harassment". At one point council chairman Geoff Brodie was forced to clear the public gallery before the meeting could continue last Wednesday. Cllr Joe Robertson told her: "If you were leader of a London council you would have had to resign. Do you think the ethnic minority population on the Isle of Wight are too small in number to bother about?" Cllr Warren Drew, of the Conservative Group, added: "It is important a full account is given so that the island's reputation can be protected." Cllr Brodie, 64, said: "In my view she should resign." Cllr Peacey-Wilcox, a member of the Alliance Group who lives in Cowes, refused to answer questions and insisted she would respond in writing. Hampshire Constabulary confirmed they were investigating.
