If anything could be more menacing in BBC One’s period gangster drama than the old Tommy Shelby after several whiskies, it was this new one, chillingly sober. Not because there wouldn’t come a time when he’d lash out, but because we knew for sure he still would – only now with a measured, calculated brutality. About to discover that was one of this Newfoundland bar’s customers, a bootlegger facing ruin thanks to the ending of prohibition, angrily confronting this abstemious stranger. Ironically, the stranger may have an alternative business proposition for him, once his face has been fixed. An equally criminal one, naturally. Casual violence is such a key element of Peaky Blinders, it’s a wonder some of us can bear to watch. But we do. Even me, who normally faints during Casualty. Series five attracted seven million viewers. It’ll be even more for its swan song. By normal standards, last night’s opener was actually quite low on brutality. But give it time. What we did get was plenty of its simmering intensity. Peaky Blinders is always happy to let the atmosphere build, unlike so many dramas where it feels like the cast have a bus to catch. And it continues to be shot with such style, rather like lots of its characters have been. The edgy modern soundtrack, too, remains genius. Particularly impressive was last night’s handling of the death of fearsome Aunt Polly, left. With the passing of actress Helen McCrory last year, it needed to send Polly on her way in a manner that felt respectful both to the character and to the woman who’d played her so magnificently.  By including her among the characters murdered to teach Tommy a lesson – and with her son Michael (Finn Cole) swearing Tommy must pay – it did more than a fitting job, paving the way for all sorts of feuding and savagery. It’s what she would have wanted.
