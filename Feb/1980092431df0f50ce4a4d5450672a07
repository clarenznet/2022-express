The group of "moron" motorists attempted to take advantage of the heavy rainfall by driving 4x4s across a wet field on Sunday in Glutton Bridge, Derbyshire. Photos show one Land Rover wedged under a narrow footbridge on the farm, which is said to have suffered further agricultural damage as a result of the "irresponsible" behaviour. Derbyshire Rural Crime Team, part of the county's police force, shared the images on Facebook, asking members of public to help identify those responsible. "Now, unfortunately, the irresponsible off-road driving morons spoil the reputation of the rest (off road community)," the post reads. "A group of drivers amused themselves by tearing up some agricultural so, if anyone has any other footage of this lot where their registration plates can be read, we’d love to hear from you so we can get on with prosecuting them." It happened after downpours lashed across the country, reports Derbyshire Live. River Derwent, which runs through nearby town Matlock, burst its banks during Storm Eunice's rage. Large swathes of rural areas remain impacted by floods and saturated rivers. And Derbyshire Rural Crime Team was quick to poke fun at the driver whose car was pictured submerged on Sunday. It continued: "Make up your own minds about the one who clearly misjudged the conditions, the capabilities of his vehicle and his own driving skills (or her, of course!). "Once the water levels recede it will be interesting to see what sort of recovery operation the owner comes up with." Anyone with information can contact the team via the non-emergency number 101.
