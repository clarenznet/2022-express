Ukraine is being invaded by Russia, with reports of shelling, injured soldiers and Ukrainians fleeing the country. The west has condemned the actions of Vladimir Putin, who despite sanctions and warnings has pressed forwards with action against Ukraine. NATO has released a statement saying it "stands with the people of Ukraine" and "will always maintain our full support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters." NATO said additional defensive land and air forces will be sent to the eastern part of the Alliance, as well as additional maritime assets deployed - warning Russia's actions "will have geostrategic consequences." The EU has echoed this, imposing "restrictive measures" against Russia - including freezing Russian assets and has said it stands united with NATO. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also today announced a raft of restrictive measures against Russia, but should the UK and EU go one step further? Should UK armed forces join EU's for combined response against Putin? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
