"If there's high stress we need to bring the stress under control. "Coffee makes that worse."  However, there are four foods women should "definitely" avoid during menopause in order to slim down.

The most inflammatory foods are "gluten-containing foods, as gluten is highly inflammatory, dairy is another one, sugar obviously and processed food," according to the expert. "So we need to get back to eating real foods," she added.
