Having reunited in 2016 for their Not in This Lifetime Tour, Guns N’ Roses travelled the world raking in an incredible $584 million over three years. Now post-pandemic and they’ve continued performing in US stadiums before the band head to other regions including Europe later this year. Axl Rose and the guys also released two new singles last year in Absurd and Hard Skool, which found their origins in the Chinese Democracy album sessions. But now a new record is on the way.

I would imagine that there will be one or two songs that come out around the time that we hit the road in June.” Last month, the rock guitarist also alluded to a brand new Guns N’ Roses album being on the way, the band’s first since 2008. Chatting to Classic Rock magazine last month, the 56-year-old said: “That’s a whole other interview!” However, he did admit more music is definitely coming.
