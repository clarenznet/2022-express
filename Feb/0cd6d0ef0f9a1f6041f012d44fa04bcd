But a bill of hundreds of pounds more took their breath away and seemed incomprehensible, they told Crusader.  Customers Martina and Eric Berger brought forward their flight with British Airways (BA) to Vancouver from this autumn to May. “The charge to us for doing the switch was £300 per person administration fee and the additional fare cost of £275 per ticket,” explained Martina. “We realised the tickets could well cost more, it was the size of the admin charge we were unhappy with. Our tickets were business class so £50 or £100 even would have been more appropriate. ++ If you've been affected by this issue or feel you've been a victim of injustice, please contact consumer champion Maisha Frost on maisha.frost@express.co.uk ++; When they called and questioned the figures Martina claims, “we were told promotions are separate and our booking was before the ‘no fee’ promise”.
