Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has announced he is handing over the reigns of the club to the "trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation" amid Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine. The Russian billionaire has maintained a silent ownership of Chelsea throughout his time at the helm of the west London club.  But Abramovich released a statement on Saturday night that he was handing the "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to the club's charitable foundation. He said on Chelsea's official website: "During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the Club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities. "I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. "That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. "I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans."
