Britain's economy is booming after Brexit, with the manufacturing industry now one of the "largest" in the world, according to a new report. The boost to the UK's economy is just one of the Brexit promises coming to fruition, however, there are concerns the EU still has a hold on the UK. With escalating tensions in Ukraine and Russia, some have accused the bloc of "bullying" Prime Minister Boris Johnson into taking action. Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib voiced his concerns to Express.co.uk, saying Mr Johnson has addressed the Ukraine crisis but failed to look at the issues closer to home - such as the Northern Ireland protocol. Mr Habib wrote: "The EU, like Putin, is a bully. Bullies do not relent unless they are met by a strong opposing force." He said: "Mrs Truss should, in fact, use the Ukrainian situation to our advantage. This is the time to strike back at the EU." So is Britain truly free after Brexit? Or are we still paralysed by EU?
