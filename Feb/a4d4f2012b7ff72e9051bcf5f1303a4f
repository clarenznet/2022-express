Gary Lineker, 61, spoke out earlier today on his outrage as he fired off a foul-mouthed tirade on Twitter. The Match of the Day presenter could not contain his anger as he warned Europe was “on the brink of war”. In view of his 8.3 million followers, Gary tweeted: “On the brink of war in Europe. “Human beings are remarkable creatures. “After millions of years of evolvement, we’ve been given just enough intelligence to be really f**king stupid.” The post quickly gained attention from other Twitter users, receiving more than 17,000 likes in less than an hour. Some social media accounts agreed with Gary and voiced their indignation as they replied to his tweet. JohnMcBrideIRE said: “Our Government's, if it does come to war, don't expect any of them to be in the trenches when it matters. “It's absolutely outrageous that they can make us feel this way!” GentBetClub added: “Are we on the brink of war? “I hope one day everybody could be as intelligent as you Gary. “What a day that would be!” MythFcb typed: “We don’t deserve this earth at all. “We come here create pollution, wars, and ruin everything that was once natural and beautiful.” JWLFC7 stated: “What is this all about, why can we not all be friends and have peace.” Gary’s post was a far cry from yesterday’s message for the Queen, who has tested positive for coronavirus. The TV star took to the social media website to send her his support following the worrying news. A Buckingham Palace statement on Sunday announced that the monarch was experiencing mild symptoms of Covid-19. "Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week," the statement read. "She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines." In a tweet sent following the update, Gary said: “The Queen has tested positive for Covid. “Wish her a speedy and full recovery.”
