Dictators would never allow reporters to follow them to another nation's capital and pummel them with questions on problems back home. But our prime ministers expect to be held to account by a free press. There was a special poignancy to this moment, because millions of Ukrainians who lived under Soviet communism remember being denied such liberties. These same citizens, together with legions of young Ukrainians, are determined to preserve their democracy and ready to defend it from Russian aggression. Mr Johnson was absolutely right to go to Kiev and make it clear that Britain stands with Ukraine in solidarity. It would be crassly cynical to suggest this was an attempt to shift attention away from domestic challenges; it is in our national interest to ensure that a horrific war does not erupt in Europe. We know to our cost that no British prime minister can afford to neglect threats to peace and liberty. The Kremlin must abandon its attempts to intimidate Ukraine. Britons have an instinctive loathing of bullies, and the Ukrainian people have every right to enjoy the freedoms that undergird our precious democracy. ----------------- THE news that the Government incurred Â£8.7billion of losses on PPE purchased in 2020-21 is sickening.
