Speaking during a taped national TV interview, Mr Blinken was asked by reporters on Putin’s ambitions. Mr Blinken said that he thought Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to “reconstitute” a “Soviet Empire”  He said: “You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. “He has made clear he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire. “Short of that he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighbouring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc.” However, Mr Blinken said NATO would thwart Mr Putin’s ambitions particularly if he attacked a member state which would invoke article 5.  He said: “Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders. “There's something very powerful standing in his way. “That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all.” Separately in a conference call with US lawmakers Mr Blinken said he thought it would be a “bloody mess” for Russia.
