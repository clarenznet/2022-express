Having started performing live with his father in 2018, Matteo Bocelli is finally ready to go it alone. Last year, Andrea Bocelli’s son released his debut single Solo, followed last month by Close. Now the 24-year-old has released his third, which is also his first in Spanish. The new track is titled Dime and was written with Italian superstar Mahmood and singer-songwriter Sylvia Tofani. Produced by Jesse Shaken, the song will also be released in Italian as Dimmi, its original version, on Friday March 4, 2022. Just like Solo and Close, Dime will be included on Matteo’s upcoming first album, which will be released at some point later this year. The new music video sees Matteo playing the acoustic guitar on a rooftop, alongside the portrayal of events around a city with a love interest.

The 63-year-old said: “I believe that Matteo is identifying with more and more clarity his own style, according to his own personality and sensibilities. And I believe that his very promising single Solo shows that. As for duets, it is true that the song Fall On Me was a beautiful occasion that we have seized upon as a family, perhaps without truly thinking it through but with great enthusiasm. And the public appreciated the genuineness of the emotions involved. But I also think that my son has, today, wings strong enough to take flight by himself.”
