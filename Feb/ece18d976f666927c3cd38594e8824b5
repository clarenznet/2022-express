Alexander Zverev could be suspended from competition for a whole year after his outburst at the Mexican Open. The world No 3 was withdrawn from the tournament after smashing the umpire’s chair with his racket at the conclusion of his doubles loss alongside Marcelo Melo. He now faces a large fine and suspension from the tour. Zverev was the defending champion in the singles at this week’s Abierto Mexicano Telcel and had also entered the doubles draw alongside his good friend and former doubles No 1 Marcelo Melo. The pair got a walkover to the second round where they were defeated by Lloyd Glasspool and Harri Heliovaara in a match tiebreak 6-2 4-6 10-6 on Tuesday evening. At the conclusion of the match, Zverev walked over to the umpire’s chair and repeatedly smashed it with his racket, at footage showed the umpire flinching in fear. The world No 3 continued his x-rated tirade, shouting: “You f*****g destroyed the whole f*****g match. The whole f*****g match.” JUST IN: Murray crashes out of Dubai Championships with Sinner loss  His outburst was sparked by a call during the first-to-ten match tiebreak, when the German thought a ball had been unfairly called out. Shortly after after his surge of anger, both the tournament and the ATP Tour confirmed Zverev had been withdrawn from the tournament, leaving him unable to defend his singles title with his round-of-16 opponent Peter Gojowczyk given a walkover to the quarters. “Due to unsportsmanlike conduct at the conclusion of his doubles match on Tuesday night, Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the tournament in Acapulco,” the ATP tweeted. Having been kicked out of the tournament, the 24-year-old will be required to return his prize money and pay his hotel accommodation costs, and also forfeits any ranking points gained during the tournament as a result of his on-site disqualification from the event.

Zverev’s actions will likely be classed as “Aggravated Behaviour”, defined in the ATP rulebook as: “One or more incidents of behavior designated in this Code as constituting aggravated behaviour,” or “one incident of behavior that is flagrant and particularly injurious to the success of a tournament, or is singularly egregious, including the sale of credentials.” Players who are found to engage in aggravated behaviour face heavy sanctions, including “a fine up to $25,000 (£18,394) or the amount of prize money won at the tournament, whichever is greater”. The Olympic champion could also be suspended from the tour for as long as one year, with the rulebook also outlining another sanction: “Suspension from play in ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour tournaments or events for a minimum period of twenty-one (21) days and a maximum period of one (1) year. “The suspension shall commence on the Monday after the expiration of the time within which an appeal may be filed, or, in the case of appeal, commencing on the Monday after a final decision on appeal.” An investigation would take place away from the tournament and potentially after its conclusion this weekend. Zverev is already under investigation by the ATP Tour for allegations of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend Olga ‘Olya’ Sharypova but the tour has come under fire for failing to contact Sharypova in the five months since announcing the inquiry. “The allegations raised against Alexander Zverev are serious and we have a responsibility to address them,” ATP chief executive Massimo Calvelli said in a statement at the beginning of October. “We hope our investigation will allow us to establish the facts and determine appropriate follow-up action. We understand Zverev welcomes our investigation and acknowledge that he has denied all allegations.”
