Chelsea’s negotiations with Andreas Christensen are currently dead, paving the way for his exit at the end of the season. The Dane will be out of contract in the summer amid interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Chelsea’s contract talks are dead with Christensen and it now looks almost certain that he will leave the club this summer. The Dane’s current terms expire at the end of the season and it is looking increasingly likely that he could leave for nothing at the end of the season. It is quite the turnaround from last summer where all parties were relaxed with a renewal looking more of a formality. But a late change in representation during negotiations through a spanner in the works while interest from other clubs grew. And according to the Telegraph, Christensen is now set to leave this summer when his contract expires. The only way the defender will stay at the club is whether his agent accepts one of the offers made to him earlier in the season. However, that appears highly unlikely after those negotiations already broke down and plenty of interest in his services. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are keen on the 25-year-old, though he has yet to make a decision on his future. Chelsea are facing a potential exodus in defence this summer with Christensen one of three key players who could leave for nothing. Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger will be out of contract at the end of the season and there are clubs looking to snap them up. While the former is also attracting attention from Barcelona, Atletico Madrid are also reported to be keen on the Spaniard. But there is renewed hope that Rudiger could pen a new deal at Stamford Bridge after it looked certain that he would depart earlier in the campaign. Real Madrid looked set to land the German on a free transfer but he was unhappy with the contract offer that was proposed. And Chelsea could be ready to meet his demands after becoming a key part of Thomas Tuchel’s side.
