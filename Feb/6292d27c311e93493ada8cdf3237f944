Finally, the one day of the year where you can have the same meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner, is upon us - Pancake Day. But those already keen to don their apron and get out the lemon and sugar will have to wait a little longer this year, as Shrove Tuesday is later than usual in 2022. This year Pancake Day will fall on Tuesday, March 1. Shrove Tuesday falls later than it normally would this year, given the day is most often marked in February. However, having a Pancake Day in March isn’t unusual as the day is always marked in either month. Why do we celebrate Pancake Day? Pancake Day is a traditional feast day to mark the beginning of Lent, which begins on Ash Wednesday. Pancakes have a comparatively long history compared to other foods we eat today, with cooking books as far back as 1439 containing recipes for them. Shrove Tuesday was the last opportunity to use up eggs and fats before embarking on the Lenten fast - and what better way to use them than making pancakes. The day marks the end of Pre-Lenten Season, also known as Shrovetide. Traditionally Catholics would begin to abstain from eating meat, eggs and animal produce for 40 days after Shrove Tuesday. Many still do, but now it’s more common to give up a guilty pleasure or bad behaviour for the period. Anglo-Saxon Catholics would attend confession at their parish church, where they would be ‘shriven’, or forgiven for their sins.  DON'T MISSWhen is Mother's Day 2022?
