The Prime Minister will update MPs on the latest situation after President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on its European neighbour overnight. He will outline in Parliament further sanctions to be imposed on Moscow today to punish the Kremlin for its attacks. Ahead of the anticipated announcement, foreign minister James Cleverly said an "unprecedented" level of economic measures would be brought forward to cripple Russia's economy. He said: "We will be bringing forward in close concert with our international friends and allies, an unprecedented sanctions response, coordinated sanctions response, to punish this appalling decision." Mr Johnson warned Russia earlier this week that crippling measures had already been drawn up to impose should an attack be launched. The Government introduced measures on Monday against five Russian banks and three Russian billionaires after Moscow recognised two rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine as breakaway republics.

"Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe’s tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail," he said this morning following the overnight invasion. Airstrikes were also launched by Moscow against Ukraine. Kiev said at least eight people had been killed and nine wounded by Russian shelling. "We must now match our rhetoric with action. "We must urgently reinforce our Nato allies. "The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. "The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK. And those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia’s actions must reckon with their own consciences."
