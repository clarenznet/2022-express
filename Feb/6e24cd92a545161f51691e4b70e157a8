National Highways in the West Midlands said at around 7:30am: “The #M6 is closed southbound between J4 (M42) and J3a (M6 Toll) due to a serious collision.” Reports say a multi-vehicle collision is behind the delays, which are also affecting the m42. In a full statement, National Highways said: “The M6 is closed southbound between junction 4 (M42) and junction 3a (M6 Toll) due to a collision. “Warwickshire Police lead the response to the ongoing incident and have closed the carriageway to allow them to work at scene. “National Highways have resources in attendance to assist with traffic management.” They also advised drivers to exit at J4 and take the A446 south, continue along the A446/A452 southwards to its junction with the A45 (Stonebridge), take the exit to the A45 eastbound, continue to the A46 junction (Tollbar end), take the A46 northbound, and then re-join the M6 at J3. A man has been taken to hospital following a three vehicle collision on the M6 this morning, police have confirmed. A Warwickshire Police spokeswoman told Coventry Live: "We were called at 7.25am this morning to a report of a three vehicle collision on M6, near J4. "Emergency services including fire, ambulance and Highways England are currently in attendance. "One man has been taken to hospital by ambulance." Maps from Traffic England say “the event is expected to clear between 10:30 and 10:45 on 28 February 2022”. Traffic information website Inrix is reporting: "M6 Southbound closed, stationary traffic due to multi-vehicle accident from J4 M42 (Coleshill) to J3 A444 Bedworth Bypass (Nuneaton/Coventry). "Congestion to J5 (Castle Bromwich). Traffic on the M42 is very busy as they cannot access the M6 here either. Traffic on the A45 from Stonebridge Island is very slow as traffic diverts." It comes after an accident on Monday morning on the M6 after a rush hour crash near Wigan. All lanes are now open after the accident on the southbound carriageway, but the earlier closure has caused congestion between J24 (Ashton-in-Makerfield) and J23 (Haydock). Delays should start to ease, but there is currently around four miles of congestion which is adding about 30 minutes to normal journey times. Traffic is still slow moving back to J26 (M58 Orrell interchange).
