The Samsung Galaxy S22 range launched on Friday, with Android fans at long last able to pick up an S22, S22+ or S22 Ultra. In the run-up to the S22 release date Samsung was offering an incredible trade-in deal that offered a huge saving of up to £570. That deal has now run out, but if you're looking to trade-in a device you can still save hundreds of pounds on the price of a Galaxy S22, S22+ or S22 Ultra when you head to EE. The leading mobile operator is offering a saving of £14 per month, which works out as £336 on the total cost of an S22 contract when you trade in an eligible device. If you take advantage of this trade-in deal you'll be able to pick up an S22 from £35 a month, instead of the regular £49 a month fee with EE. For this price you'll get an S22 with 4GB of monthly data as well as unlimited calls and texts. You'll also need to pay a £100 upfront fee. Prices when you trade-in a device for the S22+ begin from £43 a month, while for the S22 Ultra it's from £55 a month when you trade in an eligible phone. These prices also include a £100 upfront cost. Besides the saving you get from trading in a device anyone that gets an S22, S22+ or S22 Ultra from EE will also be able to claim a free pair of Galaxy Buds Pro worth £219. EE will also throw in six months worth of access to Apple Music as an additional freebie bonus.

This device is more like a Note phone than a Galaxy S device, boasting a phablet style shape akin to the Note range along with square-edges instead of the S22 and S22 Plus's more rounded corners.

If that's not enough, the S22 Ultra has one big design difference over its younger siblings. Unlike the S22 and S22+, the Ultra doesn't have a camera bump for the rear sensors. This gives the back of the S22 Ultra a striking, minimalistic look that's different to any other flagship out there. It's an eye-catching design that not only will turn plenty of heads but clearly separates it in looks from the rest of the S22 line.
