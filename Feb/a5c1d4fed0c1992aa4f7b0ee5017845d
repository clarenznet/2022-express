The 55-year-old man tried to submerge Lady Anastasia, a £5 million vessel on which he has worked as a mechanic for around a decade. The man was arrested and has since been released after explaining the situation to authorities. He was quoted as saying: "I don't regret anything I've done and I would do it again." It is believed the man tried to sink the luxury yacht in at Pord Adriano in Majorca as an "act of revenge" against the owner of the boat, the Russian Alexander Mijeev who holds a high position in a Russian state company specialising in weapons. When the Civil Guard arrived, he turned himself in and said: "My boss is a criminal who sells weapons that kill the Ukrainian people." It's understood the act happened just two hours after the mechanic watched a news report about the war and saw a cruise missile attack on a building in Kyiv. The missile is one of those produced by his bosses company, Mirror.co.uk reports. The Ukrainian saboteur even had the forethought to close the fuel valves of the Lady Anastasia so that there would be no pollution. It's said he opened a large valve in the engine room and a second in a compartment where the crew lives. He told his fellow crew members his plans and said "don't worry because I will take all the blame". The man told the crewmen, also Ukrainian, to abandon ship and that he would take full responsibility. However they still tried to stop the leak along with workers from the port. It is reported the vessel is partially sunk. When the police arrived, the sailor confessed quickly but he has since been released although it is not clear if he will be charged.
