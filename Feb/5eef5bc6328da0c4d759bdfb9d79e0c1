Lawrence Okolie will be hoping to defend his WBO cruiserweight world title with a strong showing against Polish challenger Michal Cieslak this evening. The undefeated Brit will go into the bout as the overwhelming favourite to claim the spoils but could face a tricky test in overcoming the challenge posed by Cieslak if he is not careful. Cieslak has only lost once during his nine-year professional career, with his sole defeat coming in the form of a 12-round unanimous decision at the hands of Ilunga Makabu in 2020.He later followed up with two commanding stoppage wins over Taylor Mabika and Yury Kashinsky and will be hoping to upset the odds with another dominant performance tonight.Meanwhile, Okolie will be making the second defence of his WBO strap after earning a stunning third-round victory over Dilan Prasovic in his last outing back in September.He will likely face the toughest challenge of his career against Cieslak, though, and will need to be firing on all cylinders to avoid an embarrassing fall from grace at the O2 Arena.

"One of the main things that we focus on and try to keep fit is mindset."So I’m making sure that we practice the mind, practice the body, put yourself in interesting situations and hold yourself accountable."I’m ready for this, this is a stage that I was made for, this is a fight I was made for."Meanwhile, Cieslak has also underlined his ability to claim the spoils as he looks to represent his native Poland with pride at the O2 Arena."It’s surely a big fight for Polish boxing," he added. "I can’t wait to actually attend the fight, I’m training very hard, and I can’t wait to fight."If I wasn’t sure I was going to win, I wouldn’t be here, I’ve been training since I was 13 so I’m ready to get the WBO title."
