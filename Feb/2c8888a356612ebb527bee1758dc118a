So as we pause to take breath after Peter Parker's latest story comes to close, there is no better time to answer a question Marvel enthusiasts have been asking for over a decade; which MCU film or TV show is the best of the lot? Indeed, with 32 pieces of original content - and more to come - being produced since the first Iron Man hit our screen in 2008, getting folk to rank the MCU never produces the same list. To some, Black Panther doesn’t live up to the acclaim it received from critics. To others, Infinity War should be ranked higher than its successor End Game. Meanwhile, a small minority will argue that The Incredible Hulk deserves a bit more credit. Given the subjective nature of the films and TV shows, one person’s Marvel ranking won’t be definitive. That is why The Watchers have decided to create an ultimate list based on the views of you; the readers. Keen to get your view included in this ranking? Then you can submit your 1 to 32 of Marvel content using the below survey, and your opinions will be combined with other reading to produce the Ultimate MCU ranking. Your individual lists will not be shared, so please don’t be shy to admit that you did actually enjoy Thor: The Dark World. We won’t judge you at all!
