Latest warnings about the “perfect storm” created by price hikes come from both Trading Standards, which is calling for a stronger consumer protection strategy, and ethical lender Fair for You (FfY). ++ If you've been affected by this issue or feel you've been a victim of injustice, please contact consumer champion Maisha Frost on maisha.frost@express.co.uk ++; The affordable credit provider and charity-owned company (www.fairforyou.co.uk) helps people to buy home essentials like beds and cookers. Last year it pointed to the dangerous vacuum being created with the demise of costly lenders and rent-to-buy retailers. The latest squeeze is bringing dangerous new challenges for families. They should be very wary of upbeat lenders superficially presenting themselves as especially bright and friendly. A closer look may well reveal their terms or past actions – perhaps under a different name - are very pricey and hard-line. For Tom Levitt, chair of the FfY charity, “just as night follows day, wherever there are hard-pressed families there are unethical loans companies looking to make a quick buck out of them,” he warns. FfY advises: ·      Beware bright and engaging marketing ploys  – these lenders aren't your friend, they're profit-making businesses. ·      Read online reviews. If you’re looking at a newly-created company, find out who owns them and what their track record is - it could be a refreshed version of an unethical operator. ·      Only borrow what you need to - be very wary of companies who try to offer you more. ·      Make sure you understand repayment terms. Companies should be able to tell you exactly what you’ll have to repay - and whether there are penalties such as for early repayment. ·      If you need help fast remember there are plenty of non-profit alternatives available from credit unions to FfY who focus on support not exploitation.
