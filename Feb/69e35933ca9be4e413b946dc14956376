Fans were wowed by the striking star's bright orange co-ord, accented with grey stripes. The blazer hung open to reveal Megan Fox's skimpy black sports bra, which enhanced her cleavage to maximum effect, but did little to protect her from potential wardrobe malfunctions. Meanwhile, her fianc√© Machine Gun Kelly towered over his petite girlfriend, while appearing equally keen to impress, adding formidable competition in the glamour stakes. Wearing multiple piercings, sparkling jewellery, trousers, and a black sweater encrusted with dozens of glittering multicoloured gems, he stood out as much as his sensational wife-to-be. The Bloody Valentine hitmaker also stood out for one of his trademark lip cuffs, which boasted the Dolce & Gabbana logo. Transformers actress Megan had decided to stick to orange for her accessories to match with her outfit, pairing her trousers and blazer with a neon handbag and matching pair of heels. Sporting long black hair, which almost skimmed her waist, and a beautifully bronzed complexion, Megan was likely to have drawn some Kim Kardashian comparisons on the day. Besides Megan and Machine Gun Kelly, a host of other celebrities attended the event, including Adele and her NBA agent beau Rich Paul.
