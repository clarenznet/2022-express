Wordle has taken the world by storm since launching back in late 2021. One of the best things about the daily puzzle game is that players can tackle it at their own pace. Unless you're on your final guess and haven't made any letters go green, you could say that Wordle is pretty relaxing. Wordle Cup, on the other hand, is anything but relaxing. A new Wordle spinoff, Wordle Cup is a multiplayer experience where speed is everything. Playable on the Wordle Cup website, the multiplayer Wordle battle tasks players with solving each puzzle in the fastest time possible. The game works like any other tournament, with timed rounds and a scoreboard to see who wins. Upwards of eight players can compete in the tournaments, where the person with the most victories wins the cup. There are also various custom rulesets, giving players the ability to create a room, decide the number of rounds, the duration of rounds and even the length of the words. It's currently in the beta testing phase, although it seems to be pretty stable. You can play it on browsers and smartphones. As a reminder, the Wordle letter tiles will show up in one of three colours once you make a guess. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. With the popularity of the game soaring - thanks to its celebrity following and competitive element - hundreds of "Wordle apps" have appeared in iPhone and Android.
