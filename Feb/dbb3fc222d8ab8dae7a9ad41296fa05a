A survey of more than 800 primary school staff found that six in ten had no access to new books and nearly four in 10 said they were having to buy them. The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) report found that 25 percent of schools have fewer books than they did before the pandemic. Louise Johns- Shepherd, chief executive of CLPE, said that pupils needed "a wide range of books that encourage engagement". She added: "A stagnant and never changing book stock is not going to support children to develop this life-changing habit." Cassie Chadderton, chief executive of world Book Day, said: "If children can't find books they want to read the impact cannot be underestimated."
