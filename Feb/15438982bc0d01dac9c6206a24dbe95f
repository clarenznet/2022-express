Free school meals are available to children whose parents receive Universal Credit and earn less than £7,400 a year. However, campaigners are worried that many are going hungry. Universal infant free school meals (UIFSM) were introduced for all children in reception, year one and year two back in 2014. Children in all other years only receive free school meals if their parents are receiving Universal Credit and earning less than the threshold. However, one in seven pupils who are eligible for free school meals (14 percent) aren’t claiming them according to the latest figures from the Department for Education. This is due to a number of reasons - one being that there is still a stigma attached to claiming free school meals.

She said: “It is no surprise that some children won’t take up the offer. “This is particularly apparent in secondary schools when students eligible for FMS would rather join their friends at the local shops than sit in the canteen to have a free meal.” Ms Slater explained that the universal free school meals project for younger children has been much more successful because everyone is treated the same.

A Department for Education spokesperson said: “No child should be made to feel ashamed about receiving a free school meal that helps them to concentrate in class – but the vast majority of schools use cashless systems to prevent eligible pupils from being identified separately, helping to remove any stigma. “Over 1.7 million children are eligible for free school meals, and we communicate regularly with schools and councils so they know what is available for these children."        The spokesperson continued: “We’ve substantially built on the support in place, through the National School Breakfast Programme as well as our successful Holiday Activities and Food clubs, which offers fun, enriching activities on top of a healthy meal to children during school holidays.” Meanwhile, Universal Credit claimants could also be eligible for an extra £500 top up if they are expecting a baby. Thousands of parents could qualify for a Sure Start Maternity Grant to help towards the cost of caring for a newborn. It's a one off payment that won’t affect other benefits but it can only be claimed 11 weeks before a baby’s due date or six months after the baby is born. It’s not just for those on Universal Credit - Britons on Income Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Child Tax Credit, and Working Tax Credit could also be eligible.
