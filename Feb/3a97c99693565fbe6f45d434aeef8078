The Foreign Office has urged all British nationals to leave Ukraine immediately. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority, which is why we have updated our travel advice. "We urge British nationals in Ukraine to leave now via commercial means while they remain available." Earlier today, US President Joe Biden told US citizens to leave Ukraine amid fears of a Russian invasion. It is reported dozens of commercial flights are operating between Ukraine and the UK every day. Britons can also leave the country by road by crossing into Poland. Joe Biden urged US citizens to leave as "things could go crazy very quickly". The US president also confirmed military plans to airlift Americans who had crossed the border and were currently in Poland. The UK is not preparing an emergency airlift as there are sufficient commercial flights available and the border with Poland is open, British sources said. The Foreign Office urged “those British people who choose to remain in Ukraine [to] keep their departure plans under constant review, and ensure their travel documents are up to date”. It also warned: “British nationals should not expect consular support or help with evacuating in the event of a Russian military incursion.” The UK advises British citizens against travelling to the two Russian-backed regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, located in the east of the country. Government sources said the Foreign Office is preparing to launch a crisis team to handle the escalating tensions in Ukraine.
