Any UK resident is no stranger to the near-constant drizzle and grey skies. All this rain leads to wet walking terrain and can leave you with muddy floors far more often than you may like. While there’s not much you can do about the rain, there is something you can do about the cleanup - and that's buying a boot stand to keep by the door.

Aldi is known for its handy, budget-friendly Specialbuys, and the latest one that's catching the attention of shoppers is the Wrought Iron Welly Stand. Buy: Aldi (£29.99) The Kirkton House Wrought Iron Welly Stand is made from sturdy wrought iron, and is designed to fit six pairs of wellies in two rows, giving you and the family plenty of room for those muddy wellies after a long walk. Many reviewers claimed the stand is great at helping them keep their houses clean, with one saying it’s “great for the family keeping the wet off the kitchen floors”, and another saying it “does the job to store the families welly boots, keeping the insides dry and aired”. And it’s not just wellies the stand can hold, with a few reviews saying it fits soggy sneakers too. Buy: Aldi (£29.99) The sturdiness of the wrought iron stand was mentioned frequently throughout the reviews, with one person saying it’s “a really sturdy boot rack and much heavier than I was expecting. The finish is excellent and looks more expensive than it actually is. Such a good buy!” Another added they were “really impressed with this boot stand, heavyweight so won't topple over and takes long boots easily”.
