A survey by children's comic Beano found 26 per cent had yet to visit - despite four in five parents (84 per cent) wanting their youngsters to go more often. While three-quarters have not visited in over a year, more than half of children (55 per cent) were put off because they mistakenly believe they have to be quiet. Eight in 10 parents believe their little ones are reading less than they did when they were young, with more than two-thirds (72 per cent) saying their children do not read for pleasure regularly. The average child reads six books a year, compared with their parents reading at least 10 at the same age. However, three-quarters (77 per cent) of children said they liked reading with their parents. The National Literacy Trust found the number of pupils getting five good GCSEs could rise by 1.1 million in a generation if all children read for pleasure daily. The study of 2,000 parents with children aged six and above was for the launch of Beano's Libraries Aloud reading initiative. It hopes to encourage families to head to their local library and read out loud this week, especially to mark World Book Day on Thursday. Joining in the campaign is Greg Rutherford, 35, Olympian-turned author, who will be hosting interactive online "read-out-loud-a-longs" in libraries. The father of three said: "I love reading with my kids and Beano is a great gateway to get into reading." The comic's Mike Stirling said: "We're excited to celebrate the fun and noise that is 'aloud' in libraries this World Book Day." A special edition Beano to promote the fun of reading will be released.
