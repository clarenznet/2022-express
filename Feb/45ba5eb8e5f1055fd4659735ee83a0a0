On a video posted on The Ramsey Show - Highlights YouTube channel in 2021, the American personal finance personality offered guidance to Jeff, who is in a "dying profession". With hardly any money saved in his pension funds, Jeff wanted to know how he can still have a “decent retirement”. Jeff explained to the money guru that he is in a dying industry and that he will be out of a job in five years as his plant will shut down. Jeff is debt free, but he has not got a lot saved for retirement. He makes around £120,000 (around $165,000) a year. When his plant shuts down, Jeff plans to start his own greenhouse and work for himself.

He continued: “Max out your 401K, max out your Roth IRA (tax free individual retirement account). “That’s about $40,000 (around £30,000) a year and let’s turn up the heat and see how much money we can get saved in the next five years. “Let’s pretend you saved $50,000 (around £37,000) for five years, that would be $250,000 (around £185,000) in your retirement account when you lose your job.” He explained to Jeff that while he is saving this money for retirement, he also needs to save for his greenhouse. He should be able to pay this in cash. Mr Ramsey continued: “We have two goals here that you need to budget for and you need to really lean in on that. “If you $250,000 (around £185,000) in that account and never save anything else, every seven years or so it will double of it’s in good mutual funds. “At 63, it should be $500,000 (around £370,000). "By the time you’re 70, it will be $1million (around £740,000). “But you need that $250,000 (around £185,000) in there in the next five years.”
