Victoria Beckham, 47, has dressed up glam in time for the wedding of British Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful. The editor was due to marry his long-term partner, Alec Maxwell at Longleat Estate in Wiltshire. The former spice girl dressed up in a bridal-inspired gown for the occasion, posing with her friends ahead of the start of celebrations on Tuesday. Victoria stood alongside fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen and stylist Christine Centenera. She wore a full silk ensemble with laces and a long skirt. The fashion designer wore her hair up, keeping a few strands flowing in front. On Instagram, Anders wrote about how his "dreams came true" for an evening. He penned: "Off to @edward_enninful’s birthday ball with my two dates, because prom dreams come true [sic] "Thank you @davidbeckham and @joeledgerton for letting me stand in!'"
