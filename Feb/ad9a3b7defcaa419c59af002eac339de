Companies shipped pesticides containing 12,240 tonnes of seven different chemicals prohibited in the UK in 2020, data obtained by Greenpeace and Swiss campaign group Public Eye. They received the figures through Freedom of Information request to the Health and Safety Executive, which regulates UK exports of prohibited chemicals. They included a weedkiller banned in the UK in 2007 when studies linked it to Parkinson's disease and a neonicotinoid banned from outdoor use in 2018 because it harms bees. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said: “By allowing UK-based companies to export harmful chemicals banned for use on our farms the UK government is behaving like a drug baron with the motto ‘don’t get high on your own supply’. “These double standards are deeply cynical and morally indefensible. “Far from acting like an environmental leader, the UK government is failing to keep up with the European Commission, who have rightly committed to ending export of these banned chemicals. “Ministers should consider the damage this toxic trade is doing to people and wildlife and should outlaw it immediately.” The exports are legal because of loopholes in UK law allowing companies to continue producing pesticides for export despite being banned from domestic use to protect local farmers and the environment. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: "In the case of neonicotinoids and other chemicals, the UK goes above the international standard, requiring exporting companies to confirm with countries that they have accepted any imports before [shipping]. This allows importing countries to make informed decisions." A Defra source said the government was looking into pesticides exports and would "be making decisions based on our analysis of these issues".
