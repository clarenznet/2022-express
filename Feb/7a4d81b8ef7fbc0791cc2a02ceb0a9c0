Zmiinyi Island, located in the Black Sea and also known as Snake Island, was confronted with Russian warships that demanded surrender from the Ukrainian guards posted there. A Russian warship demanded the guards lay down their weapons to avoid "bloodshed" but was met with sturdy resistance to the end. A Ukrainian soldier told the ship to "go f*** yourself" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing the 13 guards "heroically died" in their defence.   Overnight, Russia seized control of the Chernobyl power plant where the world's worst nuclear disasters happened in 1986. Ukrainian civilians have been fleeing the country and landing in Poland and other nearby nations. The world has imposed further sanctions on Russia by introducing travel bans and asset freezes with Vladimir Putin saying the invasion of Ukraine was carried out to protect Russia.

Mr Wallace told Sky News: "Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hoped-for timetable. "They've lost over 450 personnel. One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz has failed to be taken. "In fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back. "So, I think contrary to great Russian claims and indeed President Putin's sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause - he's got that completely wrong. The Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective."
