Spirited supermodel Cindy Crawford was present on Instagram to share her birthday celebrations with her six million followers. Her party post featured the radiant star blowing out candles on a cake, while a purple balloon in the shape of a 'C' hovered in the background, representing her initials. The photo attracted 25,000 likes within a mere couple of hours. Over the weekend, Cindy had led up to the big day with a throwback photo of herself celebrating her birthday as a little girl. The wide-eyed child looked thrilled in the snap, and was already a natural in front of the camera. "On the eve of another birthday, looking back at little Cindy and thinking about what I would tell her," she affectionately captioned the photo of her younger self. "I would tell her to be kinder to herself, to treat herself the way she treats her friends. I would tell her everyone feels nervous in new situations and sometimes you just have to fake it ‘til you make it. I would tell her not to be afraid to make a fool of herself— dance, sing, etc more — even if she isn’t good at it." In spite of that comment, there's little chance of Cindy seeming to be anything less than sensational in front of a camera.
