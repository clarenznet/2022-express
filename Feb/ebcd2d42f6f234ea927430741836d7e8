Shoppers have recently reported groups of up to 40 teenagers terrorising them at Stonedale Retail Park near Norris Green, Liverpool. They've intimidated people, stole delivery bikes and even caused damage to bus stops and shop windows. One customer, who visited the retail park last week, said: "There must have been 40 or more of them causing trouble, sitting on parked cars, jumping in front of cars, spitting, swearing and hanging around the doors of McDonald’s pushing people as they came in or out." Merseyside Police have received reports of anti-social behaviour and have introduced more patrols in the area as a result in the last few days. But speaking to Liverpool Echo, another customer said tougher punishments are needed. He added: "Verbal warnings won’t deter these yobs , they just return and carry on next day or even later the same day. They or their parents need to be given a hefty fine." A spokesperson for Merseyside Constabulary said: "Merseyside Police provided high visibility patrols in the area around Stonedale retail park on Wednesday (February 23) as part of the dispersal zone in place. "Officers engaged with groups of youths in the area and issued verbal warnings. "We will continue to work to tackle anti-social behaviour in our communities across Merseyside and where we receive reports of such behaviour, we won’t hesitate to take action. "If you witness any anti-social behaviour or have any information about such incidents, please contact or speak to our officers and we will act." Always call 999 if a crime is in progress. You can pass any information on anti-social behaviour via our social media desk @MerPolCC on Twitter or 'Merseyside Police Contact Centre' on Facebook.
