Due to an obsession with bricks and mortar, I’d already managed to invest in my first two bedroom flat. At such a young age, I was on the ‘ladder’ and it felt amazing – my obsession had begun. My nose was constantly pressed up against estate agents’ windows (no Rightmove in those days) and it wasn’t just the outside I was interested in either.  I loved looking at interior magazines for inspiration, and my dad even remembers me as a child, nosily peering into people’s windows to see how they’d arranged their living rooms!  When I eventually landed the job of fronting Homes Under The Hammer, BBC1’s daytime hit show, it really was – to coin a cliché – a dream come true.  Since then, I’ve moved house well over 10 times. Helping others do the same and to not feel daunted by the prospect of buying at auction was a natural fit. I bought my current home at auction; it’s a far easier process than people realise and certainly works for me. You just need an eye for a bargain. I presented the show for 13 very happy years and often get asked what I miss.  Well, there’s my TV husband, Martin Roberts, for one, though we were happily reunited last week when we flew to Scotland to film Paddy McGuinness’ Celebrity Catchpoint.  I’m not going to say too much, as it will air soon but, what I will admit is, it’s the most I’ve laughed in ages and I can’t wait for you to see it.  I also get asked if I’d ever return to Hammer. The answer is, who knows? Never say never. I certainly miss it and would love to keep the door open.  On the subject of doors, I could recommend some incredible paint colours for the front…
