Engelbert Humperdinck had been gearing up for his Valentine’s Day live stream ready to go at 2pm PST (10pm GMT) today. The 85-year-old was hoping to talk about his love songs and what they mean to people in the special broadcast. But now a statement cancelling the event has been shared on the singer’s official Twitter account. The statement read: “We regret to inform you that today’s Valentine’s Day Live Stream on Engelbert’s YouTube Channel has been cancelled. Unfortunately, a fatal accident took a close member of his family late last night. Engelbert is heartbroken and too distressed to celebrate today’s holiday. Due to these unforeseen circumstances, we will have to reschedule a Live Stream for a later date. Engelbert asks your forgiveness and appreciates your understanding.” Fans were quick to send their love in the comments, sharing how so very sorry they were to hear such sad news. Engelbert is set to continue his US tour in Florida on February 25, before heading off for a string of concerts in Europe this April. This is set to include a performance at The London Palladium on April 25. However, it’s unclear at this stage if his tour will be postponed due to the recent bereavement. Last November, the 85-year-old star was forced to cancel his entire UK tour after falling very ill.
