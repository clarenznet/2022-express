A person must be aged between five to 21 to qualify. The scheme will give provide free travel on all registered bus services in any part of Scotland.  Those eligible will need a new or replacement National Entitlement Card (NEC). This means that if a person already has a National Entitlement Card, they must apply for a replacement card. It takes 10 working days from the date an application is approved for the card to arrive. A Young Scot National Entitlement Card (Young Scot NEC) is also permitted for free travel.  People can apply online at www.getyournec.scot. It is also possible to apply in person at a local council office. A recent digital photo is required when applying for the Young Persons’ Free Travel Scheme. A person also needs to provide a photo/scan of their proof of identity in their online application. Proof of address is also required. A parent or guardian can apply for a young person's NEC on their behalf. This is only permitted if the child is aged between five and 15 years old. Those aged between 16 to 21 must apply for a new NEC themselves.  In some local council areas, schools are coordinating applications on behalf of their pupils. Schools will contact parents or guardians and pupils directly if this arrangement is in place. The National Entitlement Card is not accepted on sight seeing bus tours. It is not possible to use a NEC on premium fare night services either.  What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
