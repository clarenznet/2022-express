Max Verstappen went for a trip into the gravel during the first session of Formula One's pre-season testing in Barcelona on Wednesday. Verstappen was getting to grips with his new Red Bull in sunny Spain when he ran wide - though was able to return and did not sustain any damage to his car. The Dutchman completed 80 laps at the Circuit de Catalunya as he enjoyed a productive morning's running between 8am and 12pm. Though as the reigning world champion went full pelt to test out his new machinery, he also had a momentary run off the tarmac and into a gravel trap. He was however the first driver to complete 50 laps and his final 80-lap total was an amount only matched by Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari. Verstappen went on to set the sixth-fastest time of the 10 drivers in the first session. Leclerc set the fastest time of the session with a 1:20.165 while Verstappen's best was a 1:22.246. That was only because he was one of just two drivers on a harder compound of tyre, along with Haas' Nikita Mazepin, with the rest who were on tyres that were a grade softer. Lando Norris was second quickest in the McLaren with George Russell ending third in the timesheets on his first proper day of running for Mercedes. For Red Bull, Sergio Perez will take over for this afternoon's session, which takes place from 1pm to 5pm. Red Bull's RB18 was markedly different to the show car they unveiled at their team's launch event earlier this month. Lewis Hamilton, Verstappen's main rival to the title last year who narrowly missed out in the Abu Dhabi finale, was spotted taking a close look into the Red Bull garage at their car in the morning. And Sky Sports' Ted Kravitz, in the pitlane, reported: "The big story of the morning for me is the first look at the new Red Bull. That is a car that has everything. "I'm as impressed as I've been with any car to see the new Red Bull in the flesh. It's the first time we've seen it. "There's been various spy shots of the shakedown at Silverstone but nothing we could see. "That car has all the bells and whistles on it that we've seen as ideas that have cropped up on an individual form on every other car in the pitlane. "It's got the low nose, it's got the main flap of the front wing that is detached from the nose, it's got the little hole Ferrari have got in the front. It's got the shaped sculpted sidepods of the Mercedes. "It's got all the tricks we're seeing individually on each car up and down the pitlane in one car. It's super impressive to see the design work on that Red Bull. "Maybe because it's we haven't seen it, we've already seen the Mercedes in some detail. The Mercedes looks like every Mercedes there's been for quite a while. The Red Bull is something very, very different." 1) Charles Leclerc, Ferrari, 1m20.165, C3 tyre2) Lando Norris, McLaren, 1m20.474, C3 3) George Russell, Mercedes, 1m20.784, C3 4) Sebastian Vettel, Aston Martin, 1m21.276, C3 5) Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri, 1m21.638, C3 6) Max Verstappen, Red Bull, 1m22.246, C2 7) Fernando Alonso, Alpine, 1m23.317, C3 8) Nicholas Latifi, Williams, 1m23.379, C3 9) Nikita Mazepin, Haas, 1m24.505, C2 10) Robert Kubica, Alfa Romeo, 1m25.909, C3*C1=hardest tyre, C5=softest
