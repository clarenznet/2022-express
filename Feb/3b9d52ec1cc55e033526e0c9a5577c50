NatWest posted full-year operating pre-tax profits of £4billion, compared with a £481million loss a year earlier. The bank, which is still 51 percent owned by the taxpayer, distributed more than £3.8billion of capital to shareholders, including £1.7billion to taxpayers. However, investors seized on the drop in NatWest’s net interest margins, which measure the difference between what banks pay savers and charge borrowers. They narrowed from 2.05 percent in 2020 to 1.76 percent. Alison Rose, chief executive officer, said NatWest “delivered a strong performance in 2021”. NatWest also warned that rising prices would make it harder to cut overheads, and lowered its annual cost-cutting target from four percent to three percent. Expectations are set pretty high for the UK banks heading into their latest reporting season, said Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell. “This helps explain why, despite a return to profit and an otherwise pretty positive update, the NatWest share price fell.” The jump in profits was largely down to releasing provisions put aside in case customers defaulted on their loans, as total income was flat, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Lending levels are currently buoyed by heightened mortgage demand, but that may fade as housing market demand may have peaked, she said. The share buyback “sweetener” will reward shareholders for their patience but has done little to relieve the market, Ms Lund-Yates said. “Investors are expecting even more from banks, thanks to the helpful backdrop of rising interest rates.” Gemma Boothroyd, freetrade analyst, said NatWest is “slowly” getting back on its feet. “Its share price is finally returning to pre-pandemic levels, and investors will welcome today’s 7.5p dividend, well over double last August’s payout, she said.” NatWest chairman Howard Davies denied speculation that he preparing to step down. He said: “Reports of my death have been much exaggerated.”
