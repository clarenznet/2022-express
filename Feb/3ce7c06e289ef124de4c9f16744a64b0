Is it just me, or are the Wordle daily puzzles getting harder? Ever since The New York Times purchased the exclusive rights to Wordle, it feels like the daily puzzles are a little trickier than they used to be. One of the recent puzzles ended a lot of players' streaks, while others have used double letters to really confuse people. If you've been struggling with the recent Wordle puzzles, then there are ways to make it slightly easier. If you're struggling with Wordle, you may have previously enabled hard mode. With hard mode enabled, players are forced to use any yellow and green letters in subsequent guesses. This means you can't use your next guess to rule out a large number of letters. Instead, you have to play the yellow and greens you've already uncovered. To turn off hard mode, simply click the settings icon in the top-right part of the screen. Here you'll be presented with a list of options, including the hard mode setting. If hard mode is switched on, simply click it off, and you'll be able to use more letters in each guess.  As a reminder, the Wordle letter tiles will show up in one of three colours once you make a guess. If the turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The app keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your winning streak. With the popularity of the game soaring - thanks to its celebrity following and competitive element - hundreds of "Wordle apps" have appeared in iPhone and Android.
