Ross, 73, was “delighted” his work was recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours and said his 50-year career had “all been a bit of a privilege”. His honour, presented by the Princess Royal, acknowledged his broadcasting, crime prevention and charity work. Ross is best known for presenting BBC Crimewatch with Dando, 37, who was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, south west London, in April 1999. The mystery assassin has never been caught.   Speaking before yesterday’s investiture, Ross said: “Broadcasting is an honour in itself. It is a fantastic career to have. The charity initiatives flow directly out of that.“The death of my co-presenter, Jill Dando, led to the idea of the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science in honour of her, which is at University College London, one of the best universities in the world, and it is now being copied around the world and, actually, this is its 20th anniversary, so in some ways this is an honour for them too.” Ross began his career reporting on the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He presented Crimewatch for more than twenty years and often ended the show with his catchphrase: “Don’t have nightmares. His other screen credits also include Man Alive, Sixty Minutes, Watchdog and Breakfast Time.
