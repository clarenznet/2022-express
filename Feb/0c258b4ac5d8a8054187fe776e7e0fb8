The First Minister has hinted that she is about to initiate a long-term shift of stricter measures as she insisted the tough measures she had imposed on hospitality and large events over Christmas had worked, despite Scotland having a higher Covid rate than England. To continue the measures, the SNP will have to call on the Treasury to provide more money and they will have to cut spending elsewhere if they want to continue to provide free tests. This comes as all Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and free mass testing will stop from April 1. Speaking ahead of her Covid announcement to MSPs on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon lashed out at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's easing of the rules, calling it "unacceptable." She said she doesn't "agree" with a sudden end to the current testing arrangement and that moving back to normality in Scotland will be on a "phased, careful basis". FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
