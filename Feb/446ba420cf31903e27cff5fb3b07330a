UK residents who are living with a health condition or disability that affects their everyday life could be due extra payments from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Thousands of people could be missing out on this financial help and are being urged to double check to see if they qualify for PIP. Almost three (2.8) million people are claiming PIP according to latest figures from the DWP but thousands are also missing out. Campaigners say people should be checking their benefit entitlement at least every six months, particularly now that many are struggling to meet the cost of living. PIP benefits are not means tested, so it’s worth applying even if someone is still working or has savings in the bank. Applications are considered by an independent healthcare professional and can take up to six months to finalise. READ MORE: TV licence: Which DWP benefits mean you qualify for a free licence? How much PIP someone receives depends on the severity of their illness and how it affects their ability to carry out everyday tasks. It can make a huge difference to someone’s finances and help them pay for additional help, as well as soaring energy bills. Latest figures show that one in three claimants (35 percent) are receiving the highest level of award. This works out at £608 a month or £7,296 a year if someone qualifies for both the daily living and mobility rate.

Meanwhile, the Commission for Social Security has called for a replacement to PIP which could see a shake up to the system. The calls come after the Commission listened to evidence from various stakeholders which found the DWP’s current system is underperforming. It’s proposing a new benefit which will see payments rise from £83.70 to £230.77 a week. The Commission is also calling for a Guaranteed Decent Income, set at 50 percent of the minimum wage.
