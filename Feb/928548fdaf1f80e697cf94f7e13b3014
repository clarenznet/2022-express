Writing on Twitter, the Sky News presenter wrote: "Today's date is a palindrome and an ambigram. Same left to right, right to left and mirrored." While it is correct that today's date is both a palindrome and ambigram, Ms Burley made a blunder by claiming the date was "20022022" when in fact it is "22022022". Eagle-eyed Twitter users mocked the Sky News presenter for her blunder. BBC North American Editor, Jon Sopel, commented: "Not written like that it's not! "Think it's the 22nd." Another Twitter user, Daily Reality, wrote: "Huh? The fact the first two numbers on the left are 20 and 22 on the right should be some sort of a clue that it isn't a palindrome." Colonel C added: "That's not today's date, nor is it a palindrome or an ambigram." A fourth Twitter user, Kerry, said: "It isn't the 20th Kay." With Minoo Osborne saying: "You've got it wrong. "It's 22nd not 20th." READ MORE: 'Makes my blood boil' Kay Burley fumes over dog theft documentary Katerina wrote: "This is literally (or numerically) not the same from right to left... "And as others have pointed out, today is the 22nd." While Helen added: "Erm no look at the numbers." DMC wrote: "Today is the 22nd... finger on the pulse as usual."

A palindrome is a sequence of numbers, words, or phrases that read the same back to front as they do front to back. An ambigram is a word that reads the same right-side-up and upside-down.
