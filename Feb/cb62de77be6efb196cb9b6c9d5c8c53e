Nintendo has just announced some major news which could lead to some old games you may own increasing hugely in value. The House of Mario has today revealed that from March next year gamers will no longer be able to buy titles from the Wii U and 3DS eShop digial marketplace. This is of huge significance to retro gaming collectors as it will mean physical copies of games, after the March 2023 deadline, will be the only way for people who haven't digitially downloaded these titles already to play them. And this could lead to prices of physical Wii U and 3DS games surging in value next year. Announcing the news in a blog post, Nintendo said: "As of late March 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases on Nintendo eShop for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. It will also no longer be possible to download free content, including game demos. Furthermore, as this date draws closer, related services will cease to function. "As of 29 August 2022, it will no longer be possible to use a Nintendo eShop Card to add funds to an account on Nintendo eShop for Wii U or Nintendo 3DS. However, it will still be possible to redeem download codes until late March 2023." While physical Wii U and 3DS games could increase across the board, how much these prices will jump will vary between title. The rarer a game is, and the more in-demand it is, the more valuable it could become in future. It's hard to predict which games could see their value increase the most in the future.
