Giving jaunty names to bog-standard storms dramatises them, although the unintended effect can be comical: my favourite meme this week was an image of a grinning Bruce Forsyth in front of a weather map saying “Nice to see you, to see Eunice!”. I’m making a serious point though. Since the Government and Sage decided the only way they could get us to stay indoors for two years was to scare us to death with a barrage of inaccurate “forecasts” of apocalyptic doom (which never materialised) and nightly press conferences designed to terrify the living daylights out of us, it seems they’ve learned the only way to ensure our obedience is with lashings of Project Fear. So, fairly run-of-the-mill February gale-force winds are trailed as a danger to life, trains all over the country are cancelled and weathermen tell us we must “STAY HOME!” – remind you of another familiar panicky slogan? And, just like Pavlov’s dogs, our stomachs twist and we phone our nearest and dearest to tell them not to go out, because “they” keep saying it’s too dangerous. Yes, I know there were some terrible accidents and a great deal of damage, but we have floods, gales and snowstorms every blinking year. What is happening where you live?

We’ve become like kids addicted to violent video games. It seems we can’t live without the drama – there’s always another horrible fate lurking just around the corner. Where’s the resilience, the strength and the common sense? We’re much better than this. We’re British.
