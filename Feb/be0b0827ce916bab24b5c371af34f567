Been thinking about upgrading your ageing Windows 10 PC? Samsung is hoping that its latest Windows 11-powered laptops will offer enough new features to convince you to make the jump. The Korean technology firm has just announced the release of two new devices which come packed with plenty of upgrades including 5G connectivity, ultra-portable design and an S Pen stylus to help you scribble on the screen without using your finger. The new Galaxy Book Pro2 and Galaxy Book Pro2 360 are both powered by the latest 12th gen processors from Intel which Samsung says will offer reliable performance and improved multi-tasking. You'll also find stunning AMOLED screens, up to 512GB of storage and stereo AKG speakers with Dolby Atmos technology. For those endless video calls that we're all still making right now, there's an improved 1080p FHD webcam and studio mics so you can be heard as well as seen. Clever AI will also block out any annoying background audio making sure your voice is loud and clear. Another nice feature is background and facial enhancements which should help to make you look like a Hollywood star during the Monday morning meeting plus there's face tracking which allows the camera to follow you as wander around the room. If you're worried about security then Samsung hopes to help keep your digital life safe. That's because the Galaxy Book2 Pro series is the first consumer PC line-up meeting Microsoft’s secured-core PC requirements. This tech, which delivers an enhanced level of protection on Windows 11, was previously designed for enterprise PCs in high-security industries such as finance, healthcare and government but now it's available for consumers. One final thing that looks sure to impress is the sleek design with some models measuring 11.2mm thin and weighing in at just 870g. If you want a powerful PC with 5G connectivity then the standard Galaxy Book Pro2 will be the one to watch out for. However, those needing a tablet with an S Pen and the ability to transform it into a tablet might fancy the 2-in-1 Galaxy Book Pro2 360. “As consumers continue to use more devices in their homes and offices, the mobile-first generation expects the next level from their PC experience to meet the demands across all aspects of this hybrid living era,” said James Kitto, Vice President of Sales, Samsung Electronics UK and Ireland. “As part of this pursuit, we have reimagined the PC to unlock the possibilities for the ‘office’ of tomorrow and fundamentally enhance the everyday lives of our users. Together with seamless continuity across our Galaxy devices, secure mobility and a leading smartphone experience, consumers can enjoy a new breed of thinner and lighter PCs ready for the new hybrid world, so customers can work, watch and create, however, wherever and whenever they want.” Samsung says that the Galaxy Book2 Pro Series will be available to pre-order on 18th March 2022 before going on wider sale on 01 April 2022 in major UK retailers. From 18th March customers who pre-order any of the Galaxy Book2 Pro, Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 or Galaxy Book2 360 can claim a free pair of Galaxy Buds Pro and Multiport adapter worth £300.
