Sharon Stone, 63, wowed in a plunging back trouser suit for the event. The blazer made sure to draw in at the actresses petite waist, with the collar featuring diamond gem detailing. The gems also featured on the side of her fitted black trousers. She styled the suit with metallic stiletto heels, a black bag with a gold strap and bold black sunglasses. The stunner rounded off the look with gold hoop earrings and a subtle red lip. Her short blonde locks were worn in a tousled look, making sure not to take attention away from her outfit. Sharon mingled with the likes of Sam Webb and Adam Senn as she took front row to watch the fashion show. The actresses trip comes as it was revealed she would be starring in an adaptation of Lisa Barr's soon-to-be-published novel Woman on Fire. Her participation in the upcoming film was revealed by Deadline, who also noted that she would serve as a producer on the film also. The film will be centered on a journalist who becomes embroiled in a scandal related to a Nazi-looted art piece.
