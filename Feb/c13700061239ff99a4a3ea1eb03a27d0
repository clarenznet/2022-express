PC Thomas Hall had been boozing at a pub after a visit to the theme park when he took a "distressed" woman back to her hotel. He admitted he "cuddled" and "spooned" her after getting into her bed. At a police misconduct hearing at Kent Police HQ in Northfleet, the victim said: "After we had gone to bed, I woke up to PC Hall running his hands over me and touching my breasts." She said Hall moved his hand into her underwear without her consent but was afraid to make a complaint later. Hall denied the claim, calling it a made-up "dream", but the panel backed the woman's version of events on a balance of probabilities and said he lacked remorse. They ruled it gross misconduct, warranting his dismissal without notice.
