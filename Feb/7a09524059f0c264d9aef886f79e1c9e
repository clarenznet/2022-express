The IT reprisals are expected “within five to 10 days”, following the imposition of major sanctions by the West last week.

Last night experts said Washington and Whitehall would also choose to mount retaliatory cyber attacks in an attempt to hinder Russian forces in Ukraine.

Cyber analyst Hans Horan said that, for both sides, attacks would begin gradually. “When it comes to British targets, Russia’s state-sponsored hackers will begin by targeting niche defence firms as well as the energy and telecoms sector,” he said. “The effects will be felt slowly at first. If we get into a tit-for-tat cyber conflict, however, Russia may go from disruptive to destructive tactics.” Ukraine has already successfully mounted cyber strikes of its own against Russia, and last night asked for help from South Korea in strengthening its posture. And US President Joe Biden has reportedly been presented with an array of options to mount an offensive on a “scale never before contemplated”. These range from disrupting internet connectivity and electricity across Russia, and tampering with railway switches to hamper its ability to replenish its forces.
