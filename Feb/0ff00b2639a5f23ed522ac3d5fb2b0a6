We have come a long way since then thanks to investment in our defences, the public’s huge sacrifices and the tireless work of our scientists. We now have life-saving vaccines and antivirals to help protect people from severe COVID-19 and hospitalisation. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows shortly after getting a booster, you are at least 85% less likely to end up in hospital than if you are unvaccinated. With our improved understanding, we can move away from government intervention to personal responsibility and learn to live with COVID-19. The public’s response has been phenomenal – we were the first major European country to provide boosters to 50% of the population. More than 38 million people have now had a booster or a third jab, and 85% of the population have had two doses. It’s because of these efforts that from Thursday February 24, people are no longer legally required to self-isolate if they test positive. Where possible, people are still advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others. The government will continue to support the most vulnerable. From spring, we will offer an additional COVID-19 booster jab to people aged 75 years and over, residents in care homes, and people aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed. It’s because of these efforts that from Thursday February 24, people are no longer legally required to self-isolate if they test positive. Where possible, people are still advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others. The NHS will keep vaccinating and offering treatments, supporting those with long COVID, and testing patients. This week marks a new chapter in our history as we remove COVID-19 restrictions to make England a free nation once again. COVID-19 will not suddenly disappear and we must continue to protect ourselves. Vaccines are our best defence – if you haven’t already, Get Boosted Now.
