In both the Commons and at a private meeting of Tory MPs last night, his colleagues made clear they expect him to smarten up his act and heed the views of the party rank and file. Yet the threat of a leadership challenge that many predicted would follow the publication of Sue Gray's report did not appear to be crystallising. "MPs are pulling back from the brink. Talk of a leadership election has filled people with horror," said one Tory backbencher last night. While only Graham Brady ‑ chairman of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers ‑ knows how close rebels are to the 54 signatures needed to trigger a confidence vote, the Prime Minister's allies are confident the moment of maximum peril has passed. Labour's shrinking lead in the opinion polls has convinced many Tory MPs that now is not the time for a change at the top of the party, his supporters say. Mr Johnson suffered some stinging criticism from his own side in the Commons. But his supporters are convinced the attacks are limited to his long-term foes and not a sign of a growing rebellion. MPs say he was buoyant at a meeting of backbenchers. "He was brilliant. The mood was very positive," said one. Tory backbenchers have put him on notice that he needs to change while ensuring he still has the chance to do so. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
