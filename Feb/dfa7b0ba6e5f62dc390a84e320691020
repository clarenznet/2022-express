Mr Putin strayed over the Russian border last night, following what he called a "peacemaking" exercise after recognising the rebel-held regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The move earned him swift condemnation and came just hours after the Russian premier questioned Ukraine's sovereignty in a near hour-long televised address. The Prime Minister joined other western nations in condemning his movements this morning, and announced a COBRA meeting to deliberate on how Britain would react. Mr Johnson joined his US and EU counterparts this afternoon in greenlighting a first round of sanctions. They target Russia's economy by punishing Russian interests currently resident in the UK. Russian banks and plutocrats will feel the burn of Mr Putin's actions first.
