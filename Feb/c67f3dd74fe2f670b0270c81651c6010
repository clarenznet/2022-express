Nicola Sturgeon is set to unveil her government’s plans for living with COVID-19 in Scotland in a statement to be published this week. However, Scottish TV presenter Neil Oliver blasted the First Minister’s Covid strategy, which has been much stricter than Boris Johnson’s approach and has seen Scotland introduce a vaccine passport scheme.  Mr Oliver said: “Nicola Sturgeon has been incompetent, the SNP administration has been disatrously incompetent. “I’m not even sure incompetent is a big enough word for it. “They are not fit to govern.” He claimed that the SNP and Ms Sturgeon will be able to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse for their failings in government.  Mr Oliver added: “A disaster that might not otherwise have come has descended upon the world and Scotland being that part of it, and her devolved administration being in control when that happened. “And now her incompetence of a decade and more, otherwise laid bare by bright light, is now something that she can say, ‘well this was caused by Covid’. “‘This was not my fault’, and that’s not the case, it has been and is her fault. “And now she seeks and has sought to use Covid as the get out clause that says, ‘well, that wasn’t my doing’.

She acknowledged that people would be optimistic about getting back to normal, but that the pandemic was still not over and that it was important to remain vigilant and be aware that new variants could develop.
