People can get 60 percent tax relief if their adjusted net income is between £100,000 and £125,140. Adjusted net income is one’s total taxable income before any personal allowances and net of certain tax reliefs.These tax reliefs include trading loses, charitable donations made through gift aid, pension contributions paid before tax relief and pension contributions where someone’s pension provider has already given you tax relief at the basic rate. Making additional pension contributions as people approach the end of the tax year when they may have more clarity about their exact income can be a “great way” to maximise the use of income tax allowances and exemptions. On his YouTube channel, certified financial planner Justin King discussed how people earning within this bracket can receive this 60 percent tax relief and offered insight for those who are thinking about making additional pension contributions. He said: “It’s even better if you know what your adjusted net income is going to be at the start of the tax year on the April 6 so you can plan ahead and take advantage of this legitimate tax break. “The reason some people are able to get 60 percent tax relief on their pension contributions is due to the reduction in the personal allowance that is made once your adjusted net income exceeds £100,000.” READ MORE: 'Thievery at highest order!'

Mr King continued: “Anything you can do to reduce your income, so that your personal allowance is not reduced in whole or in part - for example by making a pension contribution - will in effect generate 60 percent tax relief. “It will generate 60 percent because pension contributions generate 40 percent tax relief initially as income at that level is subject to tax – so contributions receive 40 percent tax relief. “But in addition, contributions will reduce your adjusted net income and you will recover your personal allowance effectively giving you a further 20 percent tax relief.” He gave an example. If someone earns £125,140 - the top end of the income bracket – then at this level, they have lost their personal allowance, so they can’t earn any money free from income tax. He explained that they will pay basic rate income tax of 20 percent on £37,000 of their salary which equates to £7,540. They will then pay 40 percent on the rest of their salary. That’s another £34,976. The total income tax paid is £42,560. If people then make gross pension contributions of £25,140, this will reduce their gross salary back down to £100,000. They will then get back their personal allowance – so they can earn £12,570 free of income tax. Britons will still pay basic rate tax of 20 percent on the £37,700 which gives the same figure of £7,540, but they will then pay 40 percent income tax on a much smaller amount of their gross salary - £49,740 instead of £87,440. This will give a total income tax bill of £27,432. Mr King concluded: “Without a pension contribution, you will pay £42,516 in income tax, but making a pension contribution can reduce your tax bill to £27,432. “That’s a reduction of £15,084 in the income tax paid which as a percentage of your pension contributions is 60 percent. “This is how to get 60 percent tax relief on pension contributions if your adjusted net income is between £100,000 and £125,140.”
