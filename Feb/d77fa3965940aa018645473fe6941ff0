Last night, US President Biden and Boris Johnson spoke, agreeing that there remained a window for diplomacy. But they warned President Putin that further movement into Ukraine would wreak havoc on Russia through crippling sanctions. These could include blocking Russian banks from financial markets and capital. The point is to deter conflict.War would be horrific, especially in this time of pandemic recovery. But the Russian President has played a reckless hand, with well over 100,000 troops encircling Ukraine and he takes a threatening stance. Boris Johnson is to tour Europe to discuss a common strategy and unite the Western response. He and President Biden reiterated the need for European countries to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, which would also hurt Putin. Let us be in no doubt.Whatever Russia's politicians may claim, it is they, not Nato, who are the aggressors. Ukraine, a sovereign state, has every right to defend itself and to ask neighbours for assistance. It is time for the rest of the world to ensure a common response, and show President Putin that his bellicose stance will backfire. ----------------- THERE won't be a "year zero" moment with Covid, when we suddenly wake up and the virus no longer exists.
