However there are some allowances that could save Britons a fortune - getting it wrong could mean Britons are slapped with a 40 percent inheritance tax bill. These are the HM Revenues and Customs (HMRC) thresholds, rules and allowances for 2022. When it comes to inheritance tax (IHT), even experts agree that it’s a tricky subject with thousands of people getting it wrong every year. It certainly pays to brush up on the rules, thresholds and allowances as collectively the nation gave away £125million in “unnecessary” IHT in 2020. Most people’s biggest asset is their property and they can give this to a partner, spouse or charity no matter what the value without being subject to IHT. However, leave it to anyone else and there could be a tax bill to pay.

However, this rises to £500,000 if given to children, grandchildren or stepchildren. For people who are married or in a civil partnership whose estate is worth less than their threshold, any unused threshold can be added to their partner’s threshold when they die. This means their threshold could be as much as £1million.

Yet there are other rules and exemptions that can be used to help people pass on more of their hard earned cash to family members rather than HMRC. Firstly, Britons can choose to give gifts seven years before they die which would be classed as Potentially Exempt Transfers. It’s also advisable that they make the most of cash allowances - people can gift up to £3,000 per tax year as well as small gifts of £250 or less. As spring approaches it’s also worth bearing in mind that taxpayers can give wedding and civil partnership gifts up to £5,000 without them being subject to IHT. They can also carry over an allowance from a previous year if it’s not been used already. For example, a parent could gift their child up to £11,000 tax free in one year - a £5,000 gift made in consideration of marriage plus this year’s £3,000 annual exemption and last year’s if it hasn’t been used already.
