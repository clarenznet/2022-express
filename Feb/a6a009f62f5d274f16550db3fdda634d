The emaciated body of Debbie Leitch, 24, was found at her family home in Blackpool. Preston Crown Court heard "she was no longer recognisable as being a young female".The cause of death was severe emaciation and neglect with extensive scabies infection. Debbie's mother Elaine Clarke - who received Â£215 weekly benefits to care for her - admitted gross negligence manslaughter. Mrs Justice Yip said yesterday Debbie's condition "deteriorated dramatically" in her last months. She told Clarke, 49: "Nothing was done to halt her decline. Debbie was starved, her scabies was allowed to run out of control. "Anyone entering her room could have been left with no doubt that her life was in real danger. You ignored that risk and left Debbie to die in her squalid room." Debbie weighed just 3st 10lb when she died. John Harrison QC, prosecuting, had said she was dependent on mum-of-four Clarke. Each child had learning or physical difficulties and the family was wellknown to social services over concerns about her parenting skills. In 2014 the family moved from Hastings to Leeds to live with Clarke's boyfriend Robert Bruce.  Debbie was described by a support worker as "cheeky and willing to give anything a go". In 2018 she had Norwegian scabies, a condition associated with neglect after her family moved again, to Blackpool. Relatives who feared Debbie was dying contacted social services the following year but Clarke showered her daughter - and a doctor who visited said there were no concerns. Debbie's body was found on August 29 after neighbours heard a young female crying "Mummy". Mrs Justice Yip jailed Clarke for nine years and seven months, saying: "Your own inadequacies and difficult upbringing may go some way to explaining a general lack of parenting skills. It is hard, though, to escape the conclusion that you simply abandoned Debbie." A safeguarding review of the case is taking place.
