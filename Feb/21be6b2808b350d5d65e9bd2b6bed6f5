The Russian driver spoke after the first morning testing from the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. In a video, a Sky Sports reporter asked the racer about the situation in his home country. They could be heard asking the star: "As an athlete competing at the highest level you know what's going on in the world at the moment and obviously it involves Russia. "Is it easy to keep your mind focused on matters of the track or is part of your mind on what's going on back home?" The F1 driver was quick to relay his stance on the matter, revealing that he isn't affected by it. Mazepin replied: "Well, I'm not struggling at all because I've always been a big supporter of sports without politics and today I'm in Barcelona." Having brushed over the political situation, he quickly moved on to the subject of the new car he is driving. DON'T MISS...

"So, I'm just very happy to be in Barcelona and I hope these three days are longer because it's a nice experience." The reporter went on to ask Mazepin whether he's hopeful that the Russian Grand Prix will continue as planned in September. He said: "The race itself in Russia, are you still hopeful that it will go ahead?" Responding, Mazepin said: "Of course, from the understanding that we've had with Formula One, the race is going ahead and you will surely see me there," he smiled, before the clip ended. Haas, who Mazepin is currently racing for, released a statement after dropping Russian sponsor Uralkali's logo from their F1 car in Barcelona. They opted to run an all-white car on the last day of testing after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which left 137 dead and more than 316 injured after the first day of conflict. Mazepin, son of major Uralkali shareholder Dmitry, has been confirmed by Haas to be driving as planned in the morning session today.
