The questionnaire given to the PM and his aides by detectives probing the gatherings during lockdown was leaked last night. Obtained by ITV News it is effectively the written equivalent of a police interview under caution. Mr Johnson is believed to be the first serving prime minister subject to that level of police questioning. Questions include, "Did you participate in a gathering on a specific date?" and "What was the purpose of your participation in that gathering?" Respondents have a chance to justify their actions and they can also decline to answer the questions.
