The first Platinum Jubilee for any British monarch represents a period in history which will forever be known as the Second Elizabethan Era. When she ascended to the throne Winston Churchill was prime minister, rationing was still a reality and hardly any homes had a television set. The remarkable change which she herself has reflected on in her message to the nation is truly profound. We have a biographer of Churchill as Prime Minister, the choice of food in supermarkets keeps growing and most homes have a computer. While there are many things which drive positive change and wider progress we must not underestimate the role of Her Majesty. The stability she has provided over seven decades to the nation has given us a platform on which to transform and reshape ourselves collectively. It says much about the quiet humility but firm leadership of our world-respected and much-loved head of state that even at the age of 95 she has once again dedicated herself to service to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and signed her message "your servant". We are truly blessed as a country to continue to have Elizabeth II as our monarch and the words of the anthem "God save our gracious Queen, long live our noble Queen" are as true today as they were 70 years ago. The deal that Boris Johnson has done with his Conservative backbenchers is certainly one which should be welcomed. It was clear that many people felt he had been allowed to drift away from the principles which had got him elected with such a resounding majority in 2019. The refreshing of his Government includes a clearout of his staff and bringing in new people. He is also focusing on Levelling Up, streamlining government, tackling woke cancel culture and cutting taxes, all of which are positive moves. What is happening where you live?
