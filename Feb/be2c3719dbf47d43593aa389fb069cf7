Café 52, run by Steven Bothwell, said it wanted to fill vacancies "urgently" in the ad, which was posted to the job site Indeed. It stated those wearing "face masks and lazy b******s" should not apply for the roles in Aberdeen, Scotland. The full advert reads: "Cafe 52 is 27 years old this year and we would like REAL people to join our superb, dedicated, hard-working team. "Café 52 is THE most honest, upfront, no b******t restaurant in Aberdeen, serving high quality innovative dishes celebrating the seasons. "Much of the produce is home grown and the owners Mum, Mrs B serves up the puddings which are wonderful. "The owner cannot stand preciousness, virtue signalling, mask wearing, Guardian readers, liars, lazy b******s and self testers. "Hospitality is a wonderful industry but only when staff pull together and leave their ego's in their lockers. "Ready to rock and roll when you are." The position offered between £9 and £10 an hour, reports Aberdeen Live.  The job also advertised the role as offering full-time, part-time and permanent work, with part-time hours of between 30-45 hours per week. The advert has been changed following a torrent of criticism. It now doesn't include any profanities or references to "virtue signalling, mask wearing" individuals. But during the COVID-19 lockdowns, the establishment drew further criticism on social media for jibes about the government. A post in December 2021 said: “We refuse point blank to be b*********d [sic] by a bunch of lying ***** who have made life hell for so many people. "We don't dictate to our customers and we don't plaster the walls with brainwashing propaganda."
