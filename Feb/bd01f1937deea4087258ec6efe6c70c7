Andy Murray has crashed out of the Dubai Duty Free Tenis Championships after suffering a straight-sets loss to Jannik Sinner. The world No 10 needed just one hour and 44 minutes to dispatch the former champion 7-5 6-2. Murray was playing in Dubai for the first time since 2017, when he won the event as the then-world No 1. Murray and Sinner had faced off once before at the end of last season. In the Brit’s final tournament of 2021, he nabbed his second top-ten win of the year when he defeated the Italian 7-6(4) 6-3 at the Stockholm Open. Both players were forced to battle from a set down in their opening matches, with Murray defeating Aussie qualifier Christopher O’Connell 6-7(4) 6-3 7-5 while fourth seed Sinner overcame Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 4-6 7-6(6) 6-3. Murray and Sinner were neck-and-neck throughout most of the first set, with the current world No 89 able to fend off two break points at 2-2.

The world No 10 continued his momentum into the second set, breaking Murray in the very first game. Murray was finally able to stop the Italian’s run of games when he saved another break point at 0-2 to get himself on the scoreboard in the second. The match started to get away from him at 1-3, when Sinner converted his fourth break point after a lengthy five-deuce game, causing Murray to smash his racket on the court.

It means Murray is denied his goal of a 700th career match win. The three-time Major champion admitted that he had small goals to work towards during the back-end of the 2021 season – reaching 700 career victories and 50 titles, currently holding 46. His first-round win over O’Connell marked his 699th but he will now have to wait until next month’s Masters 1000 in Indian Wells to attempt to get to 700. Murray had been making first appearance in Dubai in five years. The last time he competed in the event back in 2017 he was the world No 1 and defeated Roberto Bautista Agut in the final to lift the trophy. He is still set to rise up the rankings after his round two showing at the ATP 500 event. The former No 1 currently sits at No 82 in the provisional live rankings, seven spots higher than his current position.
