Arsenal have been heavily linked with a move for Real Sociedad striker Alexander Isak since the beginning of the recent January transfer window. The 22-year-old is said to be high on Mikel Arteta's list of targets ahead of next season as the Spaniard looks to revamp his attacking options in time for the upcoming campaign. The likes of Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are widely expected to leave Arsenal when their current deals expire in the summer.Meanwhile, the Gunners have already lost the services of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who joined Barcelona on a permanent deal at the end of last month.The situation could potentially leave Folarin Balogun as the club's only contracted striker unless Arteta is able to make at least one new signing when the transfer window re-opens at the end of the season.Isak was reportedly targeted by Arsenal in January but never ended up joining the club despite being spotted in London during the final stages of the window.The Swedish marksman has since been linked with a fresh move to the Emirates Stadium ahead of next season, but it seems as though Arsenal could face stiff competition from Barcelona in the race for his signature. JUST IN: Man Utd ‘convinced’ over Declan Rice and Harry Kane transfer plan The Catalan giants will chase a move for Isak if they fail in their efforts to land Borussia Dortmund talisman Erling Haaland, according to Sport.However, Isak has already underlined his desire to try his luck in the Premier League by insisting that he was tempted by the lure of English football when quizzed on the matter back in November."One day it would be nice to play in England as well," Isak told The Independent."They have six or seven of the biggest clubs in the world, it’s a very high level, and of course one day it would be an alternative. "Every player wants to be the best version of themselves and reach the highest possible level."I have expectations for myself that I’m trying to fulfil, so we’ll see where the journey takes me in future."It remains to be seen whether Arsenal will eventually firm up their interest in Isak with an official bid when the transfer market re-opens at the end of the season.He is said to have a release clause in the region of £75million that was written into the long-term deal he signed at Real Sociedad last year.

Obviously, he’ll have to develop and learn, but he’s perfect, exactly what Arsenal need." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport?
