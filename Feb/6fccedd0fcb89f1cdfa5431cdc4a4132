The Scottish First Minister told MSPs this would happen assuming there were "no significant adverse developments" with the virus. The legal requirement to wear masks in some settings will be dropped from March 21, but the government will still "strongly recommend" face coverings be worn - and will also continue to ask people to self-isolate if they test positive. Isolation is "one of the most fundamental public health protections we have available to us", the First Minister said. While the passport scheme, which required Scots to show their vaccination status before entering a nightclub or attending a large event, is to end Monday, the app for the scheme will remain operational so businesses can use it on a "voluntary basis to reassure customers", she said.  Ms Sturgeon comments came the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Covid laws in England are to end on Thursday. She has since been seeking clarity from the Treasury about whether Scotland might retain funding for free lateral flow tests, unlike England - saying they "should remain free of charge for any circumstance in which government recommends testing". The latest daily figures showed Scotland had recorded 6,427 new cases of the virus, as well as 18 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some 1,060 people are in hospital with 25 in ICU.
