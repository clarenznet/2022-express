Manchester United could reap the rewards of snubbing a move for Harry Kane in favour of Bayern Munich talisman Robert Lewandowski when the transfer window re-opens at the end of the campaign. The Red Devils have been linked with both players ahead of next season as they weigh up a move for a new first-choice forward to replace Edinson Cavani at Old Trafford. The Uruguayan marksman will be out of contract in the summer as things stand and is not expected to sign a new deal between now and the end of the season.Meanwhile, there are also questions over the immediate future of Cristiano Ronaldo, who is said to be open to the idea of leaving United if they miss out on a top-four finish in the Premier League over the coming months.The 37-year-old was visibly frustrated after United's home draw with Watford on Saturday and is said to have doubts over the ability of Ralf Rangnick as he looks to secure Champions League qualification ahead of next season.It seems as though United will be looking to recruit at least one new striker in the summer window if Cavani is allowed to leave as expected or Ronaldo opts to seek a fresh challenge elsewhere.They have recently been credited with a desire to sign Kane, who tried to leave Tottenham last summer but was denied a big-money move to Manchester City.

He is said to be keen on the idea of signing a new deal and appears to be growing frustrated with the reluctance of his employers to put the wheels in motion.Bayern director Hasan Salihamidzic has already insisted that he will do everything it takes to extend Lewandowski's contract, but the player himself seems to be unsure over the club's true intentions."I'm hearing that for the first time," he told reporters after being informed of Salihamidzic's comments earlier this month.It remains to be seen whether Bayern will look to sell Lewandowski in the summer or if they will decide to retain their key man for at least another year.
