With the weather in the UK as gloomy as ever and summer seeming excruciatingly far away, many residents are looking at booking in a little weekend away in Europe to tide them over until the summer holidays. Travelzoo has a deal that is helping holiday planners do just that while scoring some major savings. Tuscany, Copenhagen, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, and Krakow are all included in the deal, with prices starting at just £99 for the weekend - which works out to be as low as £25 per person, per night. This deal is a special exclusive just for Express readers, as part of a new partnership with Travelzoo that’s saving readers money on their next getaway. All of these deals are fully refundable, so you’ll also have peace of mind. This is especially important for those who are nervous to travel because of possible restrictions or have been burned from losing money on a non-refundable trip in the past. As an example of how much money you can save by booking one of these trips, booking a stay in Copenhagen directly would cost up to £259. But if you take advantage of this Travelzoo offer, you can snap it up for just £99 - saving you £160. The deal has six options, including: Two-night stay in a villa near Pisa, Tuscany - Up to 54% off (£70) Two-night stay near city centre, Copenhagen - Up to 62% off (£99) Two-night stay at deluxe hotel in Vienna - Up to 65% off (£99) Two-night city centre stay in Prague - Up to 51% off (£99) Two-night stay at ‘luxurious’ hotel in Budapest - (£115) Two-night stay in a new deluxe adults-only hotel in central Krakow - (£99) You can take a look at all of the deals on Travelzoo here.
