Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen spoke with Boris Johnson via a phone call. The monarch, who is triple vaccinated, tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday and continues to have mild symptoms. The 95-year-old has been following Covid guidelines and is isolating at Windsor Castle. In the past few days, a number of palace staff who work and care for the Queen are understood to have also tested positive. Concerns over Her Majestyâ€™s health have heightened due to her age and other recent health scares. Last October, the Queen had an overnight stay in hospital to undergo tests and, the following month, she suffered a back sprain. The Palace has insisted that the Queen will continue to undertake light duties from her desk. However, she had to cancel two engagements, via video link, on Tuesday due to feeling unwell. In keeping with the current guidelines, the Queen would be freed from quarantine from today. What is happening where you live?
