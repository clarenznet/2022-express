Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is weighing up a move for Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez to serve as Roberto Firmino's eventual replacement at Anfield, according to reports. The Reds have long been linked with the addition of a new central striker in order to boost their array of options at the top of the pitch. The likes of Firmino and Diogo Jota have served the club well in recent years, with the latter having emerged as one of Liverpool's most important players since the beginning of the current campaign.However, the idea of a revamp has often been touted to replace the ageing trio of Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah in attack over the coming years.Liverpool have already moved to improve their ranks ahead of next season with the addition of Luis Diaz, who made the switch to Merseyside from Porto at the end of the January transfer window.It seems likely that one or two additional signings could be made when the market re-opens in the summer as Klopp looks to prepare for a renewed Premier League title challenge at the next time of asking.Martinez is among the names on Liverpool's shortlist and could be sold by Inter in an attempt to balance the books at the San Siro, according to Calciomercato.

Martinez only signed a long-term extension to his Inter deal in October but it is said that his exit could still take place over the coming months in spite of his new agreement, which is set to run until the summer of 2025.It remains to be seen whether Liverpool will be able to force Inter's hand with a sizeable bid for the Argentine forward during the summer months.Klopp is understood to be a keen admirer of Martinez and spoke highly of the Inter marksman after the Italian giants were drawn against Liverpool in the Champions League knockout stages back in December."Lautaro Martinez is one of the most exciting strikers in the world, probably, it’s a proper Champions League tie and I am absolutely looking forward to it," the Reds boss told reporters.
