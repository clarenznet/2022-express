Astonishing footage has emerged of brave Ukrainians from the embattled city of Chernihiv appearing to launch an un-armed defence in front of storming Russian troops on the third day of Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the footage, brave citizens from the northern Ukraine city can be seen rushing to block the path of a line of Russian tanks. One man appears so determined to stop them that he throws himself onto a moving tank. The tank then appears to speed off as he struggles to hold onto the tanks main canon.

Triggering the war, Russian President gave the orders for the dawn onslaught as he embarked on his mission of "de-militarisation" and "de-Nazification" of Ukraine, both totally false claims. Heavy bombardments rained down on Kyiv and the country's second-largest city of Kharkiv, alongside other locations. Following the aerial bombardments, troops poured in from the north, east, and south as the scale of the attack was realised but Ukrainian troops fought back and said they had inflicted heavy casualties on the Russians.

On Friday Ukraine's Government said over 18,000 guns had been handed to civilians as they remove an age limit to call on anyone of any age to come forward and take up arms to defend Ukraine from the Russian onslaught. Overnight fighting has exploded in the capital Kyiv as Russian forces entered the city as President Putin aims to force a regime change and install a puppet Government. But experts suggest the opening days of invasion have not gone to plan, as many fear the war will spiral into an insurgency, with potentially millions of Ukranians fighting off Russia.
