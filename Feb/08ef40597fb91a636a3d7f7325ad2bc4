The original Uptown Girl is angry at how older women's careers are often cancelled by Hollywood's desire for younger faces. Four-times married Christie, 68, said: "We are constantly being categorised because of our age. "Stereotypes and rules that our culture has defined for us abound. "Even the expression 'ageing gracefully' should not be about one's looks but about the attitude and energy one offers the world." The mother of three added: "Looking good is a by-product of feeling great and showing up in the world with a heart full of good intentions and good energy. "The subtle constant categorising of women by age, making us feel like we are approaching some exponential expiration date, gnaws away at one's confidence." Christie, who featured in the video for second husband Billy Joel's 1983 hit Uptown Girl, posted images of herself under the hashtag "68feelinggreat". She insisted: "If you've got great legs, show them. If there's something about yourself that you really love, celebrate that. Don't be controlled by those numbers."
