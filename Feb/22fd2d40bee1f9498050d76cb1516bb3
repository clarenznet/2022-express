The Prime Minister will chair the emergency committee after President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour overnight. Almost 200,000 troops have been situated on Ukraine's borders for weeks, with the Russian President ordering strikes on Ukraine's military infrastructure in the early hours of the morning. Moscow's attacks come despite warnings from the West that a coordinated response would be unleashed on the Kremlin if it took action against Kiev. Sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy have already been drawn up to be introduced by the UK along with the US and EU. The UK announced a "first barrage" of measures against Moscow on Monday after it recognised the rebel-held regions of eastern Ukraine as breakaway republics. Five Russian banks had their assets frozen, while three Russian billionaires - including a close personal friend of President Putin - were also targeted.
