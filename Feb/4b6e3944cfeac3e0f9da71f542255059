Metropolitan Police said the man, in his 20s, had been taken to hospital by the time officers attended the scene. The force was called to Wedmore Avenue in Clayhall at 3.45pm today (Monday).  A spokesperson for the Met said there had been no arrests and enquiries were ongoing. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Met Police on 101 or tweet @MetCC and quote CAD4408/21Feb. Wedmore Avenue sits between Woodford and Fairlop, in Ilford. The sad news comes amid criticism of Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, for failing to tackle stabbings and violence in the capital, after last year saw a sharp rise in knife crime.    Susan Hall, the Chair of the Police and Crime panel at the Greater London Assembly, recently said: “Sadiq Khan is a weak leader. “He makes sure that when there is mud being thrown, none of it sticks to him. “Whether it is knife crime, stop and search or problems in the Met, it is always someone else’s fault and rather than get involved and try to resolve the issues he makes sure someone else carries the can.” Meanwhile, Gordon Rayner, Associate Editor at the Telegraph, said last week that London has become "a far more dangerous place" since the mayor had taken over.   In December, Mr Khan announced that an additional £50million in funding would be reserved to tackle crime across the capital. And earlier this month, he pledged that every child living in crisis will have access to a personal mentor by 2024. Mr Khan said at the time that the scheme will "help prevent vulnerable young Londoners from being exploited or sucked into gangs and violence".
