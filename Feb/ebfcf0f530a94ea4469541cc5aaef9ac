Mikel Arteta appeared to taunt the Wolves bench at full-time after his Arsenal side secured a last-gasp comeback win over their top-four rivals. The Gunners took - what felt like - a big step towards Champions League qualification as Alexandre Lacazette's 95th-minute winner sparked pandemonium at the Emirates Stadium. Wolves looked on course to grind out a 1-0 victory before two Arteta substitutions swung the balance of the contest. Nicolas Pepe levelled things up while Eddie Nketiah helped provide an extra attacking threat in the final third. Arsenal had been left frustrated by Wolves' time-wasting during the clash as the visitors tried to protect their lead. First right-back Nelson Semedo went down injured and while he was legitimately carrying a problem it took Wolves three minutes to make a substitution.

Raul Jimenez was leaving the field before Wolves decided to keep him on the pitch, instead withdrawing goalscorer Hwang Hee-chan. There was later further unrest as Daniel Podence took his time to leave the field when he was subbed for Leander Dendoncker in the 90th minute. Arteta and his bench became increasingly riled by the antics as they went in search of a winner and when they did eventually find one, there was bedlam on the sidelines and in the stands.

"My plan was to manage the game in a different way," said Lage, who apologised to Arteta. "I had already had that situation with Nelson (Semedo) and I wanted to put Fabio (Silva) on for Raul and Leander for Podence to close the game. "It was a lack of communication between me and my staff and the fourth official, that's why I talked with the referee and apologised. It was my fault. "I went to the Arsenal bench and said the same thing to Arteta, 'Sorry about that', because in my mind I never did that to waste time."
