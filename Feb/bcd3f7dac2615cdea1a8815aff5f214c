The American guitarist and his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, played at the Bath Pavilion on February 20, 1967. They were standing in for Chuck Berry, who had cancelled. Before the show two local girls, aged 15 and 16, went to the backstage door for an autograph. Hendrix stepped out to meet them but said he had no blank paper, so he tore out a page of an p exercise book, ripped it in half and signed both pieces. Fellow band members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding also gave their signatures. What is happening where you live?
