John Bancroft manipulated seven girls into performing obscene sex acts and sometimes gave them money in a "sugar daddy" arrangement - between 2016 and 2017. The 68-year-old also worked for both Unite and Unison, which the judge said gave him a "platform" to "use and target" the victims. Bancroft was also as an extra on Netflix series The Crown, according to the CPS.Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the girls, who were aged between 15 and 17 at the time, were picked as they had complicated relationships with their parents or struggled with eating disorders or self harming.Three of the victims came to court for the sentencing hearing this week, and were commended by the judge for their “tremendous courage and fortitude” and “detailed accounts” that helped convict Bancroft of a catalogue of 34 offences.The girls wrote statements to describe the extreme physical and emotional pain they suffered at Bancroft’s hands, with several saying they have since tried to take their own lives.Bancroft admitted five counts of paying for the sexual services of a child, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, attempted sexual communication with a child, nine counts of attempted causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, as well as seven counts of taking indecent images and six counts of distributing indecent images of children. He was convicted of four counts of rape and meeting a child following sexual grooming after trial and, this week, was jailed for 22 years. The judge ruled Bancroft, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, posed a “serious risk to the public”.His brother Graham Manicom, 62, admitted joining him on two occasions to have paid group sex with two of the victims.Manicom, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, admitted two counts of paying for the sexual services of a child two weeks into a trial and was jailed for three-and-a-half years.Sentencing Bancroft, Judge Oscar Del Fabbro said: “You were persistent in your pursuit of these teenage girls.“During the course of some of these sex acts you fantasized about what can only be described as sado-masochistic acts - all for your own gratification.“Your predilection for sexual gratification through the pursuit of vulnerable young females suggests an insatiable appetite for such encounters."You are able to use social media to manipulate these victims psychologically in what appears to be a well practised and well rehearsed role.”One of the women said in her statement: “That part of my life is quite grey and cloudy. It felt nice to talk to someone who seemed to care, and John Bancroft took an interest in me."I was shocked someone would respond to my self harming like that, and I liked that he cared I had done that to myself."He was very violent towards me and I pretended to be into it. The pain he was putting me through had replaced the self harming."I had marks on my body where he used his hands to hit me. I felt dirty and like a sexual deviant."I blamed myself and thought it was all I deserved. I’m only now realising I’m not to blame." The girl did not attend court but her parents sobbed quietly in the public gallery as the statement was read by prosecutor Charlotte Newell.Another victim who was paid to have sex with Bancroft and Manicom said it made her feel "disgusted" and like it was "her fault".She said Manicom was initially "jokey and jovial", but the pair started to discuss putting a bag over her head which made her feel "frightened and really vulnerable".The girl said: “I completely lost the will to live, I hoped something would happen in the meetings that would end my life completely.”The second girl who was paid to have sex with Manicom said he “didn’t seem at all bothered by what he was doing” and “had no shame”.Another victim comes from a religious background, and ended up in foster care as her community considered what happened to be “shameful”, the court heard.Ms Newell said another teenager experienced “distressing and intrusive thoughts of revenge” against Bancroft and had to be put in secure accommodation for her own safety. One of the victims who gave evidence at the trial was 17 when she met Bancroft on a dating website as she looked for friends in London before she moved there.She said Bancroft controlled every part of her life and made her feel like "everything I did was wrong".The teenager said she will never go to Stratford in east London, Liverpool or Nando's - as they are all places she visited with Bancroft.She said: "I convinced myself I wouldn't make it through trial and I would commit suicide before the end."I just want to have a normal relationship and friends and not be anxious or nervous and sabotage my happiness. I just want to do normal everyday things people do and just be me again."Judge Del Fabbro said: “The kind of life you would expect for your children and grandchildren - your victims, many of whom had overwhelming vulnerabilities and were at a significant developmental age, have instead been harmed psychologically and physically - some irreparably. All have had their transitions into adulthood significantly impacted.”Manicom was working in the travel industry until the court case was published last month, the court heard.The pair were both handed Sexual Harm Prevention Orders which will include conditions restricting them from using the internet to speak to children.They were also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.
