It will increase by 1.25 percentage points on April 6, 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will go back down to 2021 to 2022 levels.  The levy will then become a separate new tax of 1.25 percent, collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. Once the new National Insurance tax increase comes into effect this year, the average worker will pay an extra £255 annually in taxes. Put into perspective, this means that an employee earning £20,000 a year will have to pay an extra £130. Higher earners on a £50,000 salary would pay an additional £505.   However, anything earned above this amount warrants a two percent tax rate. This means that as income rises above £50,000, National Insurance becomes a smaller proportion of the wage packet. This is amid rising inflation and energy bills that are continuing to contribute to the rising costs of living in the UK. The Bank of England has stated that it expects annual price rises to peak above four percent and stay at the level into the second quarter of 2022.  Such developments come in an effort by the government to raise £12billion a year, or £36billion over the next three years, in order to fund social costs. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an extra £2.2billion per year as part of the levy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that while the tax hike was not a part of the Conservatives’ original 2019 manifesto pledge, the new measures are necessary. He said they are needed to ease the pressure that the Covid-19 pandemic has placed on the NHS.  What is happening where you live?
