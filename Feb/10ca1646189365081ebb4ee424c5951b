  Former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan made a sly dig at his previous employer yesterday. The journalist appeared in Australia on Channel Nine’s Today Show and could not resist hitting out at ITV as he thanked the programme for having him.      Piers, 56, took to Twitter yesterday to discuss his Today Show debut in view of his 7.9 million followers. The controversial presenter wrote: “Great to be back on breakfast TV again… “Even if I did have to fly 10,000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions! “Thanks for having ne ⁦@karlstefanovic⁩ ⁦@AllisonLangdon⁩ - you guys are a class act,” he added with a thumbs up emoji.

The journalist previously co-hosted ITV Breakfast programme Good Morning Britain with Susanna Reid between 2015 and 2021. In March of last year, Piers dramatically walked out of the GMB studio following a row over the Duchess of Sussex. Shortly before the incident occurred, Meghan Markle and husband Prince Harry were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in a TV special.      During the interview, Meghan opened up about her mental health and even suggested that she had been feeling suicidal, which Piers said he “didn’t believe a word” of. In reaction to Piers’ dismissive attitude towards the Duchess, on the next day's show weather presenter Alex Beresford criticised his colleague on air for "continuing to trash" Meghan, prompting Piers to walk off set. Following the disagreement, Piers left Good Morning Britain for good and has remained an outspoken critic of both Meghan and Harry. The journalist then surprised Australian viewers when he appeared on their screens after a long time away from hosting breakfast television. READ MORE...

On the show he said: “G'day, Australia. Let's start with the weather forecast. “Contrary to everything that every Australian has ever told me about the weather in Sydney, it's raining. “And, in fact, it's been raining every minute since I got to Australia and it's going to rain every minute for the rest of the week I'm spending in Australia.        “But the good news for Ally is that she's finally got someone next to her who is intelligent, handsome, younger, [has a] better accent and a proven track record of smashing ratings records on breakfast television. “You know what, Ally? I like it here. This feels natural to me. “Karl who? That's showbiz. [He] made the fatal strategic error of letting me sit in his chair. And it just immediately feels natural.” If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.
