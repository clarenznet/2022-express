An estimated 220 people died in car accidents where at least one driver was over the limit in 2020. It was the lowest total since 2015, but as there were fewer incidents in lockdown it represented 15.1 percent of all fatalities. That figure was up from 13.1 percent the previous year and was the highest proportion since 2009. AA president Edmund King said: “The increase may be linked to people consuming more alcohol in lockdown and more people avoiding public transport. [It] seems to have had dire consequences on the roads in 2020.”
