Russia's top 23 billionaires have a current net worth of £286.2 billion, down from £312.1 billion at the end of 2021 and their wealth risks being wiped further as Boris Johnson met with British banks on Wednesday telling them he wanted the "toughest possible next tranche". A government source said finance officials told the Prime Minister there was a "very clear sense of the direction of travel" from a "package well calibrated". Uk Foreign Secretary also refused to rule out sanctions against Chelsea Football Club's billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich.
