She captioned the sweet photo: "On the eve of another birthday, looking back at little Cindy and thinking about what I would tell her. I would tell her to be kinder to herself, to treat herself the way she treats her friends. I would tell her everyone feels nervous in new situations and sometimes you just have to fake it 'til you make it. "I would tell her not to be afraid to make a fool of herself ‑ dance, sing, etc more - even if she isn't good at it. Laugh as much as possible. Be vulnerable. Risk showing her true self ‑ the payoff is worth it... Keep growing and learning and becoming... life is a blessing!" Cindy put on a leggy display in another Instagram post ‑ with celebrity friends complimenting her on her incredible physique. Naomi Campbell, 51, put a number of heart and fire emojis and Paris Hilton, 41, wrote: "Legs for days."
