London law firm, Farrer & Co, was involved in a case where someone tried to sue their neighbour for playing the piano. Apparently, the residents had not noticed their neighbour's musical habits while they were spending time outside. But when they had to work from home, they were significantly disrupted by the sound of the piano. However, the law firm told the Telegraph that the issue was resolved before reaching court. Siobhan Jones for the firm said: “We persuaded them that it wasn’t unreasonable for someone to practice a musical instrument in their home.” However, according to the law firm, the two parties mutually agreed to mediate the time of the day that the musicians could play the piano. According to the Telegraph, lawyers have seen a significant surge in rows of residents with neighbours. This has occurred as people had to spend more time at home due to quarantine rules and homeworking, which is now normality. Property consultancy Scanlans said they have recorded a 30 percent increase in property disputes. These may include quarrels over extensions, party walls and boundaries. Moreover, people reportedly are encouraged to chase their disputes due to household insurance. Tony Mancini told the Telegraph: "More and more people have legal expenses covered with their household insurance policies, and they are not afraid to make a claim under it." The severe weather conditions can also lead to damages to properties, such as fences, especially for terraced or semi-detached homes.
