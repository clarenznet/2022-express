Pupils who fail to gain a Grade 4 - equivalent to a C in the previous grading system - in GCSE maths and English could be barred from accessing student loans.Â The Department for Education says its proposal, which will be put to consultation, is about ensuring pupils "aren't being pushed into higher education before they are ready". The ban could also be aimed at those who fail to get two Es at A-level. Tom Allingham of Save the Student said: "It would be a devastating blow if students from disadvantaged backgrounds were to be denied funding, while students with the same grades but from more privileged backgrounds, could still attend university as their parents could pay."
