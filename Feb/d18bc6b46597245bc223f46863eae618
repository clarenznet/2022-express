The recovery came as investors digested Western sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime. The Stock Exchange suspended Russian-owned VTB Capital but the country’s banks can still use the SWIFT interbank payment system. Russ Mould, at broker AJ Bell, said: “The markets are telling us that the sanctions aren’t particularly dramatic relative to what they could be. “Some of it is people looking to buy on the dip and taking the alleged advice by financier Nathan Rothschild that you should buy on the sound of cannons and sell on the sound of trumpets.” Chris Beauchamp, at online trading platform IG, said: “While the situation in Ukraine keeps markets on edge, we have seen a recovery in risk appetite this afternoon. Whether this lasts long into next week is a much bigger question.” The rebound here was matched by markets elsewhere in Europe, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC both seeing recoveries. Salman Ahmad, global head of macro at Fidelity International, said the West keeping Russia in the SWIFT system was a “relief to markets”. However, he said sentiment could change quickly given the enormity of the crisis. Mr Ahmad added: “The difference this time around is that we have a major military power involved, and the tail risk that Nato gets involved is no longer a zero probability event. So markets are struggling to price these tail risks. “This rebound can change quickly if the situation on the ground changes.” Oil prices fell back below $100 a barrel as investor nervousness about supply disruptions eased. The price of gold – seen as a safe haven for investors in troubled times – dropped 0.9 percent to $1,885.76 an ounce. On first news of the invasion it had soared to $1,973.96 – its highest level since September 2020.
