But more than three-quarters have not sought professional advice on retirement plans, said research from investment company abrdn - formerly Standard Life Aberdeen. Only a fifth of women have used a financial adviser, compared with one in four men. Women are less likely to quiz a pension adviser, with just nine per cent doing so compared to 15 per cent of men. A third of the 2,000 people polled said they have not spoken to an adviser due to the cost, while a fifth believed only those with substantial assets would benefit.  Financial planner Shona Lowe, of abrdn, said: "Speaking to an expert can set you up a better retirement both financially and emotionally."
