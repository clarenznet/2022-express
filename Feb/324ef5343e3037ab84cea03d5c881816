The nine-year-old boy was snatched from the vehicle outside Minster Junior School in Croydon, south London, and driven around three miles to Thornton Heath in the capital. The youngster was let out there and collected by police, who returned him home. The school warned parents of the abduction in an email today. Hannah Farhan, who is the headteacher, wrote: "Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3.30pm a nine-year-old Junior School child was taken from his mother's car outside the school gates by two unknown men and driven away to Thornton Heath. The boy was let out of the car, picked up by police and safely returned to his home later in the evening. We have no description of the men or the car as yet." Metropolitan Police has been approached for more details about the offence. But one father told My London of his worry. "This is getting too serious. I'm taking time off work to take my little girl to and from school because this is very scary," he said. The offence comes after a child was grabbed by a man wearing a balaclava outside nearby Aerodrome Primary School on Wednesday. Zoe Foulsham, headtecher of that school in South Croydon, told parents: "Please could we ask that all children are brought to school and picked up by an adult wherever possible to ensure we are keeping the children safe. "I know this will be very worrying for our school community and if you would like any help or support when talking to your child about keeping safe please contact the school." Parents across Croydon remain on high alert after the two incidents.
