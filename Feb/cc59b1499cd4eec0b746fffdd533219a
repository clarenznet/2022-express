Dyson Supersonic is one of the most popular hairdryers on the market, but vacuum cleaner rival Shark wants to end that reign. Dubbed the Shark STYLE iQ Hair Dryer, this clever gadget promises no heat damage thanks to the ionised air and is compatible with three styling attachments. Shark says it has designed the STYLE iQ Hair Dryer to work with all hair types. Usually priced at £229.99 – and only launched a few months ago – Amazon UK has slashed the cost of the STYLE iQ Hair Dryer to an all-time low. The STYLE iQ Hair Dryer arrives with three Intelligent Stylers – including a Diffuser, 2-in-1 Concentrator, and a Style Brush attachment. Attaching these add-ons to the hair dryer will automatically adjust the heat and airflow settings to provide the best results. Shark says this feature is designed to remove any guesswork from styling your hair. It's a really clever touch that you won't find on the rival Dyson product. With a single touch, you'll be able to lock-in your style with the Cool Shot button. Shark will include a Styling Guide with every STYLE iQ Hair Dryer, so you'll be able to learn some tips and tricks to use with your new gadget. The STYLE iQ Hair Dryer included in the Amazon UK deal is Black and Rose Gold. There are no other choice of colours. The Supersonic rival is part of a range of Shark-branded equipment that's on-sale at the moment. Corded, handheld and cordless vacuums are all included in the latest round of discounts from Amazon UK. Prime members will be able to get the new kit delivered at no extra cost. Shark is owned by parent company SharkNinja, which combines the vacuum cleaner (and now, hair dryer) brand with the team behind Ninja food processors and cooking equipment.
