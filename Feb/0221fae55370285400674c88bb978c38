Police discovered a large number of deals of crack and cocaine at Jacqueline Robson's home during a raid. A court heard Robson, 57, was arrested and pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply on the basis she was going to return it to whoever owned it, or, failing that, destroy it. The defendant admitted cannabis plants at her property were hers but prosecutors decided not to charge her with that, which a judge said was "surprising". Robson's 20-month jail term was suspended for 18 months yesterday at Newcastle Crown Court. Judge Robert Adams also gave the mum a six-month curfew between 10pm and 6am. The judge said: "You have been involved through exploitation. "There was street dealing but not by you." A total of 68.3g of cocaine was found during a search at Robson's home in Walker, Newcastle, reports Chronicle Live.  Kevin Wardlaw, prosecuting, said in the kitchen, there were 46 0.2g deals of crack and ten 0.2g deals of cocaine, worth a total of £1,240. In a pillow case in a bedroom, there was a further £7,900 of drugs, including 39 crack deals and 68 cocaine deals, plus further packets of drugs. There were also scales, £500 cash and weapons, including a bayonet and a ball in a sock - which were not said to be hers. The court heard when police turned up they were asking for Robson's son, who has previous for possessing drugs with intent to supply.
