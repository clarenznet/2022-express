Chocolate, cake and biscuits have been named the most common comfort foods we need to perk us up. Other snacks to restore our sweet disposition include crisps, ice cream and pizza, the survey found. Among the more unlikely soothing snacks uncovered were crusty bread, rice pudding and fruit crumble. The poll of 2,000 adults found one in 10 turn to comfort foods daily, while 74 percent will always opt for foods that are high in sugar. Despite this, more than half of those quizzed acknowledged what they consume can in fact make them feel worse - with 57 percent feeling full of regret after eating certain foods. The most likely time people will turn to their comfort foods is when they are feeling sad or down, with 52 percent admitting to this. But almost the same amount - 48 percent - do it when they are feeling stressed. The OnePoll research also found four in 10 will use the weather as an excuse to indulge in consoling morsels.

Sports nutritionist Nigel Mitchel has teamed up with Aldi, which commissioned the research, to champion the importance of your diet on your mood and everyday life. Nigel said: "It's fascinating how our bodies react to certain foods.When our mood is low, we do tend to turn to things that give us a sense of comfort. "While we, of course, all want to enjoy a treat from time to time, it's important that we are aware of the link between our diets and mood to make sure that we are also selecting foods that can have a truly positive impact on us."
