"I was lucky to arrive six months before this came into effect - this also meant I could sort out my driving licence relatively easily."

Maddie shared what her first weeks in the country were like: "It can be daunting moving to a new country but I always try and plan reasonably well so things don't jump up at me i.e. car hire sorted, a place to stay (initially got that through a contact through work).

"I was back to the UK for only a month and then out to Spain. Then a new headship with all the pressures etc of getting to know both the workplace and the community. "I spent the first few weeks both getting up to speed with work whilst chilling down exploring the community (helped it was hot and summer) after a really quite unusual and stressful few months of lockdown in Dubai. I bought a lot of stuff to add to the two suitcases I had brought with me," she said.
