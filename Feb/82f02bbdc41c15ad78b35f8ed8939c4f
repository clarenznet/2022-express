Newcastle shareholder Amanda Staveley has confirmed that Jesse Lingard was eager to leave Manchester United in order to join the Magpies on loan at the end of the January transfer window. Lingard appears to be heading for the exit door at Old Trafford ahead of next season after failing to extend his current deal, which is set to expire at the end of the current campaign. The 29-year-old has failed to hold down a place in the United side over the last two seasons and has no intention of signing a new contract at the club he joined in 2000 at the age of seven.He has started just once in the Premier League since the beginning of the campaign despite being promised the chance to earn a regular first-team spot by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Ralf Rangnick upon the latter's arrival in November.Newcastle developed an interest in bringing Lingard to St James' Park in January in order to boost their hopes of securing top-flight survival after it became apparent that he was out of the picture at United.The England ace turned plenty of heads with an impressive loan spell at West Ham last season and was reportedly keen on joining another club once again at the turn of this year.However, he was ultimately prevented from leaving United at the eleventh hour and will be forced to run down the rest of his contract at Old Trafford as a result. JUST IN: Declan Rice has clear 'first choice' between Chelsea and Man Utd The Red Devils were said to have demanded a non-negotiable £12million bonus in the event of Lingard helping to keep Newcastle in the Premier League at the end of the season.Staveley has since admitted that Lingard was very keen on joining Newcastle, who did all they could to thrash out a deal before they were eventually denied in the final week of the January window.She also revealed that Lille defender Sven Botman expressed a similar interest in a mid-season move and would still be open to the possibility of joining the Tyneside outfit in the summer."We had to encourage players – ‘we’ll be a safe place for you, we’ll deliver and grow’," Staveley told The Athletic. "Some desperately wanted to come to us, like Sven, who still does very much and has talked very openly about that."Coming through all that showed us we can do it, that we can stick to our plan and if we get criticised on the last day for ‘oh, you’re going after Jesse’, well, Jesse wanted to come to us."We did everything. We never stopped. From the start to the finish, we did not stop working."Newcastle were among the Premier League's busiest clubs in the January window, making no less than five new signings before the all-important deadline.

They’re not looking after the player’s welfare." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport? Join our brand new Facebook group by clicking here
