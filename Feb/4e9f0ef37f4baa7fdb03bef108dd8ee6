The car is blocking part of the link road between the M42 southbound and the M6 near Coleshill, Warwickshire, causing traffic back on the M42 to junction 9 for Lichfield, Staffordshire and the M6 Toll. The M6 is busy in both directions as a result of the fire too, largely due to onlookers, on approach to junction 4A. The M6 northbound is particularly congested, with jams back to around junction 3A for the M6 Toll near Meriden, Warwickshire. Traffic cameras near to the fire show plumes of smoke rising near the two intersections and queuing traffic on the approach. National Highways says Warwickshire Police and Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service have both been called to the blaze. AndÂ Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service has confirmed two appliances were sent to the scene. But Coventry Live reports no diversions are in place at this stage. The latest Inrix travel website status update says: "M42 Southbound exit slip road to M6 Northbound blocked, stationary traffic due to car fire at J8 (M6 Interchange). "At around 12:00 all traffic was held to assist with the fire on the link road between the Southbound M42 onto the Northbound M6." Traffic was held completely at around midday to allow emergency service vehicles to get to the car. It is unclear if anyone was injured at this stage. The M42 runs south and then west from here, around Solihull, West Midlands, and part of Worcestershire to connect with the M5 near Bromsgrove in the county.
