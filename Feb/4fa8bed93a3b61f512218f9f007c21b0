But let us be clear, his gambit in the end has left him, his supporters and Russia exposed to an extent that could send the country back to the Dark Ages. The only thing Putin understands is firm action and a refusal to back down. His aggressive strategy must be met with a similarly tough and uncompromising approach by the West, including Britain. It is certainly good to see Western allies have united almost instantly on this issue and started to impose heavy sanctions on Russia and Putin's regime. According to one of his diplomats, Putin does not care about sanctions. But they will bite hard into the Russian economy, setting it back decades. In leading the way on this issue, Boris Johnson has shown himself to be an impressive leader on the international stage and stepped up at the right moment. The freezing of approval for the Nord 2 gas pipeline will be particularly painful for Russia and Putin. In the end, the president has reminded us of the bad old days of the Cold War. But in so doing he has only stiffened the resolve of Western allies and strengthened Nato again as an alliance for freedom. It is vital there is no let-up in punishing Putin's actions until he retreats from Ukrainian territory. Any softening will not only be a sign to him that aggression pays, but an invitation to other authoritarian regimes like China to do the same.
