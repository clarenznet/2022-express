Sophie Burns, 28, vanished from her home in Carlisle, Cumbia, on Sunday, December 12 and her devastated family had since assisted police with search operations across the rural county. Officers confirmed they discovered a body yesterday afternoon in Burgh-by-Sands, Cumbria, but are yet to formally identify it.  Nevertheless, Sophie's grief-stricken family and friends expressed their grief today. Her mum Pauline told Cumbria Live: "We will always miss our beautiful and talented daughter. "No one will ever replace the emptiness in our lives. "Sophie is a really bright and talented artist." In a public Facebook post, Sophie's partner Lucy wrote: "I can't believe I am writing this. You were loved by so many people. I wish you could have seen all the love and support since you went missing. "I wish I could just talk to you one last time and I wish I could have done more to help you. "I know you are at peace now from all of your demons. Rest easy Soaf, until we meet again. The brightest star in the sky."   During the search for Sophie, Cumbria Police carried out strategically coordinated investigations by specialist officers that involved numerous actions. Searches of specific areas were carried out, investigating and gathering intelligence, and working with partner agencies and specialist search teams, including dog units.  A spokesman for the force said today: "Police can confirm that the body of a woman was found in the area of Burgh-by-Sands at around 3pm yesterday (February 21). "Formal identification has not yet taken place and inquiries are ongoing. "The circumstances are not believed to be suspicious."
