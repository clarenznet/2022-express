Alexander Zverev has broken his silence after being withdrawn from the Mexico Open for an outburst that saw him repeatedly smash the umpire's chair with his racket. The defending champion in singles had lost his doubles match alongside Marcelo Melo when he launched a tirade at the umpire for what he believed was an unfair call during the match tiebreak. He has now apologised for his behaviour in a new statement on Instagram. Zverev was the defending singles champion at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel and had also entered the doubles with Marcelo Melo, a former doubles world No 1 and one of his close friends. The pair dropped the first set to Lloyd Glasspool and Harri Heliovaara but managed to win the second before falling in the first-to-ten-point match tiebreak and losing 6-2 4-6 10-6. The Olympic champion had been unhappy with what he thought was an unfair call during the breaker and vented his frustration at the conclusion of the match. Approaching the umpire's chair, Zverev attacked it with his racket as he smashed the chair multiple times, with footage showing the umpire's leg flinching.

Shortly after his fit of rage, both the tournament and the ATP Tour confirmed he had been withdrawn from the tournament as the ATP tweeted: "Due to unsportsmanlike conduct at the conclusion of his doubles match on Tuesday night, Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the tournament in Acapulco." As a result of his disqualification, the 24-year-old will now forfeit any ranking points gained from the event, be forced to return his prize money and have to pay his hotel costs. Zverev has now spoken out for the first time since his outburst, apologising for his behaviour and revealing he had already said sorry to the chair umpire.

Yesterday, I left too much. "I am going to take the coming days to reflect - on my actions and how I can ensure that it will not happen again. I am sorry for letting you down." The German will next be in action at the Indian Wells Masters, beginning on March 7. But he could face an ATP investigation in the coming days and weeks, that could see him heavily fined and temporarily suspended from the tour.
