Andy Murray has slammed Alexander Zverev for his “reckless” outburst during the Mexico Open. The world No 3 smashed the umpire’s chair with his racket at the conclusion of his doubles match in Acapulco and was withdrawn from the tournament. Murray has been competing in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships for the first time in five years. He crashed out to world No 10 Jannik Sinner in straight sets during his second-round match on Wednesday, and was asked for his opinion on Zverev’s tirade in Acapulco. The Mexico Open is another ATP 500 being held this week, where the world No 3 was the defending champion. Zverev was set to face lucky loser Peter Gojowczyk in the second round of the singles but was withdrawn from the tournament for his behaviour at the conclusion of his doubles match.

Having lost the first set, Zverev and Melo clinched the second but lost the match tiebreak, with the German launching a tirade when he thought a ball was unfairly called out at 8-6 in the breaker. “Look where the ball bounced. It’s 8-6 in the tie-break, look where the ball bounced. For f*** sake, it’s your line. It’s f****** your line. You f****** idiot.” After losing the match, the 24-year-old smashed his racket against the umpire’s chair multiple times, as footage showed the umpire’s leg flinching with each strike.

The whole f*****g match.” The tournament and the ATP later confirmed that the world No 3 had been withdrawn from the event, leaving him forced to forfeit any ranking points and prize money earned, and required to pay his hotel costs. Murray has since weighed in on the outburst, slamming Zverev for his “dangerous” behaviour. “It was not good. It was dangerous, reckless,” the former world No 1 said after his loss to Sinner. “I understand athletes across lots of sports, can get very frustrated. Certainly me, I've not always acted in the way I'd want on the court. I'm certainly not claiming to be an angel. I'm not perfect myself." While Murray is no stranger to venting his frustrations during a match, even smashing his racket on the court a couple of times during his loss to the world No 10 on Wednesday, he admitted it was a different matter when it was near the umpire. He continued: “However, when you're ripping your tennis racquet right next to the umpire multiple times, you can't be doing that. I know obviously one of the British guys who was playing, as well, a bit dangerous. It's graphite flying off the racquet, as well. Yeah, was not good." Zverev has since apologised for his behaviour on Instagram, saying: “It is difficult to put into words how much I regret my behavior during and after the doubles match yesterday. "I have privately apologized to the chair umpire because my outburst towards him was wrong and unacceptable, and I am only disappointed in myself. It just should not have happened and there is no excuse. I would also like to apologize to my fans, the tournament, and the sport that I love."
