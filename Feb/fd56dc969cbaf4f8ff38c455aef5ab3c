The Australian actress will be awarded a Lifetime César Award tonight. The French Award Academy said the honour was down to her “absolutely remarkable career and personality.” Cate looked effortlessly cool as she walked the red carpet earlier this evening. She wore high-waisted black trousers paired with a sequined suit jacket. The Australian actress wore a see-through top underneath, which fastened with just one button. She paired the statement black look with wavy hair, red lipstick and black stilettos. Bond actress Léa also looked stunning at the awards as she wore a strapless black gown. The star wore a white and black polka dot cape to complete her statement outfit. Adam wore a black tuxedo as his film Annette is up for several awards at the event.
