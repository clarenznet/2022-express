As photos of the Sussexes with Harry's cousin Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank in Santa Barbara emerged in US paper TMZ, the question arises whether the couple, who quit their royal duties and moved to California in 2020, may "sue for privacy". If they decided to take legal action, the case would join a list of other lawsuits launched against the press by the Duke and Duchess. Mark Stephens, a media law specialist at Howard Kennedy, said: "They can sue. There was a case where Paul Weller sued. He was sitting outside a restaurant in Santa Monica with his children and he sued for privacy in the UK." The British singer-songwriter, whose pictures were taken in California before being published on the Mail Online, sued under UK privacy laws in 2012 and won a Â£10,000 payout from publisher Associated Newspapers Limited. Mr Stephens, speaking to Newsweek, added: "They'll sue whoever published them in the UK, that's for sure. "I don't know whether they can get TMZ here, but it will be worth a go." The suggestion comes amid news of a libel action launched by the Duke against Associated Newspapers over an article. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
