Guests get a great chance too to support Pinch’s Ukrainian roots which bring a new style of drinking to the capital, enriching the renowned international variety of its hospitality. The bar’s unique vodkas are a standout feature, not least because they are a far cry from the better known one-trick, white hard-hitting spirit common in the UK. Instead the ones at Pinch offer nuanced blends of wheat, rye and barley that lend spicy, sweet and nutty flavours and invite the kind of considered tastings that have become familiar cornerstones of the single malt whisky and wine sectors. Pinch’s 80-cover interior compliments the ambiance too - full of eye-catching contrasts from bright terrazzo tiling to natural wood surfaces and threaded throughout with playful brass-monkey lights, beer barrel tables and refreshing greenery. A private drinking area offers an ideal spot for parties and tastings. For the bar’s young founders Yana and Alex it’s all the culmination of their dream to run their own business serving vodkas based on their family’s traditional nalvika recipe infusions. Guests can explore delicious flavours such as sour cherry, blackcurrant, cranberry, honey and blackberry or ones with savoury notes like horseradish: all served in elegant, stemmed liqueur glasses and priced from £9.50-£10. Bar manager Ricardo De Oliveira has curated an extensive cocktail list that highlights favourites with a special twist. Examples include the Pinch Margarita with El Tequilleno Reposado, Patron Citronge and agave, or the Kyiv Mule with Dima’s vodka (from London-based supplier www.dimasvodka.com), Peychaud bitters, mint and ginger beer. The trio have also tracked down independent brands to stock and Pinch’s global feast features ethical wines and spirits such as La Jara vegan and organic prosecco from Treviso in Italy, small batch hand-crafted Applewood gin from Adelaide in Australia and Macchu Pisco - an ultra-premium, naturally distilled Pisco made in Peru. Bar snacks and sharing boards include popcorn with smoked bacon dust (£4) with small plates of green bean tempura with garlic aioli’ (£6), and spicy prawns with heritage tomato, garlic and chilli (£8) while hearty sharing boards offer sliced white pepper and fennel salami, Hartgrove Coppa, wild venison sloe and garlic salami’ (£12).
