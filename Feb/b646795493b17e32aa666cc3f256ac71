Just 60.3 percent of patients in England were seen in person in January. That is up from a low of 46.7 percent in April 2020, but still well below pre-pandemic levels of about 80 percent. In-person visits recovered steadily between January and October last year, but fell again in the Omicron alert as GPs focused on delivering booster jabs. Dennis Reed, of the Silver Voices over-60s group, said: "The Government is saying we are returning to normal, so we need to return to normal in terms of face-to-face appointments." The NHS said there were 15.4 million in-person GP visits in January, and 9.2 million phone calls.
