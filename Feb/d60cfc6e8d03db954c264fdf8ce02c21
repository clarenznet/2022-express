This latest iteration starring Lennie James and Paapa Essiedu - both superb - puts a fresh spin on one of the playwright’s most accessible works. When Salter (James) loses his young son he has his DNA extracted to make a living replica. Unknown to him, the scientists responsible make a few more clones on the side. This latest iteration starring Lennie James and Paapa Essiedu - both superb - puts a fresh spin on one of the playwright’s most accessible works. When Salter (James) loses his young son he has his DNA extracted to make a living replica. Unknown to him, the scientists responsible make a few more clones on the side Salter is visited by his Number 1 Cloned Son and discovers that there are more of him hanging around. Shortly afterwards, Number 2 Cloned Son turns up and gets a bit stroppy with Dad. A few years later, Salter encounters a third clone in an art gallery. No 3 is American and blithely unconcerned about his status. On Es Devlin’s red painted set, framed by white light that delivers blinding flashes between scenes (an effect I first saw in The Father) Lyndsey Turner’s production takes on the aspect of a nightmare from which Salter - and the audience - cannot awaken.   The themes of paternal responsibility, unchecked scientific exploitation and identity jostle together striking sparks over its brief running time of 65 minutes. In an era of self-identification questions on what constitutes a person’s character and what happens if identity is diluted are more relevant than ever. A number is at Old Vic Theatre until March 19 Tickets: 0344 871 7628
