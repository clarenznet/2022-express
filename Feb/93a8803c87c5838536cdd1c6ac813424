But the picture is brighter in towns and cities for the prickly garden visitor because there is a more stable population, the report from conservation charities shows. The State Of Britain’s Hedgehogs report by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS) draws on a number of surveys in rural and urban areas. These include citizen recording schemes, animal road casualty records and reports of accidental hedgehog kills by gamekeepers. BHPS chief executive Fay Vass said: “They’re now facing myriad pressures, particularly in the rural landscape. Two of the main pressures in both rural and urban areas is lack of suitable habitat and habitat fragmentation.” Nida Al-Fulaij, conservation research manager at co-study authors PTES, says it supports funding hedgerow creation as part of the new farming payments scheme. She also advises existing hedges are kept in good condition and that field margins are not sprayed so there is a supply of slugs, caterpillars and bugs. In more built-up areas, people can provide access through fences and retain natural lawns, mowing less, to encourage numbers to rise. Data from 1981 to 2020 shows a steady decline in hedgehogs. Between 30 percent and 75 percent were lost in rural areas. While in urban zones the population is recovering, but from a low baseline.
