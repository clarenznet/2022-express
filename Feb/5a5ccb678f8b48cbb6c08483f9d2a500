Severe flood warnings - meaning a risk to life - are in place in Ironbridge, Shropshire, and Bewdley, Worcestershire. The Ouse in York flooded riverside properties, while parts of Shrewsbury and nearby village Jackfield are also under water. And there is no let-up to the weather that has battered Britain, with three storms hitting us in the past seven days. Last night forecasters warned that today will see more heavy rain, 70mph winds and even up to a foot of snow. More than 11,000 homes are still without power since last week's Storm Dudley, which was followed swiftly by Storms Eunice and Franklin. More than 160 flood alerts and warnings were still in place last night but conditions could worsen when high winds rock northern England and snow hits Scotland in coming days.  Temporary flood defences have been erected in Ironbridge and Bewdley. At least 60 properties had been evacuated in Ironbridge by last night. Britain's annual winter flooding crisis has prompted communities to demand a "permanent solution". Telford and Wrekin councillor Shaun Davies said: "This is a problem for the Severn as a whole and we need to make sure the solution is permanent." Meanwhile, police have named father-of-two Stephen Matthews, 68, from Aintree, Merseyside, as the passenger who died after debris struck a vehicle he was travelling in during high winds in nearby Netherton on Friday.
