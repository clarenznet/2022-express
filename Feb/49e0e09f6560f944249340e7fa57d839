The Intex Inflatable Four Person Hot Tub has sold out at Aldi multiple times, but the retailer is helping people get ready for spring by restocking the bestseller.

The high-quality inflatable spa is octagon shaped, with 135 bubble jets, heated air bubbles, and a 795-litre capacity that feels far more luxurious than the £399.99 price tag may suggest. Buy: Aldi (£399.99) Although the tub can fit up to four adults, it only has two headrests, so for ultimate relaxation it's recommended you opt for two. It’s not just adults who enjoy this tub either, with many of the reviewers saying their children and grandchildren couldn’t get enough of it. One reviewer commented on the large size and quality compared to competitors saying it’s “very good quality. "We had a lazy spa inflatable hot tub last year and the Intec is much better quality. “The tub itself self feels more robust and the cover is well designed and does an amazing job of keeping the heat in. "The jets produce a lot of bubbles. It’s is deep and a good size for four people”. Buy: Aldi (£399.99) Another added: “It is sturdy and deep, it keeps the temperature very well and the bubbles are quite vigorous! It is very good value for the money. We are very happy with it”. Some of the additional features include test strips, insulated and lockable cover and more. The colour of the tub is a stylish grey, and the dimensions are 201 x 201 x 71cm, which is perfect for a small to medium garden but fits best in a garden with a bit of extra space to work with.
