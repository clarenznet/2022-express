As the Strictly arena tour has wrapped up, Giovanni has not wasted any time and is back in rehearsals for Burn The Floor with new partner Lauren Oakley. Dancer Lauren took to Instagram and shared a video of the pair performing a sultry routine in the dance studios. In view of her 9,444 followers, she took to her stories and penned a candid message.

Rose penned: "Six months ago, I didn't have a clue what I signed up for and to be honest I was terrified. Now, I know for sure that it was the best decision I have ever made, what a crazy ride and life-changing experience it has been. "@giovannipernice , I am so grateful that you were part of my Strictly journey. "Thank you for telling my story and showing everyone who I am. Our friendship is so special and lasting for sure." Turning her attention to fans, she continued: "Thank you to everyone who supported us, it has blown me away, you are the reason we got this far and made such an impact not just from dancing.
