 Jayne Adye, Campaign Director at Get Britain Out addressed friends and supporters and described how the EU was busy holding up talks with "petty" discussions about the "classifications given to different types of olive oil which might move between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland". She added that low-level negotiators from both the EU and the UK are "discussing piecemeal issues which are so petty it seems beyond belief". She said: "With the UK and the rest of the world distracted by Ukraine, the EU will happily sit back and allow the current status quo to continue, because they know the longer the Protocol stays in place, they hope more and more people will forget about it and simply accept the status quo as the new reality."  She claimed that Mr Rees-Mogg had spent the last 2 weeks trying to advocate for changes in regulations and taking stronger risks when it comes to trying new things in the UK. However, she said these changes were being frustrated "at every turn" by the Prime Minister. She added that "the Prime Minister has lost his stomach for dealing with Brexit".
