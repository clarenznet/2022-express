Not all mums are into gin - some prefer a scotch. This single malt scotch from Speyside is matured for eight years in American oak bourbon barrels. After this, it is matured for three months in a sherry cask, giving the scotch an intense sherry flavour and a dark hue. The impactful flavour has distinct notes of toffee, candied almonds, dried fruits, along with a savoury undertone.

Give mum an audio upgrade with these in-ear headphones from Jlab. They’re sweat and water-resistant, perfect for a mum who runs or is partial to a sweaty workout. If your mum is the kind of person who’s always forgetting to charge her gadgets, these headphones have 24 hours of playing time with the included charging case, so she could get away with charging them every few weeks. Made from lead-free crystal glass, these premium wine glasses come in a set of six and are dishwasher-safe for pristine cleaning.

Most mums tend to be fairly time-poor, and one way to make their morning routine quicker and easier is by buying her a silk pillowcase. Silk pillowcases don’t tug on the hair and skin like other fabrics do, so she’ll be able to maintain her hairstyle overnight instead of labouring over it in the morning. This silk pillowcase from John Lewis comes in 13 colours, so you can easily match it to her existing bedroom decor. A combination of a primer and a moisturiser, this richly formulated base product helps skin to feel hydrated and helps makeup go on flawlessly. Shea butter makes the consistency rich but not greasy, instantly hydrating and softening the skin, while Vitamin B5, vitamin C, vitamin E and hyaluronic acid ensure skin looks glowing and clear.
