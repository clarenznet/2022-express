Natalie Steele, 32, pleaded guilty yesterday to the manslaughter of Reid, two, by reason of diminished responsibility. Reid died at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, on August 12 last year after being found critically injured at a house in Bridgend, South Wales.  Michael Jones QC, prosecuting, told Cardiff Crown Court the manslaughter plea was acceptable. He said reports from two psychiatrists said Steele was suffering from a psychosis and psychotic depression at the time. Judge Michael Fitton QC remanded Steele, from Broadlands, Bridgend, in custody. She will be sentenced on May 3.
