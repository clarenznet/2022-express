The Foreign Secretary told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme: “Britain has always welcomed refugees fleeing from war and we’re urgently looking at what more we can do to facilitate that.” It was put to Ms Truss that anyone who has no connection to the UK cannot get in and she was asked if that will be changed. She said: “We are looking urgently at what we can do. We’re working with European partners about how we support refugees who are leaving Ukraine. So, yes, is the answer.” Pressed on how many people the UK will accept, Ms Truss said: “This is something we are urgently looking at.” Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said visa restrictions for those seeking sanctuary in the UK from Ukraine are “totally unacceptable”. The United Nations estimates 368,000 people have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion was launched.
