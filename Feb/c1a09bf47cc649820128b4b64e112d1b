Visceral fat is made up of toxic cells that are lodged within the abdominal cavity, where they can’t be seen or prodded. Its infamous reputation owes in part to the chemicals it secretes, which hike the risk of cardiac events. Combining a good diet with regular exercise is the most logical approach to a weight loss of any kind. But adding one food to your diet could increase visceral fat reduction by a staggering 81 percent, according to one body of research.  By eating low-fat yoghurt before a meal, the calcium content could prevent fat from entering the cells, according to prior research. What’s more, low-fat Greek yoghurt contains twice as much satiating protein as traditional yoghurt, which prolongs the feeling of fullness after a meal. Its high-protein profile has been shown to drastically improve metabolism, which enables greater calorie burn throughout the day. Michael Zemel, professor of nutrition at the University of Tennessee, said in a news release: “Not only did yoghurt help the study participants lose more weight - the average weight loss was 14 pounds - they were about twice as effective at maintaining lean muscle mass. “This is a critical issue when dieting - if you want to lose fat, muscle. “Muscle helps burn calories, but it is often compromised during weight loss.” Researchers said the study reinforces the evidence that calcium and dairy protein play a role in determining body weight. Alongside diet, there is evidence that engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days, such as brisk walking or bicycling at a casual pace, could offer promising results.
