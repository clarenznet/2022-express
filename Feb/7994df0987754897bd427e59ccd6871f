Earlier this month, Her Majesty The Queen passed a historic 70 years on the throne and her Platinum Jubilee celebrations will be taking place later this year. One of the most highly anticipated events will be the Platinum Party at the Palace, following the iconic concerts for her Diamond and Golden Jubilees in 2002 and 2012. The unmissable show, which takes place on Saturday, June 4, will include “stars from film, TV and the stage will also tell the story and celebrate some of the most significant cultural moments from the Queen's reign.” Singer George Ezra is the first artist who has been asked to perform at the Buckingham Palace extravaganza, saying it’s “an incredible honour.” To give you an idea of who else fans could be expecting, the last couple of Jubilee concerts have seen the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and Queen live on stage. But if you’d like to be in with a chance of attending in person rather than just watching or listening along on the BBC, there is a ticket ballot that has now opened. Five thousand pairs of tickets have been made available, with more being handed out to selected charities. The ballot for tickets to Platinum Party at the Palace has been open since 7am GMT this morning and will remain open until March 23. Tickets are applied for in pairs, with each applicant being asked to include details of who their guest would be should they be successful. Winners will be notified by the end of April via email. If you have not been randomly selected then you will not receive one. To apply for the Platinum Party at the Palace tickets ballot on Ticketmaster, click here.
