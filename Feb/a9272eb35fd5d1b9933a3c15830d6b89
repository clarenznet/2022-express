Lewy body dementia is the most common types of dementia in the UK. The disease is caused by tiny clumps of protein known as Lewy Bodies. A person’s speech may be effected by the disease. What to look out for? According to the National Institute for Ageing, early signs of Lewy body dementia include: READ MORE: Dementia: The smelly warning sign that may 'precede' memory loss by almost 10 years All people with dementia find it harder to speak over time. This happens slowly, and the type of problem is different from person to person. As Lewy body dementia progresses, symptoms develop that more strongly resemble Parkinson’s disease. These symptoms include falls, increased problems with motor functions, difficulty with speech, swallowing problems, and greater paranoia and delusions.  Cognition also continues to decline, with shorter attention and significant periods of confusion occurring Those affected by Lewy Body Dementia face cognitive difficulties with communication including speech and swallowing disorders. In the later stages of Lewy body dementia, extreme muscle rigidity and sensitivity to touch develops. Like with Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia is marked by early, middle, and later stages. It's what happens during these stages that makes the two different. Lewy body dementia progresses somewhat differently from Alzheimer's disease. Notably, the symptoms—especially memory loss—can fluctuate greatly with LBD. Alzheimer's tends to worsen more steadily. While LBD currently cannot be prevented or cured, some symptoms may respond to treatment for a period of time, said the National Institute for Ageing. An LBD treatment plan may involve medications, physical and other types of therapy, and counselling. A plan to make any home safety updates and identify any equipment can make everyday tasks easier.
