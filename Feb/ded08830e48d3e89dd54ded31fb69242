The UK, US and allies have agreed to cut off a number of Russian banks from the main international payment messaging system, SWIFT - something the UK has been pushing for in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting Moscow's ability to access its overseas reserves. Sunday Express political editor David Maddox tweeted: "This is another example of Global Britain working well post Brexit... the package agreed has come about after hard lobbying by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss... a FCDO source described it tonight as "a big win" for them." Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there would be "nowhere left to hide" for super-rich allies of the Kremlin. Ms Truss tweeted: "We continue to work with our allies to impose severe costs on Russia, hitting the means Putin uses to fund his war machine. We are united in supporting Ukraine against this appalling invasion."   FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
