The stamps – in colour and black and white - celebrate the heritage of the longest-running and most famous domestic football competition in the world. Arsenal players Charlie George and Frank McLintock are shown parading the trophy won in the 1971 Cup Final in one of the six stamps in the main set. There is one depicting crowds on the pitch at the 1923 Final – the first to be held at the original stadium in Wembley. One of the biggest upsets in the FA Cup’s history when Lincoln City beat Burnley 1-0 in 2017 to become the first non-league side in 103 years to reach the Quarter Finals is portrayed.  And the FA Cup’s Royal Patronage is also marked with a stamp showing King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presenting the trophy to Sunderland captain Raich Carter in 1937. Andy Ambler, the Football Association’s director of pro game relations, said: “Historic moments from the non-league to the very elite create lasting memories, and we’re delighted that a selection of iconic moments are being celebrated by these Special Stamps.”  A further four stamps, presented in a miniature sheet, feature a selection of the competition’s artefacts from the National Football Museum, photographed specially for the stamp issue. Natasha Ayivor, of the Royal Mail, said: “The Emirates FA Cup has given the world some of the greatest displays of competition football and these stamps celebrate the magic of those moments.”
