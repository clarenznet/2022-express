Express readers took issue with claims from those suggesting Brexit has made the continent vulnerable. On Thursday, 137 people killed and 316 wounded in Ukraine on the first day of Russia’s invasion. Writer Marcus Chown told his almost 50,000 followers on Twitter the vote for Brexit was “a vote for Putin”. He wrote: “Unfortunately, a vote for Brexit was a vote for Putin to invade Ukraine because it weakened the Western alliance and emboldened Putin." Former civil servant Siobhan Benita posed a similar argument, suggesting it was a “shame that all those patriots who voted for Brexit didn't ask a few more questions about why Russia was so keen for the UK to leave the European Union”. Express readers responded to claims Brexit is to blame for the Ukraine crisis, with some saying “the real problem is Putin”. User IoW said: “If the EU hadn't treated the UK with total contempt then we might not have voted to leave." More users mocked those who voted remain as “clutching at straws”. One wrote: "Do Remoaners even know what this implies?! "By claiming it is Brexit's fault that gave Putin an opportunity to invade only highlights the weakness and uselessness of the EU! "They confirm the EU have absolutely no global standing without the UK as a member! READ MORE: Ukraine-Russia war LIVE: Europe funding Putin’s war! "It also shows how important the UK was for the EU, and get again vindicates our decision to Leave! "The EU took us for granted, they called us "special" in a mocking way. Look who's laughing now! "The EU wont lift a finger to help even a nation which was in the process of joining this joke of an trading bloc!"
