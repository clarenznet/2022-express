Alexander Zverev lost his cool in a doubles match loss at the Mexican Open and repeatedly hit out at the umpire chair with his tennis racket, calling the match official a 'f*****g idiot' - and has subsequently been kicked out of the entire tournament for his behaviour. The world No 3 entered the doubles draw alongside partner Michael Melo and they took on Brit Lloyd Glasspool and Finnish star Harri Haliovaara in the opening round. Zverev and Melo were clear favourites to win the game, but got off to a poor start by losing the first set 6-2. They roared back to tie the game after winning the second set 6-4, setting up a grandstand finish against the relatively unknown duo. But after a staggering 10-6 loss in the deciding set, Zverev lost his cool by attacking the umpire's chair in a fit of rage. He hit the chair twice with his racket before sitting down, standing up again and kicking the chair before he was finally led away from the arena.  And a statement from the tournament confirmed he had been disqualified from the singles draw. “Due to unsportsmanlike conduct at the conclusion of his doubles match on Tuesday night, Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the tournament in Acapulco," a statement read. This means his round of 16 clash against Peter Gojowczyk, which was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, will no longer take place. Zverev also let out a spate of expletives towards the umpire for 'destroying the match'. “You f*****g destroyed the whole f*****g match. The whole f*****g match,” Zverev shouted.  The result means a significant result for Redditch-born Glasspool, who will be aiming to reach his fourth ATP final with Heliovaara in just 12 months. The duo beat Sander Arends and David Pel in straight sets to win the Open 13 in France back in March 2021, however two losses last month in the Open Sud de France and the Dallas Open mean they have started the calendar year off poorly. British brother duo Neal Skupski and Ken Skupski, who both hail from Liverpool, won the doubles competition in Mexico last time out. And Glasspool will look to follow in their brilliance with after progressing to the quarter-final with the win over Zverev. Zverev won the doubles title with his brother Mischa back in 2019 after a superb performance in Acapulco. However, another win will not be possible this year after his expulsion.
