Kazakhstani MMA fighter Bagdat Dyusembaev has reportedly been shot in the chest and hospitalised. The middleweight was due to be back in action this evening (February 17) at Hardcore Fighting Championships 22 in Moscow. The incident, which reportedly occurred between Dyusembaev and a security guard, saw the fighter known as 'Kazakh' shot in the chest. According to Russian news agency Tass, the shooting took place on Wednesday amid a 'conflict' in a Moscow gym. A police statement to Tass read: "The day before, along Ordzhonikidze Street, house 10a, during a conflict with a security guard of a fitness club, MMA fighter Bagdat Dyusembaev received a gunshot wound in the chest. "The victim was hospitalized in the N. I. Pirogov City Clinical Hospital." The fighter's current condition has not been made public. Dyusembaev was in Moscow preparing to return to action against Russian Mikhail Avakyan on Thursday evening. The alleged shooting took place just one day before the scheduled fight date. With one of the Harcore FC 22 co-main event spots seemingly in jeopardy, the other main event will see Islam Zhangorazov face Vyacheslav Vasilevskiy.  According to his Tapology page, Dyasumbaev has lost both of his professional MMA fights on a 0-2 record, having made his debut in July last year. His first defeat was a corner stoppage against Yaroslav Kuk, before Danila Volkov earned a unanimous decision triumph two months later. The Kazakhstani middleweight then took a five-month absence from the ring, although that could be even longer in light of Wednesday's alleged incident. Thursday's scheduled fight against Avakyan was due to be his third with Hardcore Fighting Championship, but the promotion are yet to issue a statement on his reported hospitalisation.  Various reports indicate that he has actually taken part in more bouts, compiling a 2-4-1 record. However, those stats are yet to be formally verified.
