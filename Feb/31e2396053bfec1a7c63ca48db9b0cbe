He said the current system is being exploited by organised criminal gangs in a "deadly trade" of human trafficking, and UK citizens are "right to object" to people being here illegally. The Lords voted down measures in a Bill designed to strengthen Britain's borders last month, and next week it is due to return to peers to be voted on again. Mr Pursglove said: "The UK's asylum system is broken, and for over two decades the public have voted time and time again for reform. "That is why the Home Secretary (Priti Patel) is driving wholesale reform through our New Plan for Immigration - making the tough decisions to end the exploitation of our laws. This week, the House of Lords will again vote on the Nationality and Borders Bill. "I urge them to back the Bill so we can deliver what the British public want - which is to fix the broken system."  He is keen to tighten up rules on deporting foreign criminals, with activist left-wing lawyers regularly able to exploit legal loopholes to stop murderers and rapists being sent back to their own countries. Last week he joined a flight to Poland, with criminals being taken back to their country, to see first hand the work involved. "Sunday Express readers will agree that foreign offenders who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes have no place in our society, and the process to remove foreign criminals is a vital part of our immigration system," he said. "The plane took off at the crack of dawn with 21 foreign national offenders on board and they were handed over to the relevant authorities in Poland. "They had prison sentences totalling over 93 years for some of the most heinous crimes, including murder, sexual assault, rape, threats to kill, robbery, burglary and kidnap. "It's vital we do everything in our power to remove such appalling criminals from our country."
