Fortnite developer Epic Games has just released a brand new update for the hugely popular Battle Royale shooter. The new Fortnite update is out now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and Nintendo Switch. While the latest patch isn't a numbered update, and therefore doesn't make any significant changes, the good news is that you won't need to sit through any server downtime. Indeed, you can download and install the update right now. Keep on reading for the patch notes and details. The headline new feature for the latest Fortnite update is the re-appearance of bows. Flame, Shockwave, Stink and Explosives Bows have all been unvaulted for what Epic Games is calling Bownanza Week. Epic explains more: "From now until March 1, 2022, at 8:59 AM ET, bows from Chapter 2 Season 6: Primal are in the present day of Chapter 3 Season 1: Flipped. "Across the Island as Chest and ground loot, find plenty of Primal Flame Bows, Primal Stink Bows, Mechanical Explosive Bows, Mechanical Shockwave Bows, and of course: Arrows." Players can also complete a selection of Bownanza Week quests to earn additional XP and rewards. "After the bows return to the past and the “Bownanza Week” Quests are over, a new themed week will begin on March 1 at 9 AM ET. Like Bownanza Week, this week will bring a new batch of special Quests!" It's also worth mentioning that Bows and Bownanza rewards won't be available in Competitive Playlists. In other patch notes news, Epic Games has fixed a problem with users not receiving verification emails. "We're investigating an issue related to players not receiving verification emails in a timely manner when creating an account," Epic explains. "This issue is resolved, verification emails should again be arriving in players' inboxes without delay." According to the Fortnite Trello page, issues with tents, Web Shooters and quest logs have also been fixed.
