The Prime Minister informed the Commons on Tuesday that sanctions would be imposed on five Russian banks and three Russian billionaires, in response to Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and to send in the military. However, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith warned that the sanctions were not tough enough and that the UK needed to hit Russia “hard and hit them now”. Financier and political activist Bill Browder echoed this sentiment, taking to Twitter to ask: "Where is VTB and Sberbank? Where are the other 50 oligarchs? The ones whose names we can’t mention out of fear of libel." The Prime Minister is also under fire for falsely claiming in the Commons yesterday that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was “already facing sanctions”. Mr Johnson has since admitted he misspoke.  THIS BLOG IS NOW CLOSED
