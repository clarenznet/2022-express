Kepa Arrizabalaga was brought on for the penalty shoot-out and his antics drew some interesting reactions from the Liverpool players. Eduoard Mendy had been in sensational form for Chelsea throughout the match, keeping both Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk out with some terrific saves.  But, just like the UEFA Super Cup, Thomas Tuchel opted to bring on Kepa as the game was heading for penalties. The decision once again raised some eyebrows with even more pressure on Kepa to hand Chelsea the trophy. And he was doing everything he could to put Liverpool's spot-kick takers off as they stepped up to the plate. James Milner and Fabinho calmly slotted their penalties past Kepa, but Chelsea's outfield players were similarly proving clinical. Kepa then took an unusual stance for Virgil van Dijk's effort, standing right-of-centre. But he could do nothing to stop Van Dijk's rocket of a shot hitting the back of the net, with the Dutchman noticeably staring down Kepa after his effort. Trent Alexander-Arnold made no mistake with Liverpool's fourth effort before Salah was up next for the Reds. Kepa once again appeared to try and get Salah's attention to put the Egypt international off his stride. But the Liverpool forward always appeared calm as he stepped up, sending Kepa the wrong way in the process. And Salah was then spotted laughing while looking back at Kepa as he made his way back to the halfway line. It didn't look like anybody was going to miss as the penalty shoot-out went on with the likes of Thiago Silva and Ibrahima Konate needed. All outfield players ended up finding the net before it was the turn of the goalkeepers.  Kelleher was up first and he impressively sent Kepa the wrong way with a calm finish. It was all on Kepa to keep Chelsea in the shoot-out with boos from Liverpool fans ringing out behind the goal. And the Spaniard sent his effort high over the bar with Liverpool players soon rushing to celebrate with Kelleher.
