These volunteers were then divided into four groups based on their meat intake. The groups were: regular and low meat-eaters, fish-eaters and vegetarians. This study was the first of its kind because it considered the link between diet and specific cancers instead of overall cancer diagnosis. Apart from bowel cancer, men who were vegetarians or fish-eaters had a lower risk of prostate cancer as well. However, the study reports there might be some limitations to their findings.
