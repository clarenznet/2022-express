The French bulldog was found on Caledonia Street in Paisley, Scotland, by a member of the public on February 14. The dog, thought to around 11 years old, had a severely ulcerated eye, could not use his back legs and refused to eat. He was put to sleep after vets advised it was the kindest thing to do. The Scottish SPCA is appealing for anyone with information about the French bulldog to contact them. Chief inspector Laura McIntyre said: “The dog was a male, fawn French bulldog. "We estimate him to be around 11 years old and he was not neutered. “He was microchipped to an address in Falkirk but was reported missing from this address in June 2021. “The dog was in generally poor condition, and was suffering from a severely ulcerated eye. "He could not use his back legs and would not eat. “On veterinary advice it was decided that the kindest thing to do would be to put him to sleep and end his suffering.
