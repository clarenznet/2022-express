The idea, credited to Grohl himself, is for a rock 'n' roll Amityville, as his group The Foo Fighters (playing themselves) move into a haunted house to work on a new album. For the next four weeks, the Monkey Wrench hitmakers will live Monkees-style in a decaying mansion in the celebrity LA enclave of Encino as frontman Grohl falls under the spell of a man-eating demon. There's a goofy charm to the gory special effects and the band members' different acting styles give the action the unpredictability of a Children In Need sketch. What is happening where you live?
