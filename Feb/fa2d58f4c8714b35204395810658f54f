This is not something that should happen in the world's fifth biggest economy and needs to be addressed by the Government. What these revelations show is the genuine plight caused by the cost of living crisis in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Heating, fuel, food and tax bills are all going up and it is hitting people in the pocket.While the Government has to look at ways of bringing that cost down for everyone, there is an urgent need for some to have targeted support, such as cancer patients whose income has dried up and who are, through no fault of their own, relying on benefits as they fight this disease. Thank goodness for charities like Macmillan which has given out £1million to help cancer patients pay for heating. Certainly those in need should apply for their one-off grants of £350. But there is a requirement for a national strategy here and we look forward to Boris Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak addressing the issue. ----------------- WHILE Labour still seems to be fixated on cake and drinks in gardens, the Prime Minister is getting on with the important issues to transform this country.
