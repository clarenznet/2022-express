The royal cousins have always had a close bond and it seems for the last month they have been secretly allying. Pictures shared by TMZ show Mr Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie joining the Sussexes in their new neighbourhood of Montecito, California. This reveals that they have been in the USA since the start of the month when Eugenie and Harry were pictured at a sporting game together. Royals fans have been speculating over whether their children will have met and shared the same bond too. One user, Monarch71897881, wrote: "If Eugenie and Jack brought August with them, I can see Lilibet and August growing up with the same bond that Harry and Eugenie had as kids." Eugenie and Jack now live in Frogmore Cottage, where the Sussexes lived before crossing the pond. Another Twitter user, iamlrw, said: "I am ecstatic that Hazza & Meg and Eugenie & Jack were out minding their own business." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
