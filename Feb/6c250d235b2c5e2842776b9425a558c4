Privacy is the most important thing for VIP guests, such as politicians or celebrities, and one of the qualities they value the most in a hotel. The butler explained: "The guests don't want to see you the whole day. "But if they need anything, of course, you need to be close."  The Grand Riad hotel is designed as a traditional riad home. A riad is a type of Moroccan property with an interior garden or courtyard. It is often associated with palace architecture. The second floor of a riad is designed as a private floor for the residents or guests. Mohammed explained: "We have the mashrabiya, to keep your privacy. "You can see what's going on outside without being seen." The butler explained Moroccan architecture always include a mashrabiya "because in the past men were really jealous about their wives". "It's really wonderful, especially in the morning when you open the window," he said. Mashrabiyas are wooden screens that once masked the exteriors of buildings. They symbolise the legendary mystery of the Orient and they were mainly used to protect privacy. Mohammed added that as a butler something he never does "is touching the carpet or the curtains". "Because the housekeeping team I know they spend a lot of time arranging this so I try to avoid touching anything."
