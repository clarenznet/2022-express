But after two years of disruption, it cannot let poor service become the new normal." A Royal Mail spokesman apologised for delays. They added: "The rise of Omicron had a particular impact during Christmas and January, with 15,000 staff off work due to sickness and self-isolation at one stage. The situation has significantly improved. The number of offices reported as being most impacted by service issues has reduced from 77 to just one today."
