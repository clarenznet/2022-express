The live series, which will be produced by ITN and Channel 4 News, will air in May. It will see Neil, 72, examine the "biggest events of the moment", with "set-piece interviews with the highest profile politicians and newsmakers". He said it would "sweep up what's happened in the previous week, mop up what's in the Sunday papers, and throw forward to the upcoming week." Neil stepped down as the chairman of fledgling TV channel GB News last year. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
