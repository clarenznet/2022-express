Cillian Murphy, 45, has become something of an Irish movie icon, having starred in some of the biggest films in Hollywood, alongside some of the most sought-after talent. But despite his world-wide fame, the actor admitted it's "f*****g weird" when fans take photos of him without asking. In a new interview with The Observer, Cillian revealed he "doesn't go out much" and is relieved when people are "underwhelmed" when meeting him. But he added: "I'm always happy to chat.
