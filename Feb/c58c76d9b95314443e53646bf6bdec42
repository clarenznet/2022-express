ITV dedicated the episode of Lorraine to Phillip, as he celebrated his 40 years in showbusiness. Phillip couldn’t conceal his shock when Lorraine Kelly, 62, broke the news live on her show. Holding a book entitled Phillip Schofield: 40 Years, Lorraine quipped: “So here's a wee bit of a clue.      “I'm outside This Morning's make-up room, I've got a big book. He's currently getting ready behind the door, I hope he's there.” When Lorraine was met by a totally surprised Phillip, he was caught unawares backstage and protested that he didn’t have a microphone on. “We've got lots of surprises for you, lots of people who want to say hello. So please come with me or we'll be in big trouble,” Lorraine insisted. During the episode, which also featured Phillip’s co-star and best friend Holly Willoughby, the presenter spoke with his wife Steph and eldest daughter Molly. READ MORE...
