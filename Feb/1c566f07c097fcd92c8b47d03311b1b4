Flirting with the thriller genre, The Forest features an impressive cast led by Toby Stephens as a successful surgeon, Gina McKee as his elegantly troubled wife and Paul McGann as well, this is where it gets complicated. The shadow of Fatal Attraction hovers over the narrative as Stephens' mistress (Angel Coulby) begins making demands, threatening to tell his wife everything. When a radical solution is offered by one of his friends, it comes at a price. Although the story is overfamiliar - infidelity, blackmail, murder - Zeller's treatment is characteristically complex. The male characters exchange roles as scenes are repeated with subtle alterations, blurring the line between reality and paranoid fantasy. The mistress appears at the surgeon's house covered in blood like Banquo's ghost. An anonymous painting changes to an identifiable nude in the living room. The fractured staging - played out on three sets - echoes Stephens' failing mental state.  When the fatal consequences put the surgeon under an obligation to a Russian rival, it tilts towards melodrama. Ironically, the words of Stephens' daughter, who has left her fianc√© over his infidelity ("It was horribly banal"), could be readily applied to the play itself. While the performances are watchable and Jonathan Kent's direction assured, the unsubtle symbolism and stylistic motifs seem like theatrical gimmickry designed more to paper over the cracks than work in harmony with the subject. A pity. The Forest at Hampstead Theatre until March 12 Tickets: 020 7722 9301
