Because we are Ukraine.” Mr Biden after attending the call with Zelenskiy said: “I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the UN Security Council. “He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression.” Meanwhile, Ukraine has reportedly imposed martial law in which special restrictions will apply in order to keep the country calm and protect its economy following an attack on the country from Russia. Oleksiy Danilov, 59, warned Kiev could impose a state of emergency yesterday. He said: "These are preventive measures to keep calm in the country, so that our economy and our country can work." "Depending on the threats that may arise in certain territories, there will be either a more strengthened or more weakened state of emergency.  However, reports suggest martial law has now been imposed. During the martial law in 2018, Ukraine banned all Russian men between 16 and 60 from entering the country for the period of the martial law with exceptions for humanitarian purposes. Ukraine claimed this was a security measure to prevent Russia from forming units of “private” armies on Ukrainian soil.
