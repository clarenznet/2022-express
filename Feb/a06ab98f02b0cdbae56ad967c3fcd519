Air fryers are the kind of device that once you have one, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. But even though they are so useful, it can be hard to justify dropping up to £150 on a kitchen device. Luckily for you, Aldi has a Specialbuy that means you can pick up an air fryer for under £30, which is an absolute steal. The Ambiano Halogen Air Fryer is currently on offer for just £29.99, and comes with accessories included, such as a rack and tongs to help you get the most out of your device. Buy: Aldi (£29.99) DON'T MISS: Aldi is selling an air fryer for under £40 - but it’s selling out fast DON'T MISS: Aldi shoppers praise exclusive £4 face oil as 'luxury in a bottle'  One shopper who wasn’t totally sure about buying an air fryer said: “You can't go wrong for the price. “I was really unsure about buying an air fryer but for the price, it was worth the risk. Best purchase in a long time. I haven't switched my oven on since buying it”. Another said the fryer is a “must buy! Food cooks evenly and perfectly. “Oven chips cook a lot quicker in it, can easily see how it is doing and the air fryer is far more economical than the electric cooker. Buy: Aldi (£29.99) If you’ve been weighing up different air fryer models for a while now and are starting to get a bit of analysis paralysis, take a look at what this happy customer had to say: “I had looked at several halogen air fryers, many costing much more had often fewer accessories than the Ambiano from Aldi. "Now I would recommend this one before all the more expensive models”. This model isn’t the only bargain you can pick up from Aldi right now either, with a slightly upgraded version of this one from Ambiano going for £39.99, and another from Salter going for £49.99.
