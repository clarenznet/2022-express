Lily James, 32, looked sensational in sequins as she posed at Versace's runaway show for Milan Fashion Week. She stunned in a blue and pastel pink cut out dress which featured a plunging neckline and cut out over her stomach, leaving her taut abs on display. The sequins met in the middle of the dress, further illuminating the star's petite figure. She styled the outfit with a pink sequinned jacket, placed over her shoulders. Lily seemed to channel her inner Pamela Anderson, with her new project Pam and Tommy hitting Disney Plus earlier this month. The actress paired the dress with Versace silver heels and a matching gold bag. The star scraped her blonde tresses into a bun, making sure all the attention was on her runway look. Others attending the event yesterday included Kylie Minogue and actress Ferya Allan.
