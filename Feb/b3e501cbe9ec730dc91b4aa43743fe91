Sir James Bevan said yesterday the state of the UK's rivers is "flatlining" with just 14 per cent meeting good ecological status. He told the World Water Tech Innovation Summit in London the figure has stayed the same for several years. Sir James added: "We are seeing too much pollution from sources we have known about - sewage, farming, road run-off and industry. "Now new threats are seeping into our waters like microplastics and forever chemicals. "Campaigners are right to be saying that this is not good enough." But he claimed the public are to blame for the pollution and not the Environment Agency. Feargal Sharkey, the singer turned river campaigner, called the EA an "utter failure".
