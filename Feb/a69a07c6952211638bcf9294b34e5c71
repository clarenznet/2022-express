Taking action to reduce energy bills needn't break the bank either, as one of the most cost-effective energy saving home improvements starts at just £3. Ahead of the price cap rise, Norton Finance has ranked six money saving tips. Taking the new higher fuel prices into account, the research shows how mid-terrace households could save nearly £5,500 on fuel bills within five years. This is one of the “cheapest and most effective ways” to save energy and money. DIY (Do it yourself) draught-proofing starts at just over £3 for a roll of self-adhesive draught-excluding tape. People can block up unwanted gaps around windows, doors and chimneys that let cold air in and warm air out. Doing this could save around £370 on fuel after five years.

About a third of heat is lost from walls of uninsulated houses. The age of someone’s home will usually determine the type of walls they have. This in turn affects the cost of insulation. Solid walls let twice as much heat escape as cavity walls. While insulating solid walls can be more expensive, the savings on the heating bills will also be bigger. Insulating the walls of an average mid-terrace house costs under £400, with savings of over £900 after five years, saving 415kg of carbon each year. What people will spend: £400What they will save: £924 Boilers are improving in energy efficiency all the time. If someone needed to replace their boiler, a new model could cost around £2,500, but they could save almost £1,600 on bills within five years if they are in a mid-terrace house. Not only that, but a new boiler will also reduce the household’s carbon footprint by 1.92 tonnes of CO2 every year. What people will spend £2,500What they will spend £1,578 An estimated 20 percent of heat can be lost through standard windows. Norton Finance recommended that Britons invest in energy-efficient double-glazed windows to make savings of nearly £1,500 in heating bills over five years. Installation costs average out at around £4,500 for A-rated PVC windows in the average semi, compared to around £15,000 for A-rated hardwood windows. Double glazed windows can reduce the CO2 emissions of a typical household by three quarters of a tonne every year. What people will spend: £4,500What they will save: £1,471 These days, an average solar set-up will cost £4,800 all-in. But if someone tends to be at home all day, it’s estimated that a 3.5kW panel will save them £571 a year - that’s nearly £3,000 in five years. Not only that, but a typical solar panel also saves over 10.8 tonnes of CO2 per year. Most homes have upwards of 12 panels; that’s 10.8 tonnes of carbon saved every year, not to mention money paid back thanks to the smart export guarantee. What people will spend: £4,800What they will save: £2,856 If people do these things, they can save nearly £5,500 on their fuel bills within five years at today’s costs. If Britons can swap to solar panels, they are looking at over £6,800 saved.
