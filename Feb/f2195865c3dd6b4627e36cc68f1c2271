The Kremlin has suggested comments made by the British Foreign Secretary were the reason that Russia put its nuclear forces on heightened alert. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Vladimir Putin said: "There had been statements by various representatives at various levels about possible conflict situations and even collisions and clashes between NATO and the Russian Federation. We consider such statements absolutely unacceptable. I will not name the authors of these statements, although it was the British Foreign Secretary." The Kremlin did not specify which comments made by Ms Truss had caused offence. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
