So far, western officials have only discussed economic sanctions, an option dismissed by some experts as not hard-line enough. Over the last few weeks, NATO has offered military assistance via training and technology without entering direct conflict with Russia. Should that ever transpire, the UK could end up against a terrifying Russian fighting force comprised of advanced military aircraft. Russia has one of the world's most formidable armies, with approximately 3,013,638 soldiers and an official budget of $48.2 billion. That money has allowed the military to complement their ground forces with top-of-the-range aircraft. The Russian Aerospace Forces have a selection of roughly 4,163 planes, helicopters and more at their disposal.

Among the modern section of the army are 350 Su-27-types - twin-engine multirole fighter jets. They can count on support from Su-27SMs and brand new Su-35 "Flanker-E", a successor to the Su-27s. Despite their size, being 21.9 metres long, with a 15.3-metre wingspan and 5.9-metre height, they only need one pilot to deliver the 8,000kg payload. At present, the organisation counts approximately 33,200 active military personnel. A further 1,940 Royal Auxiliaries and 3,300 reserve personnel are waiting in the wings. Altogether, they have a selection of 832 operational aircraft to pick from. These include some of the most advanced jets available, such as the F-35B Lightning, a compact but fast aircraft able to travel at Mach 1.6 (1227.63mph), measuring 15.60 metres long, 4.36 metres high and with a wingspan of 10.70 metres. Should the UK ever have to size up the Russian Air Force, however, it will do so with additional support. As a collaborative organisation, its Air Force combines the might of 30 nations into one fighting force. The airborne wing is known as Allied Air Command, which operates across Europe, the Americas and Africa with a force of unspecified size.
