Oliver Bredski, 20, left a note saying: "I've been sacked" then hanged himself. He was found by his sister Rachel, who cut him down with the help of a neighbour. Paramedics resuscitated him but he was in a coma until his life support was switched off 11 months later, last July, when he was 21. An inquest heard the Zoom video call with a Deloitte executive had ended at 11.17 am and Oliver, who'd gone to the Â£13,380-a-year Manchester Grammar School, was found at 11.30 am in the family home in Kersal, Greater Manchester. His dad Martin, 62, said: "Lockdown was a struggle for Oli and it must have affected his work. He mistakenly thought his dreams, his hopes and plans had been brutally ripped away from him." The Rochdale hearing was told he'd had depression and anxiety and almost took his life in 2017. He volunteered for the Youngminds charity, which called him "an inspiration". Deloitte said they were not aware of his mental health issues and would have "taken a different course of action" if they had. In a narrative verdict, Coroner Catherine McKenna said: "I think he was in shock and did not fully appreciate the consequences of what he was doing."
