Last year, the Government consulted on plans to change the upper exemption age from 60 to state pension age, which is 66. This consultation ended on September 2, 2021 and ministers are deliberating on a decision.  If the proposed changes do come into effect, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Sajid Javid, who will then implement the final decision. There is speculation that the proposed changes could potentially come into force from April this year, but this is yet to be officially verified. It is estimated the move could bring in £300million for the NHS from 2026 to 2027. On April 1, 2021, the prescription charge increased by 20 pence.  More specifically, it went from £9.15 to £9.35. This represented a rise of 2.1 percent in line with inflation. People with serious health conditions could limit the total cost of their prescriptions regardless of their age by purchasing a Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC). This costs £108.10 for a year of 'free' prescriptions.   Those on low income, that is via certain Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits and tax credits and the NHS Low Income Scheme, are exempt from paying for prescriptions. This includes expectant or new mothers. The proposed Government change to increase the free prescription age could affect up to 2.4 million people. They could face an array of new barriers when accessing their vital medicines, according to Age UK. At the time, the Prescription Charges Coalition said on its current trajectory, the charge could hit £10.15 by 2025.  The Office for National Statistics estimates there are more than 3.7 million 60 to 65 year olds in the UK and around two-thirds (66 percent) would be rendered ineligible for free prescriptions should the new proposals come into effect. Over the past 10 years, the cost of prescriptions has risen by a whopping 26.4 percent. This is an increase of £1.95 per item, according to a report by Chemist4U. Around £600million was generated from prescription charges in 2019.  What is happening where you live?
