As the cost of living crisis continues to bite, low paid Britons will be eagerly awaiting their next pay rise. Low paid workers and pensioners have been some of the hardest hit by rising inflation and soaring energy bills. More than a quarter of a million (300,000) people throughout the UK will be affected by the new wage increase. The National Minimum Wage is the minimum pay per hour that almost all workers are entitled to.
