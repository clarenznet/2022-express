It's not often that the latest iPhones get a genuine discount but that's exactly what Apple fans are being offered right now. Thanks to a new sale event from UK retailer Currys, there's some big money off a range of iPhones including the iPhone 12, iPhone 13 and smaller iPhone 13 Mini. The price cut means you can now grab an iPhone 12 for under £530 - that's one of the lowest prices ever. If you want the latest and greatest device from Apple then you'll also find the iPhone 13 dropped to as low as £629 which is a £50 saving off the usual price.

Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 now arrive with 5G technology inside which allows them to access the wen at speeds of over 300Mbps when away from fixed-line broadband. If you opt for the older iPhone 12 then you'll find that it's powered by the very capable A14 Bionic processor and there's access to the latest MagSafe charging technology which offers a more reliable way of refilling without a wire being plugged into the device. There's also a dual-lens rear camera, OELD screen and 64GB of internal storage. Want something a little more feature-packed? The iPhone 13 might look pretty similar to the iPhone 12 but this device gets a more powerful A15 Bionic processor, bigger battery and improved rear camera which now includes Apple's clever Cinematic mode video recording. The iPhone 13 also comes with 128GB of internal storage - that's something you have to pay extra for on the iPhone 12.
