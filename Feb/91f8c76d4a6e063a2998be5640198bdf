FIFA and UEFA have released a joint statement confirming that Russian teams will not compete in their competitions. It is a slight U-turn on FIFA's stance from Sunday, in which they insisted the Russian national team would need to play under the guise of the 'Football Union of Russia'.  FIFA announced a list of sanctions on Russia amid president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Russia were due to play Poland in a World Cup qualifier in March. However, the Polish football federation insisted it would refuse to play a Russian team, even if it were under a different guise. “Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.” “UEFA has today decided to end its partnership with Gazprom across all competitions,” a separate statement read. “The decision is effective immediately and covers all existing agreements including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA national team competitions and UEFA EURO 2024.” The announcement will also see Russia banned from this summer's women's European Championship, which is due to be held in England.  On Sunday, the Football Association joined several other nations - including Poland - insisting they will not take part in matches against Russia. An FA statement read: “Out of solidarity with Ukraine and to wholeheartedly condemn the atrocities being committed by the Russian leadership, The FA can confirm that we won't play against Russia in any international fixtures for the foreseeable future. “This includes any potential match at any level of senior, age group or para football.”
