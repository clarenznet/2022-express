Vladimir Putin's troops are quickly closing in after taking control of the strategic Chernobyl nuclear power plant today. Three US officials told Newsweek forces could seize the Ukrainian capital within 96 hours. They fear the Russian President is planning to encircle forces in Kiev and force them to either surrender or be destroyed by Sunday. It is also feared the Ukrainian leadership could also fall within the next week. A former senior US intelligence officer said: "After the air and artillery end and the ground war really starts, I think Kiev falls in just a few days. "The military may last slightly longer but this isn't going to last long." A source close to the Ukrainian Government also warned Kiev will be surrounded within 96 hours but backed the Government to stand firm. This comes with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signing a decree on the general mobilisation of the country's military. A NATO diplomatic official also warned Newsweek the US assessment "does sound rather believable". However, the unnamed official also warned the next 24 hours would be the "most critical". Much to the surprise of many, Ukraine has fought back in an attempt to withstand the Russian onslaught. A source close to Zelensky explained to Newsweek: "They say Ukraine is holding better than they expected." The statement seemed to be echoed by the ex-CIA director general David Petraeus. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme: "What was achieved [by Russia] today was less than I expected."
