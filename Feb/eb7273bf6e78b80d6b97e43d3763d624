Dame Vera captured the hearts of the nation during the Second World War with her uplifting musical performances and recordings. She became known as the "Forces' sweetheart", giving concerts to troops as part of the Entertainments National Service Association. The March 21 service will pay tribute to Dame Vera's career as an entertainer, which spanned more than 90 years. Dame Vera died in June 2020 at the age of 103. Her popular songs captured the wartime spirit and included We'll Meet Again, The White Cliffs Of Dover and A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square. Her career continued after the war and in 1954 her cover of My Son, My Son was No 1. What is happening where you live?
