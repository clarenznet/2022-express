FIFA are reportedly set to ban Russia from competing in its international football competitions. It is a slight U-turn on its stance from 24 hours ago, when they released a statement saying Russia would compete under a 'Football Union of Russia' banner.  On Sunday, FIFA announced a set of sanctions imposed on the Russian football team in the wake of president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. However, amid FIFA's sanctions, those nations reiterated that they will not play against any team representing the state of Russia, under whatever guise. Russia were set to face Poland in a 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off in March, but their opponents were among several nations to insist that they will not face a Russian team. “This includes any potential match at any level of senior, age group or para football.” Poland manager Jakub Kwiatkowski added to LBC on his side's scheduled World Cup qualifier: "We were discussed this last couple of days and finally, during the night, Friday to Saturday, we decided that our statement is that we are not going to play with Russia. "It doesn't matter neither neutral ground or in Russia. "This is the final decision in this circumstances when this brutal aggression of Putin to Ukraine we don't see and we do not intend to play the match with this country. Yes, with the players who represent such values like Russia, yes, they attack their neighbours. "So for us, it's obvious that we can play with them."
