Barcelona boss Xavi is weighing up a summer move for Chelsea loanee Saul Niguez in addition to taking Cesar Azpilicueta on a pre-contract agreement, according to reports. Saul joined the Blues on a temporary basis from Atletico Madrid at the beginning of the campaign but has failed to make a lasting impression over the course of his short spell in west London. The midfielder has made just six Premier League appearances and has failed to provide a single goal or assist for Chelsea in all competitions this season.It seems likely that Saul will head back to Madrid at the end of the campaign if Chelsea decide against exercising their option to buy him in the summer.However, there are said to be questions over whether he will be reintegrated into the Atletico side upon his expected return to the Spanish capital.Barcelona could be in line to emerge as a surprise destination for Saul if Xavi opts to firm up his reported interest in the playmaker with an official bid.The Catalan giants have identified Saul as a potential option to serve as a long-term replacement for Sergio Busquets, according to Sport. JUST IN: Tottenham boss Antonio Conte lifts lid on Levy talks after outburst It is claimed that Barcelona are long-term admirers of the Chelsea loanee and tried to secure his services before the Blues snapped him up last summer.Saul is said to be keen on the idea of joining Barcelona in order to work under Xavi and would provide cover for the likes of Gavi, Pedri and Frenkie de Jong in the engine room.The report suggests that Atletico could decide to include Saul in a future offer to land Antoine Griezmann, who is spending the season on loan at the club from Barcelona.The La Liga champions are believed to be looking to capture Griezmann's signature on a permanent basis and the option of a straight swap is said to have already been discussed between the two clubs. Meanwhile, it seems  as though Chelsea may end up losing two of their current players to Barcelona over the coming months if Azpilicueta ends up following Saul to the Nou Camp.The 32-year-old will be a free agent at the end of the season as things stand and is yet to extend his current agreement with the Blues.Barcelona have recently been credited with a desire to land Azpilicueta, who is said to be privately weighing up his options before making a firm decision on his future ahead of the summer months.Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel recently insisted that he would like the situation to be resolved as soon as possible in order to aid his preparations for a renewed Premier League title challenge next season.

It is not the biggest pressure on this subject but as you know, we have some other players also with contractual situations that are not fully solved."This is also nobody’s particular fault. This can happen sometimes in the moment we deal with it, and Azpi deals with it very professionally."I do not have the feeling that it affects any of his performances. We are on it behind closed doors, this is where it needs to be dealt with." Want the latest Premier League news as we publish it on Express Sport? Join our brand new Facebook group by clicking here
