Trigger Point garnered almost 11 million viewers across BritBox, ITV, and the ITV Hub with its plot based on Counter Terrorism Policing. The series is produced by Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio who is honoured by the success of the crime thriller. He said: "Everyone at HTM Television (Hat Trick Mercurio) is thrilled by the success of Trigger Point. Thanks to all our brilliant cast and crew and especially to the viewers who watched in such large numbers. We've received unswerving support from ITV throughout the production and we are delighted to have been commissioned for a second series.” The screenwriter and producer, whose work also includes the political thriller Bodyguard and medical drama Bodies, was recently made an OBE for his services to TV drama. Trigger Point was written by screenwriting newcomer Daniel Brierley, who said he was "honoured and excited" to be given the chance to continue the storyline. He added: "I feel there's many more twists and turns in [Lana's] future. It's been thrilling to see how the public have responded to our show and I can't wait to see what they will make of the next instalment!” Polly Hill, the head of Drama of ITV expressed her excitement for Brierley’s well-written scripts that kept the audience glued to their seats for 6 hours. She said: “I am so delighted to see Trigger Point return. Vicky is stunning as Lana and it’s brilliantly produced by Jed and HTM, but I also want to congratulate Daniel for his scripts. To have held the audience in a state of tension for 6 hours so brilliantly, you can’t believe it’s his first show. I can’t wait to see where series two takes Lana and her team.” The series can be watched on ITV Hub and BritBox.
