Temperatures will reach double figures today despite unsettled blustery weather sticking around for the next few days, especially in the north-west. Forecasters said East Anglia can expect a frost this morning while Londoners will wake up to temperatures of 1C. However, better weather will blow in during the day with plenty of welcome sunshine across most of England. Several rain and snow fronts will cross northern parts of the country tonight hitting western Scotland and Northern Ireland. North-west Scotland may see some snow tomorrow, but most of the UK will enjoy plenty of sunshine and temperatures could reach as high as 50F in the south. The north-west will be breezy with some patches of rain. The Met Office described the jet stream, which has been driving storm systems across the north Atlantic in recent weeks, as still being very active. However, these winds are shifting further north and may allow for more settled weather to arrive for much of week. Meteorologist Alex Deakin said the weather will “remain pretty lively over the next certainly four or five days, chopping and changing day-on-day”. After a spell of rain on Monday, calmer weather is forecast from Tuesday, though the clear skies could bring frosty mornings, the Met Office said. The Environment Agency only had a total of 41 flood warnings or alerts yesterday. Last Sunday there were 111 flood warnings, where “flooding is likely” and 152 alerts where “flooding is possible”.
