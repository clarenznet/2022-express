The video, filmed allegedly by a foreign journalist wearing a helmet and a backpack on his front, was posted on a Russian Twitter account. During the clip, a missile flies overhead while cries of "that's a missile' can be heard. The grainy pictures show a tiny object, circled in red, believed to be a Caliber missile, hurtling through the sky. The road below is deserted apart from one yellow van passing.
