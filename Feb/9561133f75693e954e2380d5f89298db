Auctioneers Bonhams in London on March 2nd are hosting a Sir Michael Caine: The Personal Collection sale of all things related to the 88-year-old Zulu and Educating Rita Hollywood great, such as rare artwork and posters. Now it's been confirmed his Guyanese model wife Shakira Caine, 75, will also be displaying and selling her own jewellery there, with some items she cherished and wore herself. Lady Caine married Sir Michael in 1973 after he became obsessed with finding and meeting her when he spotted her in a Maxwell House coffee advert in 1971, only to discover she lived round the corner from him in London. She was born to Muslim Indian parents and credits her mother, a dressmaker, for inspiring her first into modelling and later into becoming an acclaimed fashion designer in her own right. Shakira was inspired to create Far Eastern-style necklaces, earrings and bracelets after visiting The Costumes of Royal India, exhibition, curated by the late Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in the early 1980s. Speaking at the time, she said: “I was inspired by all of the Mogul jewellery. Indian jewellery will always live on. "It’s alive, vibrant, and always worn with pride. It gives you a spark, a lift. I love the vivid colours, the craftsmanship, the individuality, and the subtlety of stones. What is happening where you live? Find out by adding your postcode or visit InYourArea
