Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke is willing to back Edu and Mikel Arteta by funding a large-scale recruitment drive in the upcoming summer transfer window, according to reports. The Gunners were the Premier League's biggest spenders during pre-season, splashing in excess of £150million on no less than six new arrivals before the all-important deadline. Their big-spending habits managed to strengthen Arteta's squad after an initially poor start to the season, with a top-four finish in the Premier League now well and truly on the cards.Arsenal will be looking to pip the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham between now and the end of the season in order to seal Champions League qualification for the first time since 2016.It seems as though the Gunners are planning for another lucrative spending spree ahead of next season regardless of whether or not they manage to return to Europe's premier club competition over the coming months.Kroenke has long been criticised for his reluctance to provide investment but is expected to bankroll a major recruitment drive in the summer, according to football.london.The report claims that Kroenke has promised a 'significant summer outlay' in order to aid Edu's efforts as he looks to use the transfer market to his advantage.

The Gunners also tried to sign Arthur Melo on loan from Juventus to add to their midfield ranks but were ultimately denied by the Serie A giants despite reportedly agreeing a deal to bring him to the Emirates Stadium.They have also been credited with a desire to land Real Madrid playmaker Marco Asensio in recent weeks but could be forced to pay a fee in the region of £50million for his signature, according to Sport.It remains to be seen which direction Arsenal and Edu will go in ahead of next season as they look to maintain their steady levels of progress under Arteta's guidance for the foreseeable future.Former England defender Danny Mills recently insisted that Arsenal should be aiming to land a new striker as a matter of priority before turning their attentions elsewhere over the summer months.

The only concerning thing is Lacazette and Nketiah are out of contract."All of a sudden Arsenal could have no strikers come the summer. I’m assuming they’ve got something lined up."It doesn’t look like Lacazette or Nketiah are going to stay. That’s the only strange thing about the Aubameyang deal, maybe you should give that to Lacazette."Or they’re going to give it to a replacement and they’ve already got that signing done for the summer."
