More than 900,000 fewer women over the age of 45 were checked in the year to March 2021 – a dip of 44 percent. Just 1.19 million went to appointments compared to 2.12 million in 2020-21. Campaigners said it was “an alarming reminder” of Covid’s devastating impact on diagnosis. They warned there could be hundreds of extra deaths in the coming decade as a result of the disruption. NHS data also showed the number of over-45s diagnosed with breast cancers fell by 39 percent from 17,771 in 2019-20 to 10,813 in 2020-21.   Experts say the sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more likely treatment is to be successful. Baroness Morgan added: “Improving uptake and clearing the backlog of delayed invitations are critical actions that NHS England must prioritise. “Next year’s screening figures will be the true indicator.”
