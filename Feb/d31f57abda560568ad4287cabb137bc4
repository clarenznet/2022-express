41 years ago (1981) In a special souvenir issue, we celebrated the engagement of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. Following months of speculation, the couple made an official announcement at Buckingham Palace. Diana wore a Â£30,000 engagement ring made up of 14 solitaire diamonds surrounding a 12-carat oval blue Ceylon sapphire. The same ring is now worn by Kate, Duchess of Cambridge.
