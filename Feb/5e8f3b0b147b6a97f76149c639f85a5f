Holly Willoughby, 41, looked amazing in a two-piece white suit at her Wylde Moon immersive event. She celebrated the launch of her company's first fragrance at the London Coliseum this evening. The This Morning presenter styled her suit with black and white polka dot stilettos and wore her blonde tresses in its regular wave. Holly was joined by many celebrity pals including Kate Thornton, her sister Kelly Willoughby, Myleene Klass and Emily Atack to name a few. Her best friend, Phillip Schofield, also showed his face, supporting his This Morning co-star, amid the recent backlash he has received from former co-star Eamonn Holmes. Eamonn spoke the Daily Mail's Weekend Magazine on Saturday about a moment when Phillip seemingly cut his wife Ruth Langsford off. He said: "Phillip is renowned for snubbing people. It's up to Ruth to say how she felt, but I was feeling hurt for her. "No one would have snubbed me like that. "I have a good Belfast street fighter in meâ€¦ I would be direct. "I don't go for presenters who think they have a special privilege or aura or influence." At the time, Express.co.uk contacted Phillip's reps for comment. Phillip has been celebrating 40 years on television this week, with a segment on Lorraine including messages from Holly as well as Fern Britton.
