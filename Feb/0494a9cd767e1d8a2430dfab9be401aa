Of all the Wordle clones that have popped up in recent weeks, Lordle might just be the strangest. Wordle is the daily puzzle game that has taken the world by storm. The aim is to figure out a mystery five-letter word in six guesses or less. The popularity of the game has led to countless copycats appearing online, including an adults-only version called Lewdle, a maths-based version named Nerdle, and now, perhaps strangest of all, a Lord of the Rings daily puzzle titled Lordle. If you've played Wordle in the past, then Lordle should be instantly recognisable. It plays exactly like Wordle, only with one big difference. Instead of trying to figure out any regular five-letter words, Lordle's words are all taken from the pages of Lord of the Rings. "Use only five-letter words (including names) in the main text of Lord of the Rings," reads the official description. One day the answer may be 'Bilbo', while another answer may be 'Gimli', or perhaps 'Arwen'. If you consider yourself a hardcore Lord of the Rings fan, then Lordle should provide a decent challenge. In case you aren't entirely sure of the rules, you'll need to guess the five-letter word within six attempts. For each guess, the letter tiles will show up in one of three colours. If the tile turns grey, the letter does not appear in the word you are guessing. If the tile turns yellow, the letter you guessed is in the word, just not in the correct position. If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word and in the right place. The site keeps track of your statistics, showing the number of correct answers you've managed, and your current winning streak. If you really want a challenge, Wordle even has a hard mode, which can be turned on in the settings.
