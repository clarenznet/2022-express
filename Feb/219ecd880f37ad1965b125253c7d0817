The NAACP awards celebrate outstanding achievements on the part of black and other minority ethnic persons in the arts, with Harry and Meghan themselves honoured with the President’s Award for distinguished public service in relation to issues of racial justice “I think it’s safe to say I come from a very different background to my incredible wife,” Harry said after receiving the award, “yet our lives were brought together for a reason.” “We share a commitment to a life of service,” the Duke continued, “a responsibility to confront injustice and a belief that the most overlooked are often the most important to listen to.” The couple’s public activism has raised criticisms in some quarters, however, Meghan added that she “couldn't be prouder that we're doing this work together.” Past winners of the award include Jennifer Hudson, Samuel L Jackson, and Will Smith In conjunction with NAACP, the Sussexes’ Archewell Foundation will sponsor a new digital award celebrating those who have fostered “transformational change at the intersection of social justice and technology.”
