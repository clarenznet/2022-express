The Lifetime Allowance (LTA) threatens to impact the pension savings of more savers as it will remain frozen for years to come. Britons should familiarise themselves with the allowance to reduce the risk of breaching it. The Lifetime Allowance caps the maximum amount someone can save into their pension without being hit with a tax charge. The tax charge associated with exceeding the LTA could be a hefty one, potentially as high as 55 percent. An individual’s fund is generally tested when they draw their pension, reach age 75, or on death, to determine whether they are under or over the LTA.

This may seem like an insurmountable amount of money for most people to save for retirement, but in fact many Britons who would not consider themselves wealthy could be at risk of brushing up against the limit. Those who have a final salary pension in particular may be at risk of breaching the LTA.

This may mean more people are dragged above the threshold in years to come as wages rise over time. Figures from HMRC have shown an increase in the number of Britons falling foul of the LTA in recent years, and some fear this could worsen as the limit stays at £1,073,100. Some 8,500 pension savers breached the Lifetime Allowance in the 2019/20 financial year. Excess charges paid by Britons were £342million for that period, which represents a 21 percent increase from £283million paid in 2018/19. The LTA is at a significantly lower level than when it was first introduced in the 2006/07 tax year. It was first set at £1.5million and actually increased in subsequent years. The following year it rose to £1.6million, and again to £1.65million by 2008/09. Two more increases followed, taking the LTA to £1.75million by 2009/10 and £1.8million the following year. The £1.8million mark still represents the highest level the allowance has ever been at. However, the LTA was reduced to £1.5million in the 2012/13 tax year and has since continued to drop. It bottomed out at £1million in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 tax years, before eventually improving slightly to today’s level of £1,073,100.
