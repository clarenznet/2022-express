Known as the "bread basket of Europe", UKRAINE is both the world's third largest corn exporter and fourth largest wheat exporter. Russian control of the Black Sea will bring sharp increases to the cost of staples such as bread, cereal, crackers, pancakes and even pizza. Wheat prices went up Â£15 a ton after Putin ordered his invasion while soybeans hit their highest prices since 2012 and corn jumped to an eight-month peak. Since corn and wheat are used for animal feed, it means the cost of flour, meat, dairy and eggs will increase, too. When it comes to minerals, Russia is the world's largest producer of nickel, used for electric car batteries, the world's second largest producer of platinum, and the sixth biggest producer of aluminium and copper.  While energy supplies were left out of Europe's sanctions package, UK gas prices rose by more than 30 per cent as Russia invaded, while oil prices topped $100 a barrel - levels not seen since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. The UK imports only three per cent of its energy from Russia but will still be hit by rises in the EU. Coupled with the April cost of living rises, Russia's actions will increase fuel and food costs. Analysts predict this will all contribute to a 1.5 per cent jump in the UK's consumer price index.
