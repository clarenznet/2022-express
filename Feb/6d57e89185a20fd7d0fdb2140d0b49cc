Kate, Duchess of Cambridge is hoping to further her work with the early years during her trip to Denmark this week. Denmark is considered a world leader when it comes to early years' development, and Kate recently launched The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood here in the UK. The Duchess touched down in Denmark on Tuesday (February 22) and she hasn't wasted any time getting out and about in Copenhagen. She even had a go on a slide at the Lego Foundation PlayLab, joking with the press saying "you stood far enough away!" and adding "In the spirit of where I am, I had to do it".
