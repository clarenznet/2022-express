There is a feeling in the Formula One paddock that Mercedes and Red Bull will both miss out on victory at next month's season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, according to reports. The Silver Arrows will go in search of a record-breaking tenth successive Constructors' Championship title over the course of the new campaign but will likely be tested by their rivals between now and the end of the year. Red Bull will also be looking to go one better than last year by sealing an impressive championship double if Max Verstappen is able to defend his individual crown at the next time of asking.However, it seems as though both teams could be troubled by the likes of Ferrari and McLaren, who impressed at this week's three-day test in Barcelona.Ferrari became the first team to register 400 total laps of running on Friday and regularly topped the timesheets, while the pace of McLaren's all-new MCL36 challenger also turned plenty of heads.Mercedes have dominated the Constructors' Championship standings for the best part of a decade but this year's battle for supremacy now appears to be shaping up as one of the closest in years.There is said to be a sense among those in F1 that a power shift could soon be on the horizon, with next month's Bahrain Grand Prix set to answer plenty of questions about the current state of play.
