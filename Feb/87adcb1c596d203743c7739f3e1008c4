The Prime Minister also said that any Ukrainian settled in the UK would be able to bring their immediate family. The cash will be used to provide vital supplies and help agencies deal with a growing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Medicines, syringes, dressings and wound care packs are among the items that will be supplied on the ground while UK Government humanitarian experts have been sent out to the region. The total amount of UK aid pledged to Ukraine this year is now at £140million. At the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London, Mr Johnson last night called the fightback against Russia “awe-inspiring”. He added: “We are providing all the economic and military support we can to help those Ukrainians risking everything to protect their country.”
