Nowadays Sylvester Stallone is one of the biggest Hollywood stars of all time. The 1980s movie legend is not only known for Rocky, but also Rambo, Demolition Man, and The Specialist to name a few. Before all of that, however, he was just a simple man in Hollywood trying to make ends meet. He had a pregnant wife, Sasha Czack, and no money left in the bank. The future star had a tough decision to make. Stallone had written the script for Rocky but was struggling to find a production company to purchase it from him. He had a few stipulations for the script, as well. He wanted to star in the film as the titular hero, and he wanted full creative control over the final movie. These demands were a little too tough for most companies, so he was left with no income, a baby on the way, and rising rent. In an act of desperation, he went to a local liquor store and started asking people of they wanted to buy his dog for $100. When Stallone eventually found a buyer, he walked away crying. Stallone could only sell his dog for $50, which no doubt made the ordeal even more horrific for the star. He spoke about the event in 2013, saying: "Yeah, I sold my bull mastiff Butkus to a little person. I tied my dog up at the store with a sign that said a hundred bucks. I got $50 from this guy called Little Jimmy." Stallone was absolutely heartbroken that he had to sell his beloved pup - but his tables soon turned.

He remembered: "[Little Jimmy] wanted to fight me and he said he was gonna kill me - he was a crazy little person! I couldn’t fight him - they’d arrest me - so I offered to pay double." Stallone explained he received "several threats" from Little Jimmy before the pair settled on the fee of £3,000 to buy his dog back. He did end up giving Little Jimmy a massive break in his own career, however. Stallone revealed how he gave Little Jimmy a role in Rocky when it was eventually released in 1976. He said: "I ended up putting him in the movie. Do you remember in Rocky, when the little guy goes: 'Hey, did ya win?' and I go: 'What are you, deaf?' and he goes: 'No, I’m short!' That’s him." Rocky is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video now. SOURCE / SOURCE
