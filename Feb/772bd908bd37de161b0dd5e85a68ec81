BANK of England Governor Andrew Bailey may well cringe in years ahead when he remembers advising workers not to ask for big pay rises when the country is in the throes of cost of living turmoil. It is rich for a public servant who is paid Â£575,538 to urge pay restraint. Such utterances will do nothing to lessen the sense that the establishment fails to grasp just how difficult it can be to make ends meet in modern Britain. We should be glad there is a vibrant jobs market in which workers can seek the wages they need and also deserve for their skills and labour. THE stacks of cards sent to the Queen by legions of well-wishers prove that people throughout our increasingly diverse country are united in their admiration for her wonderful 70 years of exceptional service. The Platinum Jubilee celebrations will stir sad memories of the passing of her father, and she will doubtless miss the unique presence of the Duke of Edinburgh by her side. She is the first British monarch to wear the crown for seven decades but her real achievement goes beyond the length of her reign; she has brought true strength, joy, comfort and wisdom to so many of us. Nothing can surpass the gift she is to each and every one of us.
