Haas driver Nikita Mazepin appears to be facing the threat of the sack under extraordinary circumstances ahead of the new Formula One campaign. The American-owned team appear to be facing a number of issues after their pre-season testing schedule was overshadowed by their relationship with Russian firm Uralkali in light of the country's recent invasion of Ukraine. Haas are set to hold meetings over whether their lucrative sponsorship deal with the company will be cut short in the wake of recent developments.Uralkali reached a multi-year agreement to become the team's title sponsor at the start of last season and is part-owned by Russian oligarch Dmitry Mazepin, who is the father of Nikita.The former was reportedly called into a Kremlin meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier this week, with his involvement in funding his son's race seat having been called into questionin the days sinceSteiner has already refused to rule out the possibility of dropping the Uralkali sponsorship deal ahead of the new season in a move that could also see Mazepin replaced by a new driver.With that in mind, Express Sport takes a look at three potential candidates that could step up to succeed the 22-year-old if he is relieved of his duties over the coming weeks. JUST IN: Max Verstappen responds to Lewis Hamilton’s early marker in F1 testing Fittipaldi is probably the best-placed candidate to succeed Mazepin at Haas having served as the team's reserve driver since 2018.Guenther Steiner has already confirmed that Fittipaldi will be his first-choice option in the event of Mazepin being dropped before the start of the new season.He already has F1 experience after replacing the injured Romain Grosjean at the Sakhir Grand Prix in 2020 before keeping his seat for the next race in Abu Dhabi.However, it remains to be seen whether his services will eventually be required if a solution can be found over Mazepin's future in the coming weeks. Haas could also decide to chase a move for Antonio Giovinazzi, who was released by Alfa Romeo at the end of last season.The Italian recently joined Formula E and will also serve as one of two reserve drivers for Ferrari alongside Mick Schumacher over the course of this season.However, it remains to be seen whether the Prancing Horse would stand in Giovinazzi's way if a permanent race seat opens up at Haas.The American team still have strong links with Ferrari, who have continued to supply them with power units in 2022, and could be tempted to enquire about the possibility of snapping him up if Mazepin is dropped.

Many onlookers have suggested that Piastri should already be racing in F1 by now after cruising to the F2 title at his first attempt last year.However, the 20-year-old was denied the chance to make the step up in pre-season and looks set to spend the campaign on the sidelines as an Alpine junior driver.It remains to be seen whether the French outfit would sanction the highly-rated youngster's departure if Haas were to go knocking on the door over the next few weeks.A temporary one-year contract may be an option to consider, though, and would give Piastri a year to find his feet in F1 before a potential move to a race seat with Alpine in 2023.
