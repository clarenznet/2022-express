The original stars of Gladiators look completely different in new snaps taken amid the news that the 1990s Saturday staple will be returning for a new series. Presenter Ulrika Jonsson, referee John Anderson and contenders Helen O’Reilly, Michael Wilson and James Crossley, have all been pictured since the reboot was confirmed. The series will be back for an 11-episode series later in 2023 and will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. It promises a “new generation of superhumans” who will compete in the “ultimate test of speed and strength”. It has not been confirmed whether any of the original stars will reprise their role in the show's comeback.
