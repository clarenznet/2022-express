Tiffani Thiessen was a glamorous pinup when she appeared in 1980s TV favourites Saved By The Bell and Beverly Hills 90210. As the comparison photo of her in a swimsuit from her heyday makes crystal clear, the looks that captured everyone's attention decades earlier have scarcely faded. The 48-year-old could have passed for someone half her age as she posed beside rocks in a stunning beachside photo. She mischievously added to the caption: "When you get caught trying to find a place to pee." Fortunately the giant rocks would no doubt have concealed her and maintained her modesty if she got caught short - and the remote seaside location looked idyllic.
