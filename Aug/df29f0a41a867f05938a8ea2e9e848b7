Kate Garraway, 55, showed up for an appearance on Smooth Radio today clad in a bright pink ribbed maxi dress, as she bravely greeted onlookers with a bright smile. The presenter looked radiant while posing happily for selfies with strangers who recognised her as she wheeled two suitcases down the street. The Good Morning Britain presenter had earlier been reduced to tears live on-air after learning that her documentary Caring for Derek had been shortlisted for a National Television Awards. Courageous Derek has been battling with complications from a severe form of long Covid and has been in and out of hospital since March 2020. Last week he underwent a serious operation after a bout of sepsis caused kidney damage, but Kate has vowed to look after him, no matter what it takes, and is hoping for his eventual recovery.
