The Oscar-winning actor, 84, shared a cheeky social media post from inside a red phone box holding the receiver. His caption, with a wink-face emoji, read: "Put me through to Doctor Who. Need instructions on my next mission..." One fan said: "I support the idea! Welcome to the Tardis." Another said: "A magnificent Doctor or... a formidable adversary." Actor Ncuti Gatwa is taking over from Jodie Whittaker as the new Time Lord next year.
