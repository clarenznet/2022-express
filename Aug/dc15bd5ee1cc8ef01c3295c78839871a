Victoria Beckham, 48, and hubby David, 47, were the picture of serenity as they held hands and cuddled together on a boat. The pair, who have impressed fans with their loved-up marriage for the past 20 years, are determined to let the good times roll this summer. In their latest snap, Victoria had swept her hair up above her head to stay cool in the heat, while she wore a simple black outfit, as David sat beside her, grinning, in a baseball cap and navy blue top. Earlier in the season, the couple enjoyed a coastal trip to Italy and Croatia with daughter Harper, 10 and son Cruz, 17, followed by a trip to Miami. This week, they all headed to Canada for some water sports and a spot of hiking. Victoria and David's son Brooklyn, 23, has been in the USA with his new wife Nicola Peltz. He confirmed to Variety that there was no feud between the two top women in his life - his mother and his wife - after Nicola posted an image of herself in floods of tears on Instagram and the rumour mill started turning.
