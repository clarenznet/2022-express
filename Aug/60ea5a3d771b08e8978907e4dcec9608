  Kate wore a fuchsia pink mini dress with a high neckline and decorative feathers around the sleeves and bottom of the garment. She showed off her long legs in the short frock, accentuating them with some matching pink sky-high stiletto heels. Kate first posed with a fluffy white cat, who looked adorably confused as they looked off in opposite directions. Next, she posed with an extremely fluffy pet pooch, clutching the animal carefully as she held a small purse in her other hand. Lastly, Kate shared a video of herself holding up a second, grey cat as she posed with her similarly glammed-up friend, who was wearing a shiny purple frock.
