Boris Johnson promised “extra cash” for households in September to cope with the increase, most of which will go to the most vulnerable. But the Prime Minister is leaving Downing Street in September, with Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak set to take over when the Tory leadership race finishes. Both candidates have outlined their own plans to address rising energy costs, but none have suggested freeing the price cap so far. Martin Lewis, the founder of moneysavingexpert.com, told BBC Radio 4 that “lives will be lost this winter” without further action from the Government. Much of the increase is due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has seen energy prices rise as countries turn away from buying Russian fuel which is funding Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The conflict has been ongoing for six months already, and although Ukraine is gaining momentum the fighting looks set to continue for some time. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has responded to the latest price increase by suggesting that everyone should look at their energy consumption and look at ways of lowering this before winter. So, what do you think the Tories should do to tackle astronomical energy prices? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
