The Rolling Stones are currently on their SIXTY European tour, to celebrate the band’s 60th anniversary. As the group approach their eighties and with the loss of drummer Charlie Watts last year, it’s incredible to see the tenacity of Mick Jagger, Keith Richard and Ronnie Wood, who are working on new material for an album. Ahead of their gig in Berlin tonight, Keith Richards told Apple Music 1 in their The Rolling Stones: 60th Anniversary Special podcast: “[We’ll] have recorded some stuff by the end of the year. Anyway, I just make records and then we figure out how they come out, right? That’s what I do.” Although the 78-year-old did note he was uncertain if the new songs would be available on streaming platforms. Assuming The Rolling Stones have a new album in the works, it would mark their first studio one since their 2016 blues cover record Blue & Lonesome. In terms of new material, the band haven’t released a full album since 2005’s A Bigger Bang. It would also be their first since Watts died last year. Nevertheless, Richards has confirmed previously that their new drummer Steve Jordan will be part of finishing off a new album.

Richards remembered thinking: “Oh, I cannot do this without Charlie.” But Watts said: “You can do it with Steve. He can take my seat anytime.” The guitarist added: “And he talked me into it. God damn, I loved that man.”
