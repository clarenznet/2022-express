The Home Secretary, speaking after visiting Liverpool yesterday, said she was "appalled" by the shocking surge in violence in the city. The city has been left reeling after nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, 28-year-old Ashley Dale and 22-year-old Sam Rimmer were all shot dead within a week of each other. Organised crime is believed to be behind the spate of killings - prompting renewed concern about how gangs have a stranglehold over the city. Now Ms Patel has allocated £350,000 to expand a pilot scheme tackling serious and organised crime. The Home Secretary also announced £150,000 in mental health support. Ms Patel said: "Express readers will have been as appalled as I was at the spate of violence in Liverpool which has seen three people lose their lives over the past couple of weeks." She added: "Liverpool is a wonderfully vibrant city and I have been struck by the unity and resolve of its people. But I know, and have seen first-hand, the hurt and impact these incidents have had on the community." "It is why I have announced additional funding to provide support and reassurance to the community, building on the £5.9million we have invested this year to tackle the root causes of serious violence in Merseyside through the local Violence Reduction Unit, which brings together key local agencies to run interventions and projects to steer young people away from violence." "We are also going after the callous organised crime groups who are fuelled by greed and have a complete disregard for people's lives and livelihoods." "We will provide £350,000 to expand the Clear, Hold, Build pilot tackling organised criminal gangs across other areas in Merseyside to drive down knife and firearms offences, while improving community resilience and delivering preventative programmes to young people."
