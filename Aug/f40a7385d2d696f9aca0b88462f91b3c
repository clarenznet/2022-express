  Ozzy kept his head down as he left the upmarket hotel wearing a black bowler hat with skull and crossbones embellishment. He wore a black blazer over a black and yellow patterned T-shirt and accessorised with some shades. Sharon held Ozzyâ€™s hand tightly as she led him past the crowd, while Kelly stood beside her dad. Sharon opted for a loose white shirt and light brown slacks, accessorising with two gold necklaces and some huge black sunglasses. Kelly looked glam in a form-fitting black dress with a plunging v-neck, pulling her purple hair into a classic ponytail and matching her mum with some similar black shades.
