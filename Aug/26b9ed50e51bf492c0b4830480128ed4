A Place In The Sun presenter Danni Menzies took to Instagram to document her fun weekend in view of her 103,000 followers. The blonde bombshell donned a festival-appropriate get-up as she made the most of the last of the summer sun. Danni posed up a storm as she donned a pair of black shorts, a cropped t-shirt of the same colour complete with feathers on the shoulders. She added a touch of glam with sequins around her eyes and a pair of heeled cowboy boots. The star branded her outfit "casual" as she relaxed while posing on a blue car.
