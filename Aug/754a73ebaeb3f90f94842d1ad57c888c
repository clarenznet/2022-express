This led to an immediate reaction from the ethnic Serbians, with road blocks set up on two cross-border roads and shots fired, although nobody was hurt. There are fears that violence could flare up once more between ethnic Serbs and Kosovan Albanians some 23 years after the end of the Kosovan War. The background to the antipathy, nay hatred, between Serbians and Kosovan Albanians goes back into the mists of time; suffice to say that according to one of my colleagues who has served there it makes the Troubles in Northern Ireland look like “a picnic in the park”. More recently, when Yugoslavia disintegrated after the death of Tito, part of the upheaval was the war of 1998-99, when Serbian and Montenegran forces fought the Kosovan Liberation Army.After some pretty vicious fighting and atrocities committed by both sides, the war was ended when NATO intervened under UN Security Council Resolution 1224 and initiated a bombing campaign against Serbian forces which forced them to withdraw.At its height, the NATO Kosovo Force, or KFOR as it is commonly known, had some 50,000 personnel committed to the region.After peace was restored there has been a drawdown in troop numbers and NATO now maintains a force of just 4,000 troops there, drawn from 28 nations. Nonetheless, the commander of KFOR has said his command will do “whatever it takes” to maintain stability.The independence of Kosovo is now recognised by a total of 99 out of 193 countries, including the USA, UK, and 22 out of 27 EU countries. Its independence is not recognised, however, by Serbia or its traditional ally, Russia, nor by China.There has been some speculation that Russia could be behind this current spate of border troubles, not just in its historical role as Serbia’s major ally – think of the opening moves of the First World War – but also encouraging the agitation to draw NATO attention away from the Ukraine conflict.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has clearly failed in its initial strategic aims and is now bogged down in a war of attrition in the Donbas and in Kherson. The stubborn and courageous resistance by the Ukrainian forces has been much helped by the modern weaponry and training provided by many NATO countries, the USA, UK, Poland and France among them. The one thing that Putin will want to avoid over Ukraine above all else is direct confrontation with NATO, because he knows that Russia would lose, and lose badly. So anything that might distract the Alliance from its support of the Ukrainian government and armed forces will work to Russia and Putin’s advantage.To an outside observer this must remain speculation at best, at least until firm evidence is presented.There are agencies which will know exactly what’s going on, of course, but until they reveal their information I can only make an informed guess. My personal view is that this most definitely smacks of malign intervention.Be that as it may, the confrontation has now died away and the Kosovan authorities have agreed to delay their move to regulate ethnic Serbians by a month. It will be interesting to see what develops when Kosovo attempts to reintroduce the regulatory measures in September, but we could then witness yet another replay of tension on the border.If that proves to be the case then I very much suspect that the interests of Vladimir Putin and Russia’s secret services will cast their shadow over events as they unfold.Lt Col Stuart Crawford, former army officer, author and broadcaster.
