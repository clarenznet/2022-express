Tyra Banks, 48, looked radiant as she arrived in style to the Day of Indulgence party in LA, thrown by film producer Jennifer Klein. Other celebrity guests in attendance included newlyweds Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz, and Rebel Wilson. Supermodel Tyra showed off her midriff in a black cropped t-shirt tied in a knot, which she paired with some skintight leggings. She wore her hair in tousled waves as she paired her casual look with some black and white Nike trainers. Tyra has fallen under scrutiny in recent years as viewers of America’s Next Top Model, which she hosted from 2003-2018, have begun to recall some of the more problematic moments. Clips have resurfaced showing Sports Illustrated model Tyra branding a contestant named Robin Manning “plus-size” despite her being a slender size six. Janice Dickinson, who served as a judge several times on the programme, called Robin “fat” and “huge”. Other controversial moments included the annual challenge where the models would be made up to look like other races, and Tyra’s emotional rant at eliminated contestant Tiffany Richardson.
