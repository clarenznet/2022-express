Joan Collins, 89, and late sister Jackie, who died from cancer in 2015, had experienced a relationship which was reportedly both fractured and at other times very close. In unearthed snaps, the two can be seen in their younger days enjoying their fame. In one shot, the pair were pictured alongside James Bond star Roger Moore as they could be seen drinking and partying in a close circle of friends. Other photos showed Joan admiring her sister as she wrote while they sat in a garden. The two sisters both enjoyed fame, but were known for different things, with Joan being the recipient of several acting accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, a People’s Choice Award and a Primetime Emmy award. Meanwhile, Jackie was a popular novelist whose books have sold over 500 million copies worldwide. She died from breast cancer after secretly battling the illness for six years, only telling sister Joan she had been diagnosed with cancer two weeks before her death.
