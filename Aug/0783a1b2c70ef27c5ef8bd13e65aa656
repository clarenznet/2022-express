Catherine Zeta-Jones, 52, gave birth to son Dylan when she was 30 - and a series of snaps of herself with him as a baby and toddler captured the special moments they have shared as mother and son. In one photo, Catherine threw her head back in youthful laughter while lying on the grass and stretching her arms up to lift her son skyward. The brown-eyed beauty also pictured herself cuddling her son and interacting with him while his dad, Michael Douglas, looked on fondly. The post was made in celebration of Dylan's 22nd birthday. "Zero to 22! You are everything to me and everything is you," Catherine wrote in her joyous tribute. "The joy you have brought to this world thus far, is immeasurable," she continued, adding affectionately: "I love you more than words can say."
