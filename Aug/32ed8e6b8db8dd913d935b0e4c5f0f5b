Lulu, 73, looked incredible as always, cut in a casual outfit, showing off her youthful side at BFI Southbank in London last night. The Scottish singer looked great in blue jeans, teamed with a grey top and a white denim jacket. She boosted her height with a pair of wedges and was accessorised with gold jewellery. Lulu sported a bronzed makeup look perfectly showing off her youthful complexion, while her blonde tresses fell effortlessly down her face. She was attending a screening for My Old School, a documentary telling the story of Brandon Lee who in 1993 enrolled at McLeod's old school, Bearsden Academy.
