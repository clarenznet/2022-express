Carol Vorderman, 61, was spotted beaming from ear to ear while enjoying the summer views on a river in Lisbon.  The Countdown maths whizz put her enviable hourglass curves on display while getting some exercise on her paddleboard.  Carol opted for a skintight outfit for the excursion, standing out in a bright pink long-sleeved top and navy blue leggings.  The star accessorised with a pair of mirrored sunglasses and seemed to be a natural while soaking up the sun on the Portugal waters.  Carol has been keeping her 233,000 Instagram followers up to date with her break abroad, explaining her decision to cover up more to protect her skin from the sun’s hot rays.  She penned: "Being a bit more careful in the sun nowadays after we all used to sunbathe covered in cooking oil in the 60s and 70s!  “Never heard of sun protection back then. Ha. Ah well."
