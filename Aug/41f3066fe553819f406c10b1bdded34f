Nadia Sawalha has taken to Instagram to mock Kim Kardashian as she reshared a clip with her 519,000 followers ahead of the new The Kardashians trailer. She captioned the tongue in cheek clip: "A repost from last year to celebrate the trailer for the new The Kardashianâ€™s trailer! Head to my stories to find the link to watch our reaction to it!" In the video, the Loose Women panellist pranced around her dressing room in a black fishnet catsuit which showed off her incredible curves as she lip-synced to reality star Kim. The star donned black lingerie underneath the mesh bodysuit, as she humorously told her 519,000 fans: "So these catsuits I always wear as a lining under my dresses. "It really snatches and sucks you in with this power mesh." "It has a zipper up the back and it has a pee hole so you won't have to take it off so many times," the clip ended as Nadia gave the camera dubious look.
