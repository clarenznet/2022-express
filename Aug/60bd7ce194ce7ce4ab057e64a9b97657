Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are among Premier League clubs expected to complete business before the summer transfer window slams shut at 11pm on September 1. Over £1.3billion has been spent in the English top-flight so far, and top spenders Chelsea (£160m) look destined to extend that status further with a few more additions in Thomas Tuchel's sights. The Blues are in talks over Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Wesley Fofana and are challenging United for his Barcelona teammate Frenkie de Jong.

Barca boss Xavi Hernandez has also provided an update on De Jong's situation as his whirlwind summer saga nears its judgement day.
