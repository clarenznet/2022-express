Prince Harry and Meghan are set to return to the UK next month. The Duke has previously stressed his concerns, as a non-working royal, over lack of security and has since launched two lawsuits against the UK Home Office. Speaking on Talk TV, royal expert Angela Levin has criticised the couple's calls for security and claims that as "non-working royals", they have "no right" to "demand" it. Ms Levin said: "They are not working royals. "He has no right to demand protection." She noted that due to the current crisis in the rising living costs, his demands are "unfair on us". This is especially as "he is going to make money out of it".

In March, Harry didn't return to the UK, from his current home in the US, due to his ongoing fears over security. Meghan was pregnant with their second child at the time. Neither the Duke nor the Duchess of Sussex released any statement ahead of the memorial service.

His fears led him to launch a case against the Home Office. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Harry had filed a second lawsuit against them. DON'T MISS Their pending return was planned so the couple could visit a few charity events "close to their hearts", including the WellChild Awards on September 8. Last week, royal biographer Omid Scobie claimed that protection for the Royal Family is "as important as ever", especially as the Sussexes have received an "astonishingly high" number of threats. He added that the fears that Harry has are not "rooted in paranoia". READ NEXT:
