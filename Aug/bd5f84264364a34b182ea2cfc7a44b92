Sir Tom Jones dazzled as he attended ITV's Autumn Entertainment Launch alongside his The Voice co-stars while sporting a very blue outfit. The Welsh hitmaker, 82, looked dapperÂ in a navy pair of trousers which he paired with a baby blue shirtand ever more blue trainers. Tom appeared to be in good spirits as he struck a series of poses both alone and with his co-stars. He wore a series of gold rings along with a bracelet and watch. The star posed for snaps alongside Emma Willis, Olly Murs and Anne-Marie ahead of the show's return on Saturday.
