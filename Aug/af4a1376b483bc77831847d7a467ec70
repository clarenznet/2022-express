While the shadow turned out to be nothing to be worried about, James McAvoy's wound from the biopsy surgery became grotesquely infected. Consequently, the original out-patient appointment turned into a three-week stint in hospital. "It nearly killed me," the Glaswegian actor told Men's Journal. "It was very scary.

"Other rare, but serious, complications of surgical lung biopsies may include severe bleeding, wound infection, and blood clots," Doctor DerSarkissian added. People who have undergone a biopsy should alert their doctor immediately if they experience any of the following: Medical intervention can lead to a full recovery post operation, just like McAvoy did. Since his life-threatening ordeal, McAvoy has gone on to complete numerous projects. From the likes of The Bridge TV series to the 2022 comedy, The Bubble, the BAFTA award-winning star may have many more years to delight his fans with new work.
