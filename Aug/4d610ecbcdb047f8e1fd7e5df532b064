The sun-kissed couple looked relaxed on a boat trip from the Aegean island of Evia. In one shot, the toppled Tory Prime Minister, 58, grins as he drapes his arm around Carrie, 34, at Marmari harbour. He looks a world away from high-office pressures in a white T-shirt, black shorts, trainers and sporting blond stubble.  Meanwhile, Mr Johnson might be pleased to find out he still has the backing of a significant number of Conservatives, with a new poll showing many prefer him over Tory leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. A fresh YouGov survey indicated Tory voters have "seller's remorse" over the ousting of Mr Johnson. According to the poll, published by The Sunday Times, Conservative supporters would rather have Mr Johnson remain in No10 than back Ms Truss and Mr Sunak to become Prime Minister combined. Some 49 percent of Tories believe Mr Johnson should stay as Prime Minister, compared with 20 percent for the former Chancellor and 18 percent for the Foreign Secretary. In Greece, Mr Johnson was seen leaving a generous €50 euro tip after enjoying a fish dinner at a beachside café. Then, he posed with two Ukrainian staff for a selfie, assuring them the UK would continue to back them in their defence against the Russians. On that matter, Downing Street said it would be a big week for the outgoing leader, as Ukraine is high up on the Prime Minister's agenda. Mr Johnson is expected to hold calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the coming days, and No10 and the Foreign Office are expected to mark Ukraine Independence Day — the celebration of the nation's freedom from the Soviet Union — on Wednesday.
