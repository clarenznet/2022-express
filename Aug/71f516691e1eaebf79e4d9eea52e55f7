MPs are calling for the regulation of fillers as currently there is no mandatory training required to carry out the work. Carol opened up on the ITV daytime talk show about how she previously had a face lift. The show then cut to a photo of Carol with highly enhanced facial features, reports The Liverpool Echo. The panelist explained: "I haven't had all of that work done what is shown in the picture." She added: "That is a very disturbing look for me. It's an app or a filter or something that my friend used to see what I would look like if I went too far." Carol said: "What's worrying about that app is that that is a look that some people aspire to. "When you don't have this sort of thing regulated everyone can just get it. So many young people are getting it and aspiring to a look." She added: "I think, not prescription you don't need to get it on prescription, but there should be definitely more regulation I think. "I think there should be an age limit and consultations for people to make sure they haven't got any dysmorphia." Denise Welch asked fellow host Katie Piper if she thought these women having cosmetic procedures were "superficial" due to Katie having to have reconstructive surgery after a terrible incident. She replied: "Short answer is no I don't. I think it's such a complex thing." She added: "Had I not been burnt and I had aged I might have had treatments, I might have gone on to do things like that as I got older. So no, I don't judge you for it and I think that's the key here." Katie said that while she isn't "anti-treatment" she does agree that there should be regulations for Botox and fillers. She explained how the beauticians don't have the power to prescribe antibiotics if the client suffers an infection due to the treatments and they don't have the correct training to deal with adverse reactions.
