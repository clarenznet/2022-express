The Horniman Museum in southeast London will hand back its 72 Benin Bronzes, held in Britain for more than a century, after a unanimous decision by trustees. The sculptures, created from at least the 16th century onwards in the West African Kingdom, were among thousands taken during the British assault on Benin City in 1897. The move is the first by a UK government-funded museum to say it will give back its haul from Benin, which is now in Edo state, Nigeria. And it raises questions about the future of objects held in other collections, not least the disputed Elgin Marbles at the British Museum. Dr Nick Merriman, Horniman chief executive, said the collection will be transferred to Nigeria after a request from its government. The move followed consultation with museum members, local Nigerians, independent experts and even youngsters. Dr Merriman said: "Quite a few children wrote to us. They all felt, in the way that small children are very clear about morals, they should be returned." Roger Michel, from the Institute for Digital Archaeology which has made unauthorised copies of the Elgin Marbles, said: "These are things that have special meaning to these cultures. They need to go back. This is a real turning point." Arts minister Lord Parkinson said it was not up to the Government to "tell museums what a right or wrong decision is". He said any claims should be made "case by case, item by item".
