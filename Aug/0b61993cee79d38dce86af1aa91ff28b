Car salesman Chris Oxley, 40, obstructed the Thames Water vehicle with his own car after his High Wycombe home was cut off because of a reported leak in the road's pipes. His partner Sarah McCrory, 43, drove 20 miles to her mother's house to wash their nine-month-old baby's clothes, bottles and food utensils. Mr Oxley felt he had to “force the situation” with the van after the taps ran dry at 7pm on Monday and an engineer arrived but failed to fix the leak. The Thames Water van arrived carrying water on Wednesday morning and Mr Oxley asked to speak to the driver’s manager when he was unable to answer when the pipes would be fixed. When the driver insisted this would not be possible, Mr Oxley said he “forced the situation” and blocked in the van with his own car. Mr Oxley alleged the driver responded with "f*** you" and an obscene gesture before the driver called the police on him. The police arrived on the scene and, as is laid out in the Highway Code, advised Mr Oxley to move his car, which he then did. Ms McCrory said: “After we suffered abuse from the engineer and then no water for so long, they called the police on us.” “'I'm feeling at my utter, absolute wits end.  I'm desperate. I've been in tears on the phone to people [Thames Water] who just won't help”. “It's all made me very anxious. It's given me a real hit of anxiety. In the past I've suffered with anxiety and while it's been fine now, this has set it off again." “I just feel helpless. There's the promise of water every time yet no water turns up.” Ms McCrory and Mr Oxley claimed nearly two million litres of water has been lost so far in the leak on their road alone. Thames Water said nearly a quarter (24 percent) of all water it supplies leak through cracks. There is growing pressure for water firms to clamp down on creaky infrastructure while their bosses receive millions of pounds in pay packets. Thames Water has been contacted for a comment.
