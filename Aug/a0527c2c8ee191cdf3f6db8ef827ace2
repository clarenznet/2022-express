The two great-grandmas, from Stockport, had a surprise party with their families. And they recalled growing up in the town south of Manchester. When they were just eight they would go down to the railway lines to look for coal that had fallen off trains, so they could light the fire at home. "We didn't have much, we were very poor," they said. But they also recalled fun times, playing out on the streets and being mischievous. Elma laughed: "We would knock on doors and run off." At 14 the sisters, who had three other siblings, landed jobs as packers with Smiths crisps and stayed there until they both married aged 21.
