Crews from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service with three fire engines and a dedicated wildfire vehicle are still trying to put out the fire in Wharncliffe Woods, Oughtibridge, that broke out on Sunday afternoon.  "It’s estimated around 20,000 square metres of woodland has been on fire. "The fire is largely surrounded and under control but it’s a large area, so crews will likely be there all day."
