Opponents of Britain's exit from the European Union took to social media to blame Brexit for the state of the British economy. Marco Gundermann of the University of Northampton tweeted: "The Bank of England forecasts a deep recession in the UK and weak growth after that. This is not forecast for any other G20 country, bar Russia. It’s the result of the government’s policies, the late rise in interest rates and Brexit." Podcast presenter Neil Perryman added: "Rising inflation, rising interest rates and a recession on the horizon. It's a good job Brexit is a massive success or we'd be in trouble." Journalist and author Ian Fraser said: "The fantasies of Brexit Britain are over: Economically stagnant, socially fragmented and politically adrift, the country is being cut down to size.. High energy prices, runaway inflation, struggling exports and rising interest rates are a perfect storm." The claims came after the Bank of England warned the UK would fall into its longest recession since the financial crisis and inflation will peak at 13 percent in the wake of soaring energy prices. The Bank's forecasters expect CPI inflation to hit 13.3 percent in October if regulator Ofgem raises the price cap on energy bills to around £3,450. The Bank hiked the base rate 50 percentage points from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent in a bid to restrain runaway inflation.  FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
