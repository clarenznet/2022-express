The New York Times ran a comment piece by politics and culture commentator Richard Seymour titled "The Fantasy of Brexit Britain Is Over". Describing Britain in the wake of Covid and Boris Johnson's resignation, Mr Seymour said: "Economically stagnant, socially fragmented and politically adrift, the country is being cut down to size. The right’s Brexit fantasy — of a revitalized Britain, freed from the shackles of Europe and able once again to confidently assert itself at home and abroad — is finished." His article was met with fury from the right, who branded it "stupid" and "ignorant". Former aide to Margaret Thatcher Nile Gardiner said: "Stupid and monumentally ignorant anti-Brexit propaganda from the left-wing New York Times, which is obsessed with bashing Britain."
