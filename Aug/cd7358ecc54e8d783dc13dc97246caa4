Beijing vowed to continue "to train and prepare for war" and said it would "resolutely crush any form of Taiwan independence" as tension with Taipei grows. A delegation of US politicians, including Democrat Senator Ed Markey, Democrat Representatives John Garamendi, Alan Lowenthal and Don Beyer and Republican Representative Aumua Amata, visited for talks with Taiwanese leaders on security, trade, supply chains and other issues.  Previous Chinese military exercises were launched after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived on the island on August 2. She was the first Speaker to visit the island in 25 years but it sparked fury from China. Taiwan's defence ministry said 15 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait again yesterday. Mainland China's ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China. The exercises were a "stern deterrent to the United States and Taiwan continuing to play political tricks and undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait", China's defence ministry said.
