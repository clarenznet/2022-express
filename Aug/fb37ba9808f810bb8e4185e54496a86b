  Christina looked incredible as she put on an explosive performance on Tuesday for the opening night of her UK tour, which also travels to Liverpool, London and Brighton. The singer stunned in a silver, metallic fitted leotard, which included studded detailing and a corset-style back. She wore a black mesh, long-sleeved top beneath the garment and covered her legs with some black, vinyl styled thigh-high boots. The star finished the look with a pair of oversized shades and put her platinum blonde hair in a high ponytail.
