Julia Fox is well known for her outrageous dress sense, having once stripped off at a Californian supermarket to use her jeans as a handbag instead of wearing them on her legs. However, she surpassed herself with yesterday's outfit, in which she donned a black latex outfit with so many cut-outs that it was abundantly clear she was neither wearing a bra nor pants. Her cleavage spilled out of the off-the-shoulder top section, while the bottom half tied around her thighs with little more than silver metallic wiring and a tiny strip of latex. The leggy 32-year-old's frame was accented by a pair of see-through perspex heels, which had a black tint to match the rest of the outfit. Her derriere was barely covered by the skimpy material although, unusually, the violin tattoo she wears on the back of her waist was firmly under wraps yesterday, making it one of the few parts of her body that remained fully covered. Julia currently works as an actress, and will soon appear in The Trainer alongside Bella Thorne, Vito Schnabel and Gina Gershon.
