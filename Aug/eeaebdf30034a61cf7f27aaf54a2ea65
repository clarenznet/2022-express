Kaya Scodelario, 29, channelled vampish glamour as she posed in a cleavage-boosting, strapless satin dress. The gown featured a sequin section at the bust and a long slit up one side from thigh to toe, concealed by a sheer lace section with a floral pattern. The Skins actress accessorised it simply with a chic black satin purse and matching strappy sandals. Meanwhile, Benjamin stood by her side proudly wearing a grey pinstripe suit and black and white striped tie. The pair welcomed a baby girl together earlier this year - the pair's second child, following the birth of their son five years earlier.
