Line of Duty fans were over the moon to see some of the show’s best loved stars reunite today as they marked ten years since the police drama burst onto our screens. AC-12’s Vicky McClure, 39, Martin Compston, 38, and Adrian Dunbar, 64, posed for a photo with producer Simon Heath and writer Jed Mercurio on Tuesday. The DI Kate Fleming actress posted the snap on Instagram, writing: “Happy Ten Years Line of Duty!! “Never lost on me what this show has done for us all and the great people we’ve worked with along the way! “Big love LOD!!!” Martin, who plays DI Steve Arnott, also shared the post and added: “Celebrating ten years with this team”. Fans couldn’t help but wonder if this meant a seventh series was on the cards. Littlelittlewood commented: “Talking about another series of LOD??” “Whoo is there a series 7” asked Gemma. “What are you guys planning? Xxxx” wondered Laura.
