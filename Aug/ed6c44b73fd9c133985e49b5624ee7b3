Brooklyn Beckham, 23, is known for his inks and he couldn't help but get a new one dedicated to his beloved wife Nicola Peltz, 27. David and Victoria Beckham's son took to his Instagram story to unveil the statement tattoo while enjoying a date night in Los Angeles. In the snap, Brooklyn flashed his bold new body art to the camera, on the side of his hand. Across his hand to his wrist, the wannabe chef has proudly had the word "Married" inked. Supportive husband Brooklyn captioned the snap, which comes after Nicola broke down in an emotional Instagram post at the weekend: "Surprised my baby @nicolaannepeltzbeckham."
