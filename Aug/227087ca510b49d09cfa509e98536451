Victoria Beckham, 47, reposted her son Cruz's Instagram photo featuring himself in a signed Spice Girls tee - and made sure that her emoji version of herself stuck with the Spice Girls theme by posing with a peace sign. The singer-turned-style icon, who is also a fashion designer, added in the caption that Cruz was "looking good". He had shared a mirror selfie wearing a shirt which featured each of the Spice Girls photographed for their 1996 album, Spice. It comes as rumours have circulated about a supposed feud between Victoria and Brooklyn's wife Nicola Peltz, 27. Speculation was amped up when Nicola posted footage of herself in floods of tears in bed.
