Pictures show the road cordoned off near Clapham Common Underground station, with sniffer dog units on the scene. Reports suggest there are were at least six officers present as of 1.30pm this afternoon (Friday).  Footage shows that at least two police cars and a police dog van were in attendance. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the package was spotted outside the nearby Post Office on the south London high street. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said that the incident was now over. In a statement, they said: "Police were called at about 12:30hrs on Friday, 12 August to reports of a possible suspicious package outside a premises in Clapham High Street, SW4.   "A number of road closures and cordons are in place while officers responded. "The item was assessed as non-suspicious and the incident was stood down shortly before 13:45hrs." The cordon appears to have sectioned the road off to the public just before the junction with Clapham Park Road (A2217), encircling the Post Office.   Clapham High Street was then cut off before the intersection with Stonehouse Street. Traffic monitors suggest that just after 2pm the cordon had been lifted and traffic allowed to pass. A Transport for London spokesperson said that Clapham Common station has remained open, but Clapham High Street overground station was briefly closed due to the incident.
