Mikel Arteta hopes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gets a good reception from Arsenal supporters if he joins Chelsea. Aubameyang left the Gunners in acrimonious circumstances in January but could be making a swift return to the Premier League. The striker was stripped of the captaincy at Arsenal by Arteta last December following a string of disciplinary breaches. Aubameyang was axed from the first-team picture and eventually left the club to join Barcelona after having his contract terminated. Supporters have been given a behind-the-scenes look at the situation which led to his departure from the Emirates in Amazon's Arsenal: All or Nothing documentary. Arteta took a firm stance on his former skipper in banishing him from his team. Chelsea are linked with signing Aubameyang following the departures of forwards Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner this summer. And Arteta hopes the former Gabon international is welcomed by his old supporters if he does return to the Emirates as a Blues player.
