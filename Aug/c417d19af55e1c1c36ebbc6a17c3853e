Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg defended for her widely criticised remarks, heard in an audio recording leaked last week. Mr Rees-Mogg praised Ms Truss, regarded as the frontrunner to win the Tory leadership and replace Boris Johnson as PM, as "sensible", hitting out at what he called "confected political criticism" of the Foreign Secretary.

During the recording, Ms Truss also tried to explain the lower productivity seen outside London as being due to "a mindset and attitude thing", in the comments from recent years. Labour said Ms Truss's remarks made while she was a Treasury minister were "grossly offensive", saying that she had effectively branded British workers "lazy". But Mr Rees-Mogg told the Mail on Sunday: "Liz Truss's sensible comments about poor productivity in the British economy attracted confected political criticism but they reflect an unfortunate reality in much of the British state. "This is not good for the Government, or for the public as a whole." Speaking while chief secretary to the Treasury, a role she held between 2017 and 2019, Ms Truss said: "What needs to happen is more graft. It's not a popular message."
