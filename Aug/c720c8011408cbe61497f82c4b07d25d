Heidi Klum sparked a frenzy as she put on an extremely busty display as she arrived to film America's Got Talent. The supermodel, 49, donned a midi-length white summer dress which showcased her ample assets. The stunning garment featured a deep v-shaped neckline which the model risked spilling out of. Heidi appeared to be in good spirits as she arrived at the studios and accessorised with a matching pair of white sunglasses and oversized handbag. The star wore her highlighted blonde locks in a straight style and her flawless tan was accentuated by the colour of her dress.
