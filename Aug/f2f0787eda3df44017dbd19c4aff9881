Sharon Osbourne, 69, looked very glam as she left her London hotel last night to film her TalkTV chat show. She looked radiant in a stylish black two-piece suit, paired with an open blouse. Sharon extenuated her youthful complexion with a natural makeup palette and wore her red tresses in her usual cropped style. The former X Factor judge recently supported her husband Ozzy Osbourne, 73, as he took to the stage at the Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony at Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. This comes after the rocker was diagnosed with Parkinsons' disease two years ago - but he put on an energetic performance in front of delighted fans.
