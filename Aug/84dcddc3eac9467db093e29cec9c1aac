The Queen has snubbed her grandson Prince Harry when paying tribute to Prince Charles and Prince William for their climate activism. In a message to the Lambeth Conference on Wednesday, the Queen said she was proud of her son and eldest grandson for continuing the legacy of her late husband Prince Philip - but there was no mention of the Duke of Sussex. The Queen said: "[Climate change is] threatening the lives and livelihoods of many people and communities, not least the poorest and those less able to adapt and adjust. "I was interested to learn that the focus of your program at Lambeth Palace today is reflection and dialogue on the theme of the environment, a cause close to the heart of my late husband, and carried on by The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Cambridge.” Prince Harry’s climate change activism appears to have gone deliberately unnoticed by the monarch, even with his recent public statements on the matter. Prince Harry gave a speech at the United Nations on July 18 in which he said climate change was "wreaking havoc" on our planet and called on world leaders to act now to "save humanity."
