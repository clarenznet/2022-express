Russia is launching sweeping military drills with China to demonstrate increasingly close defence ties amid the horrific ongoing war in Ukraine. The Vostok 2022 (East 2022) exercise will be held September 1-7 in various locations in Russia’s Far East and the Sea of Japan and involve more than 50,000 troops and 5,000 weapons units, including 140 aircraft and 60 warships, according to the Russian defence ministry. The ministry said units of Russian airborne troops, long-range bombers, and military cargo planes will take part in the drills along with other forces.

The developments have sparked fears that Moscow and Beijing could develop a formal military alliance. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
