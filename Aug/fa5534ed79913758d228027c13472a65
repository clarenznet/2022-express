Investigations by the Home Office revealed 365 marriages between an EU and a non-EU national were a sham. But none of those involved have been removed in the past two years and none have been prosecuted for four years. The Home Office maintained it would not hesitate to take enforcement action against anyone caught in a sham marriage but admitted there had been fewer investigations during the Covid pandemic. In 2018, the EU Settlement Scheme said EU citizens and their non-EU spouses were eligible to apply to stay once the UK formally left the EU. Crime gangs helped people into sham marriages so people could “cheat the system” and circumvent Britain’s immigration rules. By entering into a marriage, the EU citizens’ residency rights were extended to their non-EU bogus partner. Some individuals do it for money. Dr Ervin Muco, in Albania, said: “These networks know how to cheat the system and they are making money from people who are prepared to pay.” Former police chief Prof Krenar Ahmeti, at the University of Tirana, said: “Anyone aspiring to live in a wealthy country knows that there are certain key documents they need if they are going to integrate into that society.” But the Home Office said: “As the public rightly expects, we take abuse of the spouse-and-partner immigration routes very seriously. “We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against individuals found to be in a sham marriage or civil partnership, including cancelling their leave and removing them from the UK.”
