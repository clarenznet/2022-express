One guest could not hold back her strong thoughts on Meghan Markle when speaking to James Whale on his TalkTV show James Unleashed. During a phone segment, the woman slammed the host for defending Meghan before things got heated. Sitting next to his co-star Ash Gould, they both introduced caller Susan to the show who was calling from Bognor Regis.The caller instantly shared her negative thoughts on Meghan Markle as she claimed the Duchess has "ruined the Royal Family".Addressing the TalkTV host, she fumed: “What she’s done to our Royal Family! James, I cannot understand why you defend her.”James went on to tell Susan she had "no idea what she was talking about" before starting to ask how she knew the Duchess had ruined the royals.   The TalkTV host then asked why she was speaking about them as if she knows them personally before he hit back saying she does not know what she’s talking about.James told Susan what she has been reading in the paper about Meghan is not necessarily true, although defending her opinions she quipped back that she does not read the media, but has formed her opinions based on what she can see. The host fumed: “You can’t see at all! You’re talking rubbish!” However, Susan was not listening as she continued to slam Meghan claiming she’s not who she says she is.   Sharing his insight, Ash added there is not smoke without fire and mentioned the Duchess has "cut off her own father".James questioned why that mattered before sharing his own clear views on Thomas Markle. Susan said James' comments on her father were nasty before mentioning that he paid for her education. Agreeing, Ash added Thomas made her who she was.James fumed: “You have no idea! You are just giving your opinion from what you have read which could be completely wrong and that’s what annoys me.”James Whale Unleashed is available on TalkTV every Thursday to Saturday at 10pm
