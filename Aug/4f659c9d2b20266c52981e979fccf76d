George, nine, never got to meet his grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. However, the future King and his siblings, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, four, pay tribute to their late grandmother each year. Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge’s children have penned touching messages to remember Diana. George’s sister Charlotte’s message referenced their father Prince William, Princess Diana’s son. She wrote: “Dear Granny Diana. I am thinking of you on Mother’s Day. “I love you very much. Papa is missing you. Lots of love Charlotte xxxxxxxxx.” She wrote her message on a bright pink card decorated with a large, hand-drawn heart and stickers. Meanwhile, Louis, who was just two years old at the time, signed his own card: “From Louis.” His tribute to Diana on a green card also featured a multi-coloured heart and several animal stickers. The Cambridges’ Twitter post revealing the tributes was accompanied with a touching message. It read: “Each year on Mother’s Day, George, Charlotte and Louis make cards remembering their Granny, Diana, for William. “Whatever your circumstances, we are thinking of you this Mother’s Day.” When Diana died 25 years ago, she left behind two children, Prince Harry and Prince William, both from her marriage to Prince Charles.

In 1997, Diana’s death prompted a huge outpouring of global grief across Britain and around the world. The Princess died after the car she was travelling in, driven by Henri Paul, crashed inside a tunnel in Paris. Paul is understood to have lost control of the vehicle before it crashed into a concrete pillar in the tunnel. He and Diana’s rumoured boyfriend, Egyptian billionaire Emad ‘Dodi’ Fayed, who was also in the car, were pronounced dead at the scene. Diana was still alive, although she had suffered multiple injuries, but after being rushed to hospital, doctors were unable to save her. Diana’s British bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones was the only survivor of the crash.
