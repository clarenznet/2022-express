Yulia Paievska, 53, said she “cried from emotions” when the Duke of Sussex’s call came in, only a few days after she was released from three-month captivity. Paievska was captured and tortured by Russian soldiers in March when she rushed to help people trapped at a shelled Ukrainian theatre, as she was volunteering as a paramedic. She told the Telegraph of her conversation with Prince Harry: “He simply inspired me to continue to fight.” Adding he had spoken so “strongly and sincerely” about Ukraine that compelled her to keep helping people. Ms Paievska had been training to compete at the Invictus Games, founded by the Prince, in swimming, archery and powerlifting, before the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. After her capture, her 19-year-old daughter, Anna-Sofia Puzanova, competed in her place in archery and won a bronze medal. Ms Puzanova then spoke of her mother’s detention to Prince Harry, who then came in touch with Paievska. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
