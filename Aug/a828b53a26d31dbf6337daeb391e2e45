It will cause a “significant humanitarian crisis with thousands of lives lost and millions of children’s development blighted”, warns a hard-hitting new report. And a generation of children will suffer from a “toxic stress” which could lead to brain and lung damage. As many as 15 million people, making up 55 per cent of families, will be unable to pay their energy bills from January 2023 unless they receive significant help, according to the latest Marmot Review. Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity, urged the “Government to act right now.” He said: “It’s clear we are facing a significant humanitarian crisis with thousands losing their lives and millions of children’s development blighted, leading to inequalities that will last a lifetime. "Warm homes, nutritious food and a stable job are vital building blocks for health. In addition to the effect of cold homes on mental and physical illness, living on a low income does much damage.  If we are constantly worrying about making ends meet it puts a strain on our bodies, resulting in increased stress, with effects on the heart and blood vessels and a disordered immune system.” Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said: “This report backs up our worst fears.” A household is in fuel poverty if they are on a low income but high energy prices force them below the official breadline of 60 per cent of the average income after housing costs. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition predicts that 6.7 million households are currently in fuel poverty in the UK (23.6 per cent of all households). This is likely to rise when the latest energy price cap lifts again in October to £3,549.
