Flight FR2347 took off from Newcastle Airport at around 8.50am on Tuesday and was flying near Toulouse in France when passengers reported "smelling burning", according to Chronicle Live. Passengers were on board the flight heading to Palma de Mallorca Airport in Spain when the plane was forced to divert. Fire crews met the plane on the tarmac when it was grounded at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. Ryanair said the flight was diverted due to a "minor technical issue". A spokeswoman said the airline had arranged an "alternative aircraft" to bring passengers to Palma "later today". She said: "This flight from Newcastle to Palma (16 Aug) diverted to Toulouse due to a minor technical issue with the aircraft. "To minimise disruption to passengers, we have arranged for an alternative aircraft to bring them to Palma later today.  "Affected passengers have been notified and provided with refreshment vouchers. "Ryanair sincerely apologises to all affected passengers.”
