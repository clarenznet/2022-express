President Ludvik Svoboda was being held in his castle surrounded by Russians yet that night spoke on the radio condemning the invasion. 59 years ago (1963) thieves ambushed the Glasgow to Euston mail train in Buckinghamshire at 3.15am, beating driver Jack Mills over the head and making off with £2.6million in used banknotes in what became known as the Great Train Robbery. The Post Office train - known as the Up Special - had run every night without any problems for 125 years. 48 years ago (1974) Richard Nixon announced he would step down as president, the first US leader to do so. Nixon was facing impeachment and potential removal from office over the Watergate scandal and subsequent cover-up which implicated him in a break-in at the Democratic Party HQ before the 1972 election.
