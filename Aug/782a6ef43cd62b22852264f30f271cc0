The birds, who have made their home on the Bolton Castle estate in Wensleydale, have produced two chicks - a male and a female. Sacha Dench, who is tracking the migration route to Africa, praised Tom Orde-Powlett, son of Lord Bolton, who created the Yorkshire Dales nesting site.  Two platforms were built to try to tempt the birds to stay. Ms Dench said: "What Tom and his colleagues have achieved is nothing short of a miracle."
