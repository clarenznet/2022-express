Madonna, 63, has stunned fans in her latest Instagram posts as she shared a series of eye-popping photos for her 18.4 million followers. The entertainer looked sensational in a white bustier. She teamed the corset with a chic blue tracksuit and white boots. At one point, the star measured her own temperature with a thermometer. In another, she posed coquettishly for snaps while laid out on a bed. Madonna also made a statement with the word Thief written in silver on her purse. She then posted the caption: “Makes no sense” in reference to a Baby Keem song, which could be heard playing in the background.
