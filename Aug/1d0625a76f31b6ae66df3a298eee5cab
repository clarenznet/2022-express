Reasons for these little treats include having a tough day at work, celebrating payday, or it simply being the weekend. And nearly one in five (18 percent) will reward themselves for stepping out of their comfort zone – while one in 20 (four percent) do so simply to post about it on social media. Over half (53 percent) feel happy, 47 percent feel content, and 25 percent feel calmer after treating themselves. But 45 percent admitted they are treating themselves less at the moment, due to the cost-of-living crisis. However, almost a third (29 percent) reckon people shouldn’t feel guilty for doing something to cheer themselves up or give themselves a boost. More than half (57 percent) also feel positive after treating someone else. And two-thirds agreed they get a “magical” feeling when they receive an unexpected treat from a loved one or friend. The research was commissioned by comparethemarket.com, which teamed up with Caffe Nero to offer customers 25 percent off coffee and pastries, twice a day, seven days a week. Julie Daniels, spokeswoman for the price comparison site, said: “Everyone deserves to feel a little boost – a treat can perk us up when we’re low, or elevate an already good day into a great one.” Among the most regular treats for Brits were consumable goods – such as a coffee (22 percent), a chocolate bar (41 percent), or a meal out (14 percent). A further one in five (21 percent) enjoy something material, including clothes (12 percent) or a video game (16 percent). The “glow” of a treat typically lasts for several hours, according to a third (34 percent) of those polled, via OnePoll – although 26 percent reckon they’ll get a thrill for days as a result. And although many may be being more cautious of their spending due to the current cost-of-living crisis, one in three (32 percent) have still treated themselves within the past week, and 22 percent in the past month.
