Ukraine's state nuclear power company, Energoatom, warned the strikes had hit "directly on the site" of the Zaporizhzhia plant nearby to the reactor. The Kyiv Independent reported there was a high risk of a radioactive leak at the plant. It said: "There is a high risk of fire, as well as hydrogen and radioactive leakage, according to the operator. "On Aug. 5, the plant shut down one of the three operating power units as Russia continues to 'terrorize and endanger the entire civilized world,' the statement [from Enerogoatom] reads." The news comes following reports of a strike at the facility earlier today which severed a high voltage cable. The earlier strike prompted the plant's operators to shut down one reactor despite no leak being detected. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the earlier strike.
