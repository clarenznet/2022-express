Turkey and the UN helped broker a deal in Istanbul last week giving safe passage to vessels carrying wheat out of three southern Ukrainian ports. It is hoped the move will ease the global food crisis and reduce grain prices, that have rocketed since the Russian invasion began.  While routes are expected to re-open, Ukraine's harvest may be half its usual amount this year due to the war. President Volodymyr Zelensky said: "Ukrainian harvest this year is under threat to be twice less. Our main goal - to prevent global food crisis caused by the Russian invasion."
