Kate recently took a break from GMB after her husband’s health declined once more. She addressed the terrifying health scare on her first show back, revealing that Derek had developed a kidney infection that led to some dangerous complications. She explained that he had contracted “life-threatening sepsis”.       While Derek has been moved out of intensive care and is now in the hospital's high-dependency unit, he is also now at risk of losing one of his kidneys. As Kate explained to ITV viewers this morning, Derek had been in and out of hospital with minor health problems until July 9.

So it was really dramatic.” Kate praised the medical staff looking after her husband, explaining how they needed to find the source of infection quickly in order to give Derek the right antibiotics. She continued: “His blood pressure was so low. A really junior doctor said, ‘What did you think it might be?’ “He knew it wasn't Covid-19 because we tested before we left the hospital on the Thursday.       “I said, ‘Well I did wonder if it was a urine infection, but weirdly we couldn't get anything for a sample.’ And they just went, ‘Kidneys’.” “Unfortunately, his kidneys were really badly infected, blocked. The challenge now is to save them. So that's where we've been for the last three weeks.” Kate and Derek have been married since 2005 and share two children: Darcey, 16, and William, 13. Good Morning Britain airs every day from 6am on ITV.
