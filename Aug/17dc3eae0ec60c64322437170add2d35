With the warm summer weather set to stay for a while, John Lewis has your outfit needs covered. The midi dress has been popular since shoppers have spotted it on the John Lewis website. When looking for an outfit that can take you from day to night, this dress ticks all the boxes. The midi length is versatile and can be dressed up with boots or heeled sandals for special occasions, or dressed down with trainers for a casual look. The piece will set you back £49, but due to its popularity it is currently only available in a size 8 – but expect a restock soon on other sizes. The website describes the dress, ''Finery's long-sleeved classic tea dress combines understated elegance with an eye-catching print. Made from a soft-touch fabric, the fitted top is buttoned to the waist with a gathered underbust seam that tapers into a midi-length skirt. With slender arms and a V-neckline, this dress is both feminine and fun ready for wherever the day takes you.'' The combination of the tea-style and the midi length make this dress a classy addition to your wardrobe. The Polka dot design is a classic pattern that will remain on-trend for years to come. John Lewis shoppers are giving mostly five star reviews, with one happy shopper saying: ''This dress is very easy to wear, feels good quality. Can be dressed up for a wedding or worn with trainers for everyday.''  Another added: ''Fits well and looks lovely on. Very nice material and the fabric drapes well. Nice and light for summer to dress up or down.'' A third said: ''This has been one of my best buys this year. Admired and liked by everyone and extremely flattering. Bravo John Lewis.'' All of the reviews were positive about the quality and the value. While it works well for this season, the dress could also be worn in the autumn months, when layered with a jacket or jumper.
