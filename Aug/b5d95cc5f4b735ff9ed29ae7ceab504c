The fragile beauty of Earth's frozen frontiers is captured in breathtaking drama and detail in the BBC's autumn treat Frozen Planet II: Life on Thin Ice, narrated once more by Sir David Attenborough. He says: "Life finds a way not just to survive, but to thrive." Other scenes from the Arctic, Antarctic and the globe's boreal forests, tundra and mountains see wolves hunt bison across snowy plains, ice kingdoms and a lizard capturing its prey with a snap and curl of the tongue. A taster clip is accompanied by a track written and performed by Cuban singer Camila Cabello and Oscar-winning German composer Hans Zimmer. Called Take Me Back Home, it is the first time a song has been written for a BBC natural history programme. And it will be performed at tonight's Earth Prom at the Royal Albert Hall by a "special star guest".
