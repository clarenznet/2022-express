Professional dancer AJ Pritchard and actress Maisie Smith were given gruelling tasks in the Jordanian desert. AJ, 27, said: "It was enlightening. Everything about the show is so positive - a massive life goal ticked." And Maisie, 21, added: "I've always pushed myself but this was beyond limits I didn't know I had. It was the best experience of my life." Other contestants in the Channel 4 show, which starts on Sunday, include Olympic javelin thrower Fatima Whitbread, 61, and taekwondo golden girl Jade Jones, 29. Fatima, below, said: "As a young woman, I was adventurous. Living in a children's home, I had a survival instinct, so doing Celebrity SAS is a knock-on from those days." Celebrity SAS is available to watch on Channel 4, Sunday, 9pm.
