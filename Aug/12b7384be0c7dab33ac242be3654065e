This relates to advice from Glen Dimplex Home Appliances and the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) regarding an ongoing investigation into a death due to carbon monoxide poisoning where a gas range cooker was in the premises. A Stoves, Belling and New World spokesperson said: “Given the risk of carbon monoxide, we are contacting consumers to remind them that they must use the gas grill with the door open, as detailed in the instruction manual. Doing so poses no risk of carbon monoxide build up.” A number of Stoves, Belling and New World gas range cookers are impacted and customers are being urged to contact 0800 110 5729 or email consumersupport@glendimplex.com in order to confirm if their cooker is affected and to receive the latest advice. Consumers that no longer own the cooker are being urged to contact with forwarding details. The model number, starting with 4444, and the serial number will be needed when contacting the company. This can be found by opening the main oven door. It is located on a badge on the frame below the oven cavity. “We have stringent health and safety measures in place, and all our cookers are tested to industry standards and by the British Standards Institution (BSI) before they are made available to buy,” the spokesperson added. “We will continue to raise awareness of the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and to encourage the highest standards of testing industry-wide. “We are working closely with the OPSS to highlight the risks of carbon monoxide and we support their message of informing consumers to only use gas grills with the door open.” Consumers with one of these gas range cookers in their home can continue to use the product as per the instruction manual, but must ensure that the grill door is left open while the gas grill is in operation.
