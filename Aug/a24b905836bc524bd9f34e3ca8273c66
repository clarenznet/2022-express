Party officials have confirmed that 8,700 members have signed a petition demanding a veto on whether to accept the Prime Minister's resignation. It means they are just 1,300 short of the 10,000 threshold that could force the Tory party to change its constitution. Signatories of the petition, organised by donor Lord Cruddas, want the Conservatives to consider changing its constitution to allow a vote on whether the membership accepts Mr Johnson's decision to stand down.Lord Cruddas has urged the current leadership contest to be suspended to determine whether there was likely to be enough support for the rule change.He warned that continuing with the ballot between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss risked sparking a crisis within the party as a vote on Mr Johnson was unlikely to be able to be organised before a new leader was announced on September 5."CCHQ has confirmed this week that 8,700 Tory party members have signed a petition demanding a veto on whether to accept Boris Johnson's resignation,” he said."But what happens if a Boris ballot comes after the leadership campaign is completed and we have a new Prime Minister? "Once the threshold of 10,000 signatures is reached, then the ballot will still go ahead regardless of who is elected leader."We want a simple ballot on whether to accept Johnson’s resignation regardless. That is the member's constitutional right."I am aware of the chaos which might be triggered when the 10,000 threshold is cleared, and a confirmatory members ballot is held."This is why I am calling for the present leadership campaign to be suspended until we know the member's views.”Lord Cruddas first set up the petition last month after Mr Johnson announced he was quitting as the Tory party leader in the face of the mass resignation of his ministers.Last week's polling indicated Mr Johnson was still the preferred choice among the Conservative party membership to be Prime Minister.
