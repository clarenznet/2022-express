Gwyneth Paltrow, 49, appears to have moved away from her days as a Hollywood star. The businesswoman sported a pared-down look as she was pictured taking a day out in New York. The star was dressed in a silk short-sleeve white shirt buttoned to the top. She teamed the shirt with a pair of beige khaki three-quarter length shorts. To complete the stylishly preppy new look, Gwyneth accessorised with an orange handbag, gold bangles, and orange shades. She swept her hair up into a bun and finished off with a pair of white trainers.
