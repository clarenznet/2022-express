The Home Office says it removed 61 people on charter flights to Poland and Romania. The 23 returned to Poland included a criminal sentenced to 12 years in prison for rape and another given eight years for robbery.  Among the 38 being deported to Romania were two convicted sex attackers given eight and seven years respectively, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the criminals “have violated our laws and our values, leaving victims and their families to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives in the aftermath of their abhorrent crimes. “The British public should be in no doubt of my determination to remove them by all available means to make our streets safer.” In July alone 243 criminals were removed from the UK.
