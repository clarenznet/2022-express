A Place In The Sun presenter Laura Hamilton has sparked a frenzy on Instagram after sharing a jaw-dropping snap of herself soaking up the sun in a bikini. Sharing the sun-drenched picture in view of her 160,000 followers, the property expert, 40, lounged on the end of a boat as she reflected on her holiday in Greece on the final day. Laura wrote: "I've had the opportunity this week (whilst working) to see a lot of Zante and although I wasn't a big fan of the main strip in Laganas, there are some incredible coves and beaches only accessible by boat in other areas on the island. Today we rented a little boat and I got to explore a bit more with Rocco and Tahlia.." She went on to list places she'd enjoyed the most whilst on the island, however, it was her phenomenalÂ bikini shot which garnered the most attention.
