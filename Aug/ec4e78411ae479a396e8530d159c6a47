House of the Dragon is the highly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel, with the first episode of the big budget new HBO show airing in the UK tonight. House of the Dragon - which takes places hundreds of years before the events of Game of Thrones - will be airing on Sky Atlantic which can be accessed via the contract-free NOW service and through Sky TV services like Sky Q and Sky Glass. If you're watching House of the Dragon through NOW you'll be missing out on an exclusive Sky TV feature, with the GoT prequel airing in 4K HDR on Sky Glass and Sky Q. This was confirmed by Sky to Cordbusters, with the TV giant adding that NOW won't be getting House of the Dragon in 4K. However there are some caveats that Game of Thrones fans need to know. Firstly, House of the Dragon will be available to watch in 4K HDR as long as you have the right subscription on your Sky Q or Sky Glass set. Also, it appears that the live version of House of the Dragon will not air in 4K HDR - instead, the on-demand version which you need to connect to broadband to watch will be available in UHD. This will be available to watch sometime after the initial broadcast of House of the Dragon. Unfortunately for NOW viewers, House of the Dragon won't be available to watch in 4K as the Sky streaming service does not support this format. If you want to watch House of the Dragon in 4K then you'll need to have one of the Ultra HD add-ons that Sky offers for Sky Glass or Sky Q. With Sky Glass this will cost you an extra £5 a month while on Sky Q it's an extra £12 a month. This is on top of the existing price you're paying for your subscription, with Sky Q plans that include access to Sky Atlantic available from £26 a month while you can get Sky Glass right now with access to Netflix, Sky Atlantic from £39 a month. This deal also includes six months free broadband and a free £100 pre-paid Mastercard thrown in as well.
