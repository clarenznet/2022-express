  The two co-judges brought the glamour to the red carpet last night, as they posed beside one another in their eye-catching dresses. Heidi donned a Barbie-inspired one shoulder dress that showed off the beauty's long, tanned legs. Meanwhile, Sofia dazzled in a ruched hot pink wiggle dress which highlighted her incredible curves. The pair stood with their arms round one another as they prepared to watch the semi-finals, where they would also be joined by fellow judges Howie Mandel and Simon Cowell.
