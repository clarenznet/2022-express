And royal expert Daniela Elser labelled the images “cheeky and hilarious”.

Until the Duke and Duchess graduated, the pair were often out of the limelight, as Ms Elser notes “the press had agreed to leave William alone while he was studying, meaning that aside from only the very, very occasional blurry shot, they lived a pretty normal life”. Fans lapped up the resurfaced images, with one user writing: “They certainly enjoyed their university days.” Another added: “How is she so photogenic! These are the roughest pictures of her in existence and she still looks like a flipping goddess!”  DON'T MISS:Princess Anne 'always knew Meghan had short royal shelf-life' [COMMENT]Huge plume of smoke rises near shopping centre as blaze rages [PICTURES]Millions of households to be hit by second hosepipe ban [INSIGHT] A third said: “It’s nice to see them happy and relaxed.” While a fourth chimed in: “Couples that party together, stay together”. It is unclear when the images were taken, but the couple appear to be in their 20s. The 20-second video shows the pair “a galaxy away from the staid, sober marrieds they are today”. Kate and William moved in together as students, with her becoming his first “official” girlfriend.
