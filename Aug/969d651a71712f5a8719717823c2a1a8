The former Chancellor said he will cut waste from Whitehall budgets to provide emergency payments to households this winter. Mr Sunak's campaign said energy bills in January could be as much as £3,616, adding that leadership rival Liz Truss's plans to cut taxes "won't touch the sides" of dealing with mounting living costs. He also launched a fresh attack on Ms Truss's plan for tax cuts in an emergency budget, describing it as a "big bung" for large businesses and the better-off. Mr Sunak was on the campaign trail in Ribble Valley, Lancs, yesterday. The former Chancellor told a meeting: "This winter is going to be extremely tough for families up and down the country and there is no doubt in my mind that more support will be needed. "I'm very clear about what is required to help people and as soon as we know how much bills will go up by, I will act. And it's important for people to know how this extra support will be paid for." "In order to keep any one-off borrowing to an absolute minimum I will first seek efficiency savings across Whitehall to provide direct support for families to help with the unprecedented situation we face." "I have led people through difficult times before and I have the experience to do it again." "It takes leadership to recognise the challenges we as a country face and putting in place the right plan to get through them to a brighter future." "I did it before as Chancellor and will do it again as Prime Minister." Mr Sunak said he would use the same "framework" he used to announce a universal £400 discount through the Energy Bills Support Scheme, direct payments of £650 for households on means-tested benefits, £300 for pensioners and a £500million extension of the Household Support Fund by another six months.
