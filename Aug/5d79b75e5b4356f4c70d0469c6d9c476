Desperate British tourists could be seen running to get the best spot as soon as the hotel's swimming pool opened at 8am in a video shared on social media. Holidaymakers at four-star Spring Hotel Bitacora in Playa de las Américas, Tenerife, could be seen queueing next to the swimming pool gate at 6am to get the best sunbeds. It is believed some of the hotel guests waited for as long as 90 minutes. In the video, some can be seen running and then throwing their bags and towels to take their favourite spot by the pool. Tourist Chloe Turner, who captured the video, explained this was her "family favourite" resort.
