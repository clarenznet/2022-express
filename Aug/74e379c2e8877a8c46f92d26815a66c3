The Â£52million French defender, 28, denies eight rapes against five women, including one as young as 17. He also denies one charge of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. Cross-examining one accuser, who claims Mendy raped her in 2020, his barrister, Eleanor Laws QC, told Chester Crown Court the woman was in a WhatsApp group called "Sunday Shlagggs" with a second alleged victim, who was planning to sue Manchester City. She told the jury the two went on holiday together and had been out for dinner and drinks 25 times in one year. Ms Laws told the court the alleged victim was "trying to minimise" how well she knew the second woman, who had gone to the police two days after the pair had exchanged WhatsApp messages. The trial continues on Monday.
