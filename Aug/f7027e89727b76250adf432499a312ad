The US streaming giant's decision to axe Archewell Productions' first animated series, Pearl, as part of a wider cost-cutting move sent shockwaves through the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, it has been claimed. Meghan and Harry, according to a source described as an Archewell insider, called an "all-hands meeting" in the wake of the cancellation, which was announced in May. As reported by the entertainment newsletter The Ankler, the source said: "Harry and Meghan called an all-hands meeting. They were deeply concerned about the optics of this. Meghan wanted to talk to Ted [Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix]." Another source denied the meeting had a 911-emergency tone. Pearl was one of the two projects announced by Archewell Productions - Meghan and Harry's production powerhouse dedicated to creating content for Netflix - last year. Following the axing, which was announced following a dip in subscribers witnessed by the streaming giant, the Duke and Duchess' organisation is still working on a docu-series, called Heart of Invictus, focused on Invictus Games athletes preparing for the Games which took place in April as well as the ethos of the tournament launched by the Duke in 2014 and the power of sports and community. Meghan and Harry announced to have signed a deal with the streaming giant in early September 2020 and have yet to release a finished product.
