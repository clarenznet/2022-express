The Cambridges' children will enjoy a nurturing education at the wholesome, independent day and boarding school for three to 13-year-olds near Ascot. The Good Schools Guide describes the establishment as a "classic prep school" with a "heart of gold". It tells of how youngsters get to "run and run" in the vast grounds with "total freedom to explore, provided you have your wellies". The "superb facilities" include a 25-metre pool and a nine-hole golf course. Fees are £4,389 a term for Louis, £6,448 a term for Charlotte and £6,999 a term for George. That is £53,508 in 2021-2022, not factoring in any sibling discount, if this is available, or the cost of their uniform or trips.
