Three yellow thunderstorm warnings from the Met Office are in effect on Monday as an "Azores Highs" pressure system breaks after bringing a week of sweltering heat. Conditions are set to turn with temperatures dropping by up to 10C in some areas, while rainfall and thunderstorms are likely across the UK. Netweather.tv has issued a storm forecast, which holds that between Sunday morning to 6am on Monday the UK could see isolated large hail up to 2-3cm in diameter, flash-flooding, frequent cloud-to-ground lightning and strong wind gusts. They said: “Through the afternoon, surface heating of moist surface airmass, characterised by dew points of 15-17C across Ireland, N. Ireland, S and W Scotland this afternoon, combined with cooling aloft will yield up to 800-1200 j/kg CAPE this afternoon. Increasing ascent aloft from the west combined with surface breeze convergence or orographic lift will likely trigger some surface-based thunderstorms too. “Although vertical shear will be fairly week (0-6km shear 30 knts or below) – high CAPE may produce some isolated large hail (2-3cm) in stronger storms that develop, while PWAT values reaching 30mm may lead to high rainfall totals leading to flash-flooding. “Also frequent cloud-to-ground lightning and strong wind gusts will be additional hazards for outdoor activity. A severe storm risk area has been delineated across the island of Ireland, S and W Scotland.” Monday’s weather warnings cover Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales. England and Wales is in effect from 10am on Monday through to midnight, and holds: “Already some showers to start the day, but these likely to become more widespread and heavier through the late morning and afternoon, lasting into the evening in places. “Some counties are likely to miss the worst of these storms but where they do occur, slow-moving torrential downpours could produce 20-30 mm inside an hour, with 40-50 mm falling in around 2-3 hours in a few spots. Hail and frequent lightning could pose additional hazards for some. The Northern Ireland and Scotland warnings are in effect all of Monday, and said: “Whilst some places will avoid them, thunderstorms and areas of heavy rain are likely to continue to affect various areas of Northern Ireland and Scotland overnight and at times through Monday. “The thunderstorms may begin to ease across western and northern areas later. 20-30 mm of rain could fall within an hour in a few places, and up to around 50 mm in three to six hours. Hail and frequent lightning are also possible hazards.” READ MORE: Royal LIVE: Harry and Meghan fears as Sussexes ‘punished’ Tuesday sees another thunderstorm warning for England and Wales, in effect throughout the day. It says: “Whilst some places will miss them, thunderstorms and areas of heavy rain will develop quite widely on Tuesday across much of England and Wales. 20-30 mm of rain is possible within an hour, but where areas of thundery rain become slow-moving, some places could see 50 mm in less than three hours. “There is a low probability that higher totals could occur in a few spots over the course of the day, while hail and frequent lightning are likely additional hazards for some places. There is considerable uncertainty at this stage in regional and county level focus.” On Wednesday, a thunderstorm warning is in effect along the south of England from 9am to midnight. It says: “Whilst some places will miss them, thunderstorms and areas of heavy rain will develop quite widely on Wednesday across the southern England. 20-30 mm of rain is possible within an hour, but where areas of thundery rain become slow-moving, some places could see 60 mm in less than three hours. “A few spots could see more rainfall than this still, whilst hail and lightning may be additional hazards.” It adds: "There is a small chance of fast flowing or deep floodwater causing danger to life."

The rest of the UK however sees the end of heatwave conditions, with temperatures as high as 31C in the south of England. Overnight into Monday, Scotland’s rainfall pushes south and eases, and by 9am 1mm showers will feature in Wales and the south west. At 3pm, England sees the last of the heatwave, with high temperatures mitigated by cloud cover and some small showers, while Scotland is washed-out by a 3mm an hour ban of rainfall from Norway. Monday evening then sees temperatures drop with 20C in the south and a milder range between 10C and 15C along the west and north of Britain. Nick Finnis, Netwather.tv director, wrote for the agency’s website that across northern and western areas of Britain on Monday, “it will likely be less hot with more in the way of cloud and some heavy showers or thunderstorms breaking out through the day”. He said: “Slow-moving heavy showers or thunderstorms developing more widespread across England and Wales on Tuesday, with a risk of localised flooding. “Scotland and N. Ireland turning drier and cooler through the day, as northerly wind develops here. “Wednesday looks to see showers and thunderstorms become increasingly confined to southern areas through the day, drier and sunnier across the north, but turning cooler across all parts with a north or northeasterly breeze. “More of a westerly flow developing on Thursday and Friday, though some uncertainty for later in the week on rainfall. Thursday could be looking dry, though a few showers in the west. “Friday more likely to see some rain spreading east.”
