Our next Prime Minister should slash fuel duty by ­ at least 20p a litre to ­help tackle the problem, experts said. Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK campaign, said Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss must take action amid the cost-of-living crisis. He said: “Petrol and diesel are 25p a litre higher than necessary. We can’t wait until September for you to act.” Mr Cox and ­several MPs have called for the Government to now introduce PumpWatch, a proposed independent pump pricing monitoring body. He said: “The foul stench of profiteering gets even more overpowering.” Oil giants such as ­­ BP and Shell have reported a surge in profits because of ­ the rise in oil and gas prices amid the war in Ukraine. A Competition and Markets Authority review found March’s 5p fuel duty cut had been implemented. But it ­highlighted significant differences in diesel and petrol prices in rural and urban areas. Robert Halfon MP, vice chair of ­ the FairFuel parliamentary group, said: “This is ­literally highway robbery from the big oil companies."
