 Dame Diana Rigg, who died in September 2020, looks stunning in a daring white jumpsuit with a flowing cape at the back in photos from 1967. The actress was pictured in her role as Emma Peel in The Avengers, when she was aged around 29. She posed with a white horse at Camber Sands, soaking up the sun in the risque outfit. Dame Diana died from lung cancer aged 82, six months after being diagnosed, with her beloved daughter Rachel, also an actress, announcing the sad news. "My Beloved Ma died peacefully in her sleep early this morning, at home, surrounded by family,” she told The Mirror. "She died of cancer diagnosed in March, and spent her last months joyfully reflecting on her extraordinary life, full of love, laughter and a deep pride in her profession. "I will miss her beyond words.” Her agent earlier announced: "She died peacefully early this morning. "She was at home with her family who have asked for privacy at this difficult time." They went on to say: "Dame Diana was an icon of theatre, film, and television. "[She] was a much loved and admired member of her profession, a force of nature who loved her work and her fellow actors. She will be greatly missed." The late actress left £5,000 from her £3.3 million estate to the manager of her favoured salon, much to her surprise. The manager has however turned the cash down and has given it to Diana's grandson instead, insisting she cared for her client-turned-friend “out of love”.
