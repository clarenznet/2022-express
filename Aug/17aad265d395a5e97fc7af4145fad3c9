The funding is the latest pot that has been made available by the Royal Naval Benevolent Trust (RNBT) charity which celebrates its centenary this year. Help towards living expenses, house repairs, disability aids, job training and care home top-up fees can all be considered. However new research by the charity has revealed that while there are up to 500,000 people who could be eligible, over half, and especially 18 to 34-year-olds, are not familiar with what’s available or are not coming forward. In the past year the RNBT has pledged over £161,000 in grants to support both former and serving Naval personnel to pay essential household bills and rent, with a more recent surge in the wake of the cost-of-living crisis. Anyone who has served as a Rating in the Royal Navy or Royal Marines other ranks and their dependants can apply. Captain Nick Fletcher, chairman of trustees, explains: “The RNBT’s commitment to those who have served, or are currently serving, is more important than ever before, with the current inflation in prices and other external stresses. “Over the years I have witnessed the charity support those facing incredibly difficult times, and I’m proud of the impact we have been able to make on those who deserve it most and look forward to helping further in the future.” RNBT chief executive Rob Bosshardt urges “anyone from the naval family who needs help to get in touch with RNBT. The first call is always difficult, but you will be talking to someone who is keen to help.”
