Elizabeth Hurley, 57, has been pictured cuddling up with David Walliams, 51, as the pair holiday in the South of France at Elton John’s residence. Liz could be seen with her arm on Britain’s Got Talent star David’s chest as they smiled for a photo. They were visiting Elton’s home in Nice, France, and joined by his husband, David Furnish. Model Liz wore her brunette locks in loose waves, and a white strappy dress with purple flowers. David looked summery in a black floral shirt, his arms clutched around Liz. The author posted several of the photos on Instagram, in view of his 2million followers. “With the dreamy @elizabethhurley1,” he wrote. He also posed for photos with David and Elton as they boarded a boat together and soaked up the sun.
