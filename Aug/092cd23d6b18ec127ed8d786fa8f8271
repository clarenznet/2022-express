Trade association Solar Energy UK said just over 3,000 solar installations are being carried out every week - up from 1,000 a week in July 2020. Some providers have reported a tenfold surge in enquiries this month as experts warned bills could rocket to £6,000 next year. Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK, said: “More solar panels are being put on British roofs than ever before.” The amount of electricity solar panels generate depends on the type and size of the system and house but a typical home could cut electricity bills by more than £300 a year. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests a standard solar panel system costs between £9,000 to £11,700, while Solar Energy UK lists the cost of a "typical" 3.1kilowattpeak system for a three-bed house as £3,925. He said a typical solar panel system could generate £1,200 worth of electricity in a year at current prices. If energy bills rise by 80 per cent in October plus a further 50 per cent in January then the value of electricity generated by a typical system could climb to around £3,240. Mandip Bhamra, head of renewables at SaveMoneyCutCarbon, said: “Solar panels are perfect for residential properties with a south, east or west-facing roof, preferably without any shading. "Depending on how old your house is, you may want to check your roof is structurally sound before fitting the solar panels onto it.”
