Tennis fans won't see Nick Kyrgios suit up for Team World at this year's Laver Cup after he announced his decision to withdraw from the tournament. It was hoped the Australian would go up against a dream team comprising the likes of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray. Kyrgios consistently draws major crowds thanks in large part to his fiery personality but underlined his talent with a maiden major final in July. The Wimbledon runner-up will instead enjoy some deserved time with his family after a rigourous 2022 season thus far. "No Laver Cup for me this year," wrote Kyrgios via his Instagram story. "Just letting you all know. Gotta have that home time with my family and beautiful girlfriend." Despite excelling in London just last month, Kyrgios will forgo the opportunity for a swift return to England's capital. This will be the first time the Canberran has missed out on the tournament, having featured in all four editions to date following the inaugural contest in 2017.
