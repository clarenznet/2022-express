In a series of racy bedroom snaps, Ulrika declared herself a "feminist" who makes "good sourdough and good love". In a lengthy birthday message dedicated to herself, Ulrika penned: "HBD to me!!! "Newest member of Club 55. I’m smart. I’m funny - peculiar AND haha. I’m kind. I’m generous. I’m lively and opinionated. I’m stronger than you could ever imagine. "I’m also soft af [as f***]. I’m impatient. I’m filthy. I’m perceptive and know you better than you know yourself. I’m a lover not a fighter. But if you push me, I’ll fight like a lion. I’m a proud feminist." She went on: "I’m not the person I was in my 20s, 30s or even my 40s. I’m carving out a new life for myself now and I’m excited. I want to love and be loved. But rather be on my own than suffer fools. I make good sourdough and good love. And I still hate goat’s cheese." Ulrika added the hashtags: "#birthday #55." The TV presenter, who rose to fame in the 90s, was inundated with birthday messages from celebrity pals and fans alike.
