The new Premier League season begins tomorrow but clubs are still busy in the transfer market. The window does not close until September 1 and Manchester United and Chelsea want more signings before then, while many clubs are set to oversee further outgoings.  Brighton on Tuesday night denied claims they have agreed a deal to send Marc Cucurella to Chelsea for £52.5million. They said: "Contrary to inaccurate reports from numerous media outlets this evening, no agreement has been reached with any club to sell Marc Cucurella." The Blues could also recruit a striker with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang emerging as a shock new option. They have also held talks with Benjamin Sesko, the RB Leipzig attacker who is on the shortlist of Manchester United. The Red Devils' summer has been slow at times despite their three signings and they would dearly love to bring in Frenkie de Jong before the deadline. Elsewhere Tottenham may make a centre-back signing while Arsenal could still recruit further. And they are not the only clubs looking to make more signings. Express Sport keeps you up to date on all the latest transfer news coming out of the Premier League below...
