Days earlier, the 50-year-old had been having "a flutter" on the National Lottery's Mega Cash Showdown Instant Win game. It was 1.30am and she was keeping an eye on fiancé Wayne Tilbury, 57, who had a chest infection. Maxine "didn't quite get the game" and, even after receiving a message to say she had won, carried on playing. She later woke Wayne to tell him the news. Alive "I said 'Wayne, we've won £1million'," she said. "He literally stirred and went, 'Well, you can't do anything about it now so go back to sleep.' "So I had to wait all night until he woke up!" She went on: "Everything has just been surreal. "I feel really lucky. I'm here, I'm alive, and we've just had a bit of a cherry on the top of the cake really." The occupational therapist, from Kettering, Northants, decided to go public to encourage other women and men to check their bodies. Maxine said: "We didn't want to go public initially. But I'm passionate that if one woman, or man, goes and just checks their skin or their breast…if there's anything different, let the specialist tell you that."
