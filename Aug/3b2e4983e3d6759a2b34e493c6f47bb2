Ex-Coronation Street actress Brooke Vincent, 30, left the cobbles last year after playing Sophie Webster for 15 years. However her absence didn't deter her former workmates from offering admiring comments on Instagram as Brooke paraded her bikini body. The striped zebra print bralette showcased Brooke's voluptuous cleavage, while the matching bikini shorts were shaped with a curved hem to enhance her hip to waist ratio. "Turns out itâ€™s Zebra season," she teased in her caption in view of her 935,000 followers. Ellie Leach, who plays Faye Windass on the soap, commented: "Erm WOW" and added a fire emoji, while former on-screen sister Helen Flanagan, who played Rosie Webster, echoed her comment. Lucy Fallon, who previously played Sarah's daughter Bethany Platt, declared her look was "unreal", while others including former Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley (Eva Price) also shared their admiration.
