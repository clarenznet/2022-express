The US may bring in more troops from America to bolster the Baltic region against any possible threat from Russia, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said. Speaking at a press conference with Latvia's Defence Minister Artis Pabriks, he said the US would conduct more military exercises with Baltic nations such as Latvia, and look to provide increased training. In the first visit to Latvia by a US defence secretary in nearly three decades, he added plans to do continuous rotations of forces into the Baltics will likely use troops from US brigades in Romania and other parts of Europe, but "we can also bring in forces from the United States." The announcement comes as Putin reels from explosions at a Russian airbase in occupied Crimea. The explosions were reportedly caused by a Ukrainian Special Forces unit who have been making the Russians' lives hell in Crimea. The Russian Federation denies the explosions came as a result of Ukrainian attacks. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
