Last season Wrexham narrowly missed out on promotion to League Two are currently fifth in the National League, the game's fifth tier. But Deadpool and X-Men star Ryan says the sky's the limit. He said: "It really is about putting Wrexham on a world stage to build this team." "It's an underdog story and that's something I love. I'm certainly in if for as long as I can be meaningful and add to the club inexorably marching to one day being in the Championship or the Premier League." "People might roll their eyes at that notion, but why wouldn't we aim there? What a wonderful and incredible story that would be." The actor, 45, said he quickly fell in love with the town - population 65,000. He said: "I'm obsessed with Wrexham. I'll admit that at the beginning, I wasn't hooked that I was in a way I am now." "Part of me wishes I had never found football. I feel like it is legal poison. My joy lives and dies on those Saturdays when the club is playing." "I do feel like it chews my organs and spits them out each week, win or lose. It is a hell of a ride and there is really nothing like it." Rob, best known for comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, agrees. He added: "The town reminds me of Philadelphia. It's a working-class town. I feel I am one of those people." A Disney+ documentary series, Welcome To Wrexham, follows the actors' battle to attract a host of talent to their club. It will be shown from Thursday.
