Now back from her holiday, the age-defying beauty could not resist showing off her new look as she gave fans a glimpse of her freshly cut and coloured hair. The 61-year-old uploaded a series of photos as she sported a white shirt teamed with a pair of skintight leggings that accentuated her famous bottom. Taking to Twitter yesterday, the mum-of-two donned heavy eye-makeup while taking photos in her walk-in wardrobe. Carol captioned the post: "Chopped 2 inches off my hair this morning. Tried on some trousers and heels but ended up in trainers and Leggings AGAIN." The BBC Radio Wales host, who boasts 488,000 followers, was swiftly inundated with comments as her legion of fans gushed over her appearance. The snaps come days after she continued to show off her shrinking figure at the Â£1,475 per week Juicy Master Retreat. The television presenter exhibited her incredibly toned physique in a metallic silver bandeau and matching bottoms while posing in a pair of sunglasses.
