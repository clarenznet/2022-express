Carlos Sainz will line up on pole position for this year's Belgian Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen set to start from near the back of the grid despire setting the fastest lap at the end of Saturday's qualifying session. The Dutchman is one of six drivers to have been handed a grid drop penalty as a result of an engine change, while Valtteri Bottas will also be starting from down the order after swapping his gearbox. The large number of grid penalties will see Sainz, who was the second-quickest driver behind only Verstappen in Q3, take up pole position when the five red lights go out to begin Sunday's race. He will be closely followed off the line by Sergio Perez, while Fernando Alonso will head up the second row of the grid in front of Lewis Hamilton. George Russell will line up in fifth position in the other Mercedes car, with Alex Albon, Daniel Ricciardo and Pierre Gasly in sixth, seventh and eighth place respectively. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, is set to begin from all the way down in 15th ahead of Charles Leclerc, Esteban Ocon, Lando Norris, Zhou Guanyu and last-placed Mick Schumacher.
