Trevor Dann, former head of BBC Music Entertainment, said the station “risks the wrath” of faithful listeners by axing beloved broadcasters who have become like “family friends”. Steve Wright recently announced he was stepping down from his afternoon show after more than 20 years, while big names Graham Norton, Simon Mayo, Paul O’Grady and Vanessa Feltz have also left.  Mr Dann said: “If you’re seething about the high-handed way the bosses are treating you, don’t bother writing to complain, because they don’t care what you think.” He blamed the “obsession for change” and attempts to attract younger listeners for the exits. Mr Dann also warned Radio 2 “won’t be able to hang on to its remaining stars” in the face of competition from media rivals Global and Bauer. Writing in this week’s Radio Times, he said: “The modernisers at the Beeb think of Radio 2 as a comfy old high street boozer. “Out goes the cheery landlord with his tankards. In come the baristas, shot glasses and exposed air-conditioning pipes.  “In the world of audience research, listeners are nowhere near as important as potential listeners.” Over the weekend, veteran presenter Roger Bolton also took aim at BBC bosses as he hosted his final Feedback show for Radio 4 after being told he was no longer needed. He said: “The BBC belongs to all who pay for it, not those paid by it.” A BBC spokesman said: “While we always want new listeners to discover Radio 2, we are focused on providing the people who tune in each week with a brilliant range of programmes, hosted by some of the UK’s best-loved presenters.”
