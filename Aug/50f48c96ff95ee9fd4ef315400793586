Rishi Sunak defended his stance on taxes to BBC host Nick Robinson despite backlash from Tory Party members who have claimed he has made the decision in order to succeed in the election. The Tory leadership candidate claimed his decision on taxes was entirely consistent with what he had previously stated. Mr Sunak discussed his decision to previously cut income taxes in Britain when he was Chancellor. Mr Sunak then went on to discuss why the UK was the only country to raise taxes during an economic crisis due to how the NHS is funded. Mr Robinson said: "Last time you were talking to Justin over two weeks ago, you said I don't cut taxes to win elections, I win elections to cut taxes. "Now the reaction to your proposal has been... Look he thinks he's going to lose to he's brought up a big tax cut to try and rescue his position." Mr Sunak told Radio 4s Today programme: "No! No, defiantly not, this is entirely consistent with what I've been saying for a long time. "And that's why as Chancellor I set out a plan to cut income tax in Parliament already, the first penny off the basic rate in almost 15 years was something I announced as Chancellor. "And what I'm talking about today is my desire to go further than that over time, and people should know that's where I want to take the economy. "I think hard work is really important to value, important to Conservative voters and members, I want to make sure that hard work is rewarded and the best way to do that is to keep cutting income tax over time, and that is what I set out a plan to do."

Can you name another country that has raised taxes at a time of a record cost of living squeeze and faltering growth?" Mr Sunak said: "Well we're also a country that is tackling the NHS backlog because we fund our NHS in a different way to all other countries. "So we have to recognise that..." Mr Robinson said: "What's the answer to the question?" Mr Sunak added: "Well name another country that has a publically funded healthcare system, that is funded through tax revenues entirely?" Mr Robinson said: "So there is no other country that has raised taxes at a time of this crisis?"   READ MORE:'Great loss!'

"Other countries are doing different ways to do this, right so, my point is I don't think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on a rise would be wise. "I think everyone gets that is a point of differentiation between us, but we need to also look beyond that, and that's why I want to give people a sense of where I want to take the economy once we grip inflation, and that's an economy where we actually reform business taxation."
