British families have been isolating at the Maritimo Beach Hotel in Sissi, Crete, with vomiting and diarrhoea. They claim travel firms have continued to send holidaymakers to the 130-bed four-star hotel.  NHS nurse and mum-of-two Wendy Hampton, 44, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, said: "We arrived on Sunday and ate dinner in the restaurant. By Monday we were all vomiting." EasyJet said it was investigating the reports, while Jet2 said it was supporting its customers. The hotel declined to comment.
