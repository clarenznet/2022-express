Hugh Jackman and his wife of 26 years, Deborra-Lee Furness, could not stop smiling as they took their seats in the New York stadium to watch Serena Williams beat Danka Kovinic in the US Open Women’s Singles First Round match.Hugh, 53, looked very smart in a dark blue suit over a white shirt and paired with some dark trainers. Deborra, 66, also looked lovely in a long, white, shirt dress over some linen trousers and beige platform sneakers.Before they headed to the game, Hugh took to Instagram to wish Serena the best of luck.He wrote: “Off to the @usopen to watch the one and only @serenawilliams. Serena - Deb and I are so excited to watch you play and bear witness to your evolution for many years to come. "You are an icon and a true inspiration to boys and girls around the world #GOAT.” (sic)
