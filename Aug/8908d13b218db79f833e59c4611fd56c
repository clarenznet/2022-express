Since Brexit, British tourists are seen as non-EU nationals in the bloc. From next year, Britons will be charged a seven euro (£5.90) fee to travel to the EU. The European Travel and Information Scheme (ETIAS) was initially set to be introduced in September 2023. The EU has now announced that the introduction of the new scheme has been pushed back until November 2023. Every British traveller will have to apply for an ETIAS on an official website or app and pay the fee to enjoy a holiday in the EU. The scheme is an additional security and border measure which will be introduced due to security concerns.

However, in some more complicated cases it could take as long as 30 days for an ETIAS to be granted. The ETIAS visa will be valid for three years or until the tourist’s passport expires at which point they will need to apply and pay again. ETIAS was designed by the EU to strengthen border control and improve security in the Schengen area. Some travel experts have expressed fears that the scheme could lead to longer queues at UK borders. The Port of Dover has warned that the scheme could lead to lengthy delays at the border. Eurostar told Express.co.uk: “We are working closely with UK and EU member states authorities, as well as with our station owners, to prepare for the implementation of both EES and ETIAS.” It added that it had shared concerns about the scheme’s impact on queuing and is actively working with Governments to try to find solutions.
