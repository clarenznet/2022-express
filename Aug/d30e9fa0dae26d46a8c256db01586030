One of the reasons the Duchess of Cambridge's story is such a fairytale is because she came from humble beginnings. Carole Goldsmith was born in 1955 to builder Ronald Goldsmith and shop assistant Dorothy Goldsmith. The family lived in Hartington Road, Southall, a tiny pebble-dashed terraced house. In the early 1960s, it was a staunchly working-class area with many residents working in nearby factories.

The three-bedroom home was bought for £4,950 in 1966 - the equivalent of £135,000 today. Whilst working for British Airways, she met Michael Middleton, an air steward who was later promoted to a flight dispatcher. The couple moved into an unassuming leasehold flat at 33 Arborfield Close, Slough, Berkshire SL1 2JP.  In those days, Slough was an industrial suburb populated with factories for businesses such as Mars, Citroen and Dulux paint.  Located opposite the village green, the Victorian house boasted a large garden and was eventually converted into two semi-detached homes. It's been described as “a late-Victorian period house of immense charm".  In 1987, after her children were born, she established Party Pieces, a company that began by making party bags and now sells party supplies and decorations by mail order. Success enabled the family to move again, buying Oak Acre, a Tudor-style manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire in 1995.  It is a quintessential English village, plus home to John Madejski, the multi-millionaire owner of Reading Football Club, DJ Chris Tarrant, singer Kate Bush and TV personality Melinda Messenger.
