When a couple live together both incomes have to be assessed before deciding how much benefit is due. But hundreds keep their partner secret and claim to be living alone. Investigators now search Facebook, TikTok and Twitter for evidence of people living together.  Latest figures from the Depart-ment for Work and Pensions estimate the total overpaid to “single swindlers” is £879million a year, although the real total could be almost £1.1billion. Two years ago the figure was £215million. Much of the new fraud is believed to have been committed by people making illegitimate applications for Universal Credit. It can cost hundreds of pounds in benefits every month when a partner moves in. Georgia Piggott, 23, was given a suspended jail sentence after posing as a single mum to claim £13,600 in benefits. She pocketed the extra cash over two years before officials discovered she had set up home near Salford with Jordan Edge, 23, the father of her two eldest children.  Claire Bostock, 32, swindled nearly £50,000 by lying to DWP staff that she was a single mum for six years. But she was caught out living with the father of her three children when officials saw pictures of the pair at a Christmas party. Bostock, of Bolton, claimed extra housing benefit and income support while her partner worked for a flooring company. She was ordered to repay the cash in instalments and given a suspended sentence. Recent estimates suggest £6.5billion in benefits was fraudulently claimed in the last year – almost £18million a day. John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Taxpayers are sick of feckless fraudsters. Ministers must get a grip on false claims and come down hard on criminal claimants.” A DWP spokesperson said: “Fraud remains low, with 95 per cent of benefits paid correctly. “However, we take any abuse of taxpayers’ money very seriously. “Our new fraud plan announced this year commits £600million to driving fraud and error down.”
