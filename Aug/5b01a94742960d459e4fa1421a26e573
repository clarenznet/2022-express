Omar Badran's "foolish generosity" backfired in December last year when he let the man he didn't know use his driveway in the Stoke area of Plymouth. The black car had remained there in the eight months since and Omar was unable to reach the owner.  But now the Mercedes has finally been removed from the driveway and sent to a scrapyard. Speaking to Plymouth Live, Omar said: "The car was removed by the scrap guy who took it away. It didn’t cost me anything else other than the legal fees for the legal advice. I just want to move on with my life now. "This entire thing has made me really miserable and so many people have told me I’m stupid for having allowed him to park on my driveway but I was just trying to do a nice thing." Omar agreed to the stranger's request on the condition that when he wanted to use the driveaway again, I would be able to do so. But he claims the owner was unreachable in the months since. Omar explored many legal avenues but removing property which doesn't belong to the proprietor is considered legally a "grey area". Omar continued: "I was shocked by my initial search, it’s legally a grey area and you might not be able to get the council, police or the DVLA to do anything about it, even though the vehicle is uninsured, isn’t taxed and has no MOT. “I phoned up all these places and they said they couldn’t do anything." He eventually discovered a solution in the form of the Torts Act adding: "I found that under the Torts Act there is a way to deal with it. It took me several weeks and a lot of stress, I thought I was going to be stuck with a really bad situation that would involve thousands of pounds spent in a civil court." Omar added a sign, which has been placed against the windscreen of the car on his driveway last month which read: "Under the Torts Act, this vehicle will be disposed of in one week from 27/06/22 if the owner does not collect it."
