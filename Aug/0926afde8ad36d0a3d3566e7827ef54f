Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta could be without four first-team players for the first game of the new Premier League season. Emile Smith Rowe has reportedly been ruled out of the opener against Crystal Palace on Friday. The Gunners have had a busy summer transfer window and there is a sense of optimism at the club. The arrival of Gabriel Jesus in particular is seen as a missing piece to Arteta's jigsaw. But it appears there are already several fitness concerns ahead of the new campaign.

He is due back in first-team training next week but hasn't featured much in pre-season.
