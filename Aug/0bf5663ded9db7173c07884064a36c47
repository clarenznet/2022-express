Demi Rose Mawby, 27, looked quite a spectacle as she showed off her futuristic look at the idyllic party hotspot of Santorini. The Pretty Little Thing model is continuing her extended Greek Islands break after a summer packed full of travelling - and she has wasted no time in sharing her latest snaps with almost 20 million avid followers. The colour of the deep blue sea reflected off Demi's boots as a bright orange sunset burned above her. Her outfits - from nothing but leopard print ski suits to crystallised costumes - have always been eye-catching, but enjoying the sizzling sunset in thigh high metallic boots is a brand new addition to her repertoire. Meanwhile, another recent photo portrayed her nearly nude except for a pair of angel wings and panties, quickly receiving more than 300,000 likes.
