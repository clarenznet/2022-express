The UK’s chief medical officers and the national medical director of the NHS in England recommend that the Covid alert level moves from three to two. A level two alert means that “Covid-19 is in general circulation but direct Covid-19 healthcare pressures and transmission are declining or stable”.  They said the Covid-19 wave of the Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 is “subsiding”. Covid rates in the community have fallen as have cases needing hospital care, they said. However, they added that further Covid surges are “likely” as they urged people to take up the offer of vaccination.  The autumn booster campaign is due to start within days. Professor Christina Pagel, of Independent Sage, tweeted: “Quick Covid update for England – hospital admissions still falling and we are now back where we were in May 2022 between the two recent Omicron waves. “In May we could already see BA.5 growing, but there’s nothing like that in England right now [as far as I can tell-good news!]”
