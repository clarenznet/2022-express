 Mr Dugin is reportedly in hospital after the attack, which Russia has now blamed Ukraine for. Kremlin analyst Olga Lautman reported that Dugin had suffered a heart attack, quoting his close ally Sergei Markov. Mr Markov posted on his Telegram channel: "Poor Alexander Dugin. He is in the hospital now. Our huge condolences." Several reports have also suggested Putin carried out the plot. Russian expert Anders Aslund tweeted: "It appears most likely that Putin killed Darya Dugina. He has that habit. "The videos at her house were out. Alexander Dugin was supposed to be in the car. Why would Ukraine waste resources on such a target?" "Given Putin's fondness of false flag operations, it is most likely that he ordered Dugin to be blown up, making it look as done by the Ukrainians, while Dugin's daughter was blown up instead. More such murders are likely."  FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
