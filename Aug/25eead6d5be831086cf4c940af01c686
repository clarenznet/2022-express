It comes as a little boy was found wandering the streets in his pyjamas in June. Officers and a large number of volunteers spent the night searching for the boy.   So many people turned out to help with the search that police eventually asked members of the public to "please return home" at around 2am. Officers were concerned the numbers involved might scare the child into not returning home.  The youngster was found by around 10am the next morning - nearly 12 hours after going missing. Police and firefighters had initially knocked on doors and searched a river without success.
