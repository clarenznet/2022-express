It was expelled permanently in 1975 but, after a change of government, competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics as Zimbabwe. 83 years ago (1939) Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty dividing Poland between them. Known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it outlined a guarantee of peace and commitment that neither nation would ally itself to the enemies of the other. The pact ended with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. 37 years ago (1985) West Germany's head of counter-intelligence was uncovered as an East German spy after defecting to the country. At least six others were suspected of involvement in Hans-Joachim Tiedge's spy ring, including a secretary who was working in West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office.
