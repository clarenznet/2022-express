The glamourous actress, who was in her early 20s at the time, shared a rare glimpse of her preparation before coming face-to-face with royalty. A photographer captured images of the beauty ahead of their meeting as she could be seen getting ready in an old Elizabethan house at a country club in Elstree. One photo showed Sophia sitting in front of a mirror placing a diamond necklace around her neck, while another photo showed the smiling actress being assisted with her gown. Sophia met the Queen at a London premiere and wore a lace jacket with white fur trimmed sleeves over her strapless gown for the event.
