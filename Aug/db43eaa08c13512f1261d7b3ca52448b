Earlier this week, the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, Countess of Wessex were reunited at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. As two working members of the Royal Family, Sophie and Kate are known to be very close and the pair gravitate towards each other at royal engagements. According to body language expert Judi James, Sophie showed her "open-armed affection" for the Cambridges at the sporting event this week. "After Diana’s death and Fergie’s banishment from the Firm, Sophie is left as the only royal wife of that generation and her body language here provides some clues that she and Edward might go out of their way to try to breach that emotional gap in the family when it comes to support and open-armed affection for William and Kate and their children," she told the Mirror. "Her greeting here seems to define her as the best auntie, going out of her way to hug and welcome her nephew and his wife as they take their seats to watch the sport. "As Kate leans in Sophie throws both arms around her torso, clutching Kate’s right arm in her left hand to ensure the hug lasts and patting Kate's back in an add-on ritual or extra bonding and reassurance as the two women cheek-kiss."
