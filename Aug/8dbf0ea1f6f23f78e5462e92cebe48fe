Remainers have already pointed the finger at Brexit, claiming that leaving the EU is the cause of the UK’s financial crisis. In June, the Resolution Foundation think tank said that “Brexit appears to already be weighing on both UK openness and competitiveness” in international trading.

Inflation has been rising for months and is now set to reach more than 13 percent, making it difficult for many to afford basic goods and services.
