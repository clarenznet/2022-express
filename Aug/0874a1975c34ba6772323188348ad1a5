Deividas Skebas was arrested on Saturday after a CCTV appeal over the death of Lilia Valutyte in Boston, Lincolnshire. The 22-year-old Lithuanian was remanded into custody at Lincoln Crown Court after not being required to enter a plea to the charge. Wearing a prison-issued grey ­tracksuit and sporting heavy stubble, he spoke only to confirm his name and was told a provisional trial date would be set at the next court hearing. Lilia died from what is understood to be a single stab wound at 6.20pm on Thursday as she played with her younger sister outside her mother’s work. The girls had been using a hula-hoop, while a toy pram was left at the scene. Lina Savicke, 35, the girl’s mother, and her stepfather, Aurelijus Savickas, 32, both originally from Lithuania, are being cared for by relatives and ­specially trained police officers. Lilia’s father, who lives abroad, is understood to have arrived in Boston on Sunday afternoon. Skebas was detained by armed ­officers after CCTV images were released of a man who detectives wanted to trace. The CCTV showed a man in Boston around five minutes before Lilia was found dead. Police also said two ­people who were arrested earlier this week have now been released, with no further action being taken. Remanding Skebas into ­custody, Judge Simon Hirst told him: “You will be next before the court on September 19. I hope on that day I can give you a trial date.” Earlier yesterday, Skebas appeared before Lincoln magistrates where he spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. Lilia was a talented dancer who attended classes with other Lithuanian children in Boston. She also took part in national street dance competitions. Dozens of flowers and other tributes were left in her memory near the scene. A service of reflection and prayer was held at a local church.
