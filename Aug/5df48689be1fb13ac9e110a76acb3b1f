Alec Baldwin's daughter Ireland, 26, was showing off her ample cleavage in a bikini decorated with symbols of France and Italy. The model's bikini top featured Amalfi Coast-style illustrations of lemons, and French croissants and baguettes, while her arms were filled with eye-catching tattoos. Meanwhile the plump-lipped star was also promoting a peptide treatment she'd been taking. In other recent snaps, she seemed keen to show off the results of a mini facelift she'd had together with her cousin Alaia. She posted images of the pair recuperating with their faces tightly bandaged. The procedure is billed as "permanently destroying fat cells and simultaneously tightening the skin of the lower face and neck".
