Walkers at Penrose and Loe Bar beach in Cornwall say there has been an increase in the number of tents on the National Trust site, despite signs clearly stating that it is illegal to camp there.Â Campers are then leaving their waste and rubbish behind, including the remains of fires, which is a potential health hazard, especially to young children who play on the beach. One person told Cornwall Live: "Every time we go down there, especially at the weekend, there are people camping, especially at Loe Bar beach. "A lot of the wild campers are hiking on the coastal trail and staying there overnight. "There are loads of signs around saying 'no camping'. "We've found defecation in the hedges, tissue paper in the bushes and a chap there on the weekend had a fire on the grassland. "It's been going on for weeks now, since the start of the summer, and last year. Word seems to be getting out that it's a free-for-all." On Monday, August 1, there were several tents on the site as well as burnt wood and an abundance of litter. The campers are believed to have spent the weekend on the beach. A National Trust sign at the site south of Porthleven reads: "No fishing, swimming, kayaking, SUPs or any water sports permitted at Loe Pool. "No vehicular access to Loe Bar. No camping or overnight stays. Thank you for your support." Express Online has contacted the National Trust for a comment.
