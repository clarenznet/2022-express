The former Brexit Party leader stressed that Brexit Britain would "never get a grip on this situation unless we disentangle our nation from the ECHR". Writing in the Telegraph about successive plans put forward by outgoing Prime Minister Mr Johnson, he said: "His pledges excited much media interest and growing optimism that a solution to this crisis had been found. I, for one, never believed a word of it." He listed a number of instances which suggested the plans had been poorly thought through, such as using the Royal Navy to stop boats, which would not have been possible because the gunnels of the vessels are too high to safely lift any person from an inflatable dinghy. Mr Farage added that the Tory leadership hopefully, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, were currently underperforming in their solutions for this growing problem. Any leader who took this issue seriously would pledge untethering Britain from the ECHR, he stressed. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
