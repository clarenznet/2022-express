Finley Downer was on holiday with his family in the Bahamas when the horrific event occurred. He was attacked by at least three nurse sharks in an assault that left his family fearing for his life. Chunks of flesh were hanging off the young bog after both his legs were bitten. Dad Michael, 44, said: “My son could have been killed. It was like a scene out of Jaws.” Sales director Michael had taken his three children - Finley, Lily, nine, and Emily, 12 - on their dream summer holiday last week. Their five-island excursion included guided swimming with iguanas, pigs and nurse sharks at Compass Cay. But on a neighbouring island later in the tour, they spotted some sharks swimming with a group of people in a lagoon. The children decided to join them - but their decision would prove nearly fatal. They were not aware that the sharks were feeding on scraps being thrown to them. Michael said: “Suddenly, I heard a terrified scream and saw dozens circling Finley. There was so much blood. “Bits of his leg were hanging off. He kept saying, ‘Dad I don’t want to die. Dad I don’t want to go to heaven’.” Finley was dragged out of the ocean by his sister Lilly, who had lifted him out of the water by his arms.

Michael then paid for a £2,000 flight to take him to Nassau so he could have a three-hour operation on his wounds. The family is now back home in Kettering, Northants, but Finley is still using a wheelchair and will be left scarred. Michael is reportedly angry the tour guides said the sharks were safe. However, the tour guides’ operator Exuma Escapes said the family had gone without a guide into a lagoon not used on the tour. It added nurse sharks were docile bottom-feeders unless handled incorrectly.
