Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel had to be held back by their respective coaching staff after the Tottenham and Chelsea managers got into a bust-up following Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's equaliser for the visitors. Tensions had already been on edge between the pair heading into the London derby with the pair exchanging barbs in their press conferences.  And tensions boiled over on the touchline in Sunday's clash after Hojbjerg levelled up the game midway through the second half. The Denmark international picked up the ball on the edge of the box and let fly with an accurate effort into the bottom corner. Cameras quickly panned to the dugouts where Conte had ran out of his technical area to celebrate in the face of Tuchel. The Chelsea boss was furious as the pair were quickly separated by the fourth official. Conte appeared to remove himself from the situation before it escalated further while Tuchel and his Chelsea staff were incensed. The situation soon de-escalated as both managers returned to their respective dugouts.  But referee Anthony Taylor brandished a yellow card to both managers for their behaviour. The game had been relatively well-tempered before that exchange, but it appeared to bring the match to life. Chelsea had taken the lead in the first half when Kalidou Koulibaly volleyed home from a Marc Cucurella corner. Tottenham were struggling to find a way to break down Chelsea's rigid defensive unit throughout the match.  But Conte changed things up in the second half with Ryan Sessegnon going off for Richarlison. Tottenham shifted to a back four with Richarlison playing alongside Harry Kane up top. And the momentum immediately shifted for the visitors as they began breaking in behind Chelsea's defence. Kane should have equalised for Tottenham when he found himself in space in the box, but dragged his shot wide. But Hojbjerg soon made amends for Kane's miss with his arrowing shot from the edge of the box.
