With the Premier League season now officially underway, many top-flight clubs will know if they need to do more business before the window shuts. It is very much scramble time now and transfers are expected to come thick and fast as deadline day approaches.  Manchester United will be one of the most desperate teams in the Premier League to add reinforcements after a disastrous opening-day defeat against Brighton. Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot are both heavily linked, prompting mixed reviews from fans. Meanwhile, Chelsea are keen to bolster their squad and are in the hunt for United target Frenkie de Jong. Wesley Fofana is also on their hit list, although the Leicester man's Â£85million price tag could scupper his move to Stamford Bridge. Tottenham are still pursuing Nicolo Zaniolo with Antonio Conte viewing the Italian as his 'dream' signing. However, little progress has been made over the past few weeks and Roma are understood to be keen on retaining his services. Other big clubs such as Arsenal and Liverpool could yet do more business - especially with Thiago facing six weeks on the sidelines following his injury in the 2-2 draw at Fulham. The likes of Newcastle and West Ham are also expected to be busy in the next few weeks. FOLLOW EXPRESS SPORT'S LIVE TRANSFER UPDATES BELOW...
