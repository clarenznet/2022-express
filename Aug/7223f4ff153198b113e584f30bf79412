The last decade has proven disastrous for GP surgeries, with at least 474 forced to shut their doors. Researchers have found that, while pandemic-era struggles have left NHS services in dire straits, these closures have ramped up since 2013. Figures obtained via analysis by GP trade publication Pulse have discovered that many of these surgeries share key qualities. As part of their Lost Practices investigation, Pulse staffers found that GP closures started with a trickle in 2013. Roughly eight closed that year, and the total quadrupled in 2014 when 32 surgeries shut down. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, 46, 64, and 56 more followed, adding 166 during David Cameron's first three years in office. Closures peaked in 2018 when 98 closed for good, and hundreds more have since followed.

Another 44 closures identified by Pulse in 2021 brings the pandemic total to 100. Altogether, up to 1.5 million people have had to search for a new GP surgery away from home since 2013. Researchers identified a series of factors that have left them chronically struggling for years. Data from the investigation has revealed that closures are split unevenly across the UK's home nations. Most of those shutting are in England, followed by Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The total closures are concentrated as follows: While the pandemic piled pressure on the NHS, data shows the issues have persisted long before. Pulse researchers identified "triggers" for 162 surgery closures in their dataset. Of those, more than 40 percent had recruitment issues that served as a "final straw for the practice". Each surgery also had "markedly smaller list sizes" than the average, especially in England, where closing GPs had 2,738 registered patients. Most of these surgeries were also located in more deprived areas than others, possessing a deprivation score - a poverty measure based on income, employment, education, health, crime, living environment and barriers to services - of 3.81. Poverty in the UK is rated on a scale of one to 10, with the lowest noting higher deprivation and a national average of 4.41 per GP practice. Ultimately, many of the surgeries closing - 69 percent in total - received lower funding per patient than others in good financial health.
