In one impressive shot, Australian actress Nicole Kidman, 55, modelled flame red hair, which flowed down to her hips, with chunky layers to frame her face, and dazzled in a slogan top and micro mini skirt, both by Diesel. Nicole showed off her taut and toned thighs, the result of an incredible workout regime, and extremely muscular arms, which she stretched out dramatically. In her second cover, the Big Little Lies star sported patent PVC thigh high boots, together with an all-black outfit with just a section of loose-flowing fabric covering her incredible physique. Interviewer Jason Campbell probed Nicole for the magazine, and discovered that she "clicks with photographers", as she loves to "play" with fashion imagery. "I’m not here to stamp myself on you, but rather you stamp yourself on me and for us to grow together," the Moulin Rouge actress declared. Photography was by Zhong Lin (@zhonglin) while styling was provided by Robbie Spencer (@robbiespencer). The full Nicole Kidman shoot and interview features in Perfect Issue Three ‘Perfect Awards’ Autumn/Winter 2022, which goes on newsstands 1 September, theperfectmagazine.com
