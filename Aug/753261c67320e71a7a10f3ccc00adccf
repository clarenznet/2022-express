Benjamin Mendy has pleaded not guilty to another charge of rape after appearing in court on Wednesday. The French footballer entered the plea in a hearing at Chester Crown Court as preparations get under way for a trial. The 28-year-old has now denied eight counts of rape, one of sexual assault and another of attempted rape, the hearing was told. Aside from the latest charge, which was put to him earlier, Mendy pleaded not guilty to all the remaining charges against him back in May. The trial is now expected to begin on Monday and could last longer than three months, with jury selection due to start on Wednesday. The offences against the women are alleged to have taken place at Mendy's home between October 2018 and August 2021. Mendy, of Prestbury, Chesire, is due to stand trial alongside co-defendant Louis Saha Matturie, 40. Matturie, of Eccles, Salford, has also denied eight counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault relating to eight young women. His alleged offences span from July 2012 to August last year. Both men, who are on bail, were present for the proceedings. A French interpreter was also in the dock with the defendants for the hearing. There were 20 members of the media present in court to report on the hearing, with others watching via videolink. Due to legal constraints, none of the women involved can be identified and reporting restrictions will apply ahead of the trial. Mendy signed for Manchester City in a £50million transfer from AS Monaco in 2017 and made 75 appearances for the club, scoring two goals. He has appeared as a senior international for France with 10 caps, making his debut in 2017. He has won the Premier League on three occasions since his move from Ligue 1, but has not played for the club since the opening day defeat against Tottenham last season.
