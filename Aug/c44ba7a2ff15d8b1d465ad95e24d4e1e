  A selfie showed Vernon looking like he’d come straight out of the sea next to a glam-looking Tess, who wore large pink-rimmed sunglasses and hoop earrings. “Superb few days in Ibiza!” he captioned the snap. “A beautiful place with awesome people and great vibes.” In another post from the weekend, a clip saw the pair joyfully singing along to Rihanna’s We Found Love in a huge crowd. “@calvinharris ThankYou! @ushuaiaibiza Nothing but [heart emojis],” Vernon wrote. “What a Friday night in Ibiza!! We Found Love… (My vocals are insanely good).”
