The huge 400 metre long cargo ship is positioned off the Lowestoft coast in Suffolk. The HMM Stockholm is one of the biggest container ships ever made. According to vesselfinder.com, the ship arrived at its current position on Saturday (August 27) after leaving Belgium's Port of Antwerp. The Panama-registered vessel is due to dock at the Port of Hamburg in Germany on September 16, reports Suffolk Live. Earlier this month another giant ship - the Eleonora Maersk - was also anchored off Lowestoft. It is believed that the ship was at anchor because of delays at the Port of Hamburg and it is likely the that the same applies to the HMM Stockholm. It comes as a Royal Navy patrol vessel shadowed a huge Russian ship as it passed close to the UK's south coast last week. HMS Mersey followed the Russian Navy tanker Akademik Pashin through the English Channel, off the south coast of Devon. It is the latest Russian Navy vessel to pass close to our shores under the watchful eye of the UK’s Armed Forces.   Following HMS Portland’s recent tracking of two Russian submarines in the UK’s area of interest, Portsmouth-based patrol ship HMS Mersey was called upon to monitor the movements of the Pashin from the North Sea, through the Dover Strait and down the Channel towards the open waters of the North Atlantic. The oiler is the first tanker built for the Russian Navy since the end of the Cold War, supplying the ships of the Northern Fleet with the fuel they need to sustain operations. Able Seaman Jordan Mavin was the first sailor to sight the Pashin. He said: "We were aware of her movements for some time and everything came together to allow us to shadow her. "Operating so close to our own coastline I was proud to be part of the team who monitored her movements."
