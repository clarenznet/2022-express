With the Premier League season now officially underway, many top-flight clubs will know if they need to do more business before the window shuts. It is very much scramble time now and transfers are expected to come thick and fast as deadline day approaches. Manchester United, more than most, need signings through the door after their humiliating 2-1 home defeat against Brighton on the opening day of the season. Adrien Rabiot and Cody Gakpo are currently their No 1 targets with deals for both stars under way in some capacity. Chelsea, meanwhile, want to another defender and have made Wesley Fofana their priority, though Leicester's £85million demands is currently holding the deal up. Newcastle are also tipped to splash the cash in the next few weeks with a striker high on their agenda. They have a number of targets in their sights and will reportedly make a bid for a £25m-rated Goncalo Ramos, who is also being tracked by PSG. The likes of Arsenal and Liverpool could also yet bring in at least one more fresh face, with a busy few weeks expected as we approach the end of the window.
