 Max Verstappen has been handed two extra points in the world championship after Charles Leclerc was handed a post-race penalty. The Ferrari star pitted for soft tyres late on in a bid to get the extra point for fastest lap.  However, the FIA said Leclerc had driven too fast down the pitlane which saw him awarded a five-second penalty. The FIA report explained Leclerc had travelled one km/h too quickly during his stop in a  massive blow. The penalty drops him from fifth to sixth meaning he will only score eight points instead of 10. Leclerc also failed in his bid to secure the fastest lap after he came out behind Fernando Alonso and had to re-pass the Spaniard on the final lap.  Speaking after the race, Leclerc took responsibility for his speeding infringement. He said: “Well I mean the pitlane is not bad luck, it’s just my fault. It's a mistake and that’s it.  “On the other hand We were just not quick enough this weekend and this is the big problem more than anything.” When asked whether he was still in the championship fight with Verstappen, Leclerc added: “It starts to look very difficult. “Especially with the pace they have shown this weekend it’s going to be very difficult. But I will keep my head down and try to focus race by race and do my best.”  Alonso laughed after the race when he was asked whether he was shocked at Leclerc's late pit stop. He told Sky Sports F1: “I was surprised but Ferrari does some strange strategies.”
