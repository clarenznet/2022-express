Millions of Britons will have welcomed today's weather, having gone several months without rain, but the intense showers come with several inherent risks. Experts have warned that baked earth is not prepared to absorb the excess water, which may pool on the surface in several hard-hit areas. The Met Office has warned that flooding today could cause a "danger to life", and the Environment Agency has placed 16 alerts. Met Office forecasters have placed the entirety of England and Wales under a single alert today as thunderstorms could cause a "danger to life" via flooding. The agency has predicted 20mm to 30mm (0.7 to 1.18 inches) of rain per hour across both home nations until 11.59pm today, August 16. Floods caused by intense rainfall could cause "fast flowing or deep floodwater" and a "danger to life".
