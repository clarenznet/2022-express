Nick Wisniewski, 66, lives amid 128 empty flats after the last of around 200 residents moved out last December. The council wants to flatten the estate and redevelop the area, but Nick is refusing to budge.  He bought his flat in 2017 under the Right to Buy scheme. He said: "The council offered me £35,000 for my flat and two years' rent free somewhere else. "But I am not prepared to start paying rent again and £35,000 is not enough to buy somewhere new. You're talking £80,000 to £100,000. "I'm worried. I really don't know where I am going to end up living." Nick said Stanhope Place, in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire - made up of eight blocks - used to be buzzing with 200 people.  But it now lies abandoned and overgrown with empty properties boarded up. He said: "It's like a ghost town now. It's so quiet and strange being the only person living here. "I'm used to it now, but it can get lonely, there is nobody around to speak to "I didn't work all my life to have my home taken from me when I am too old to get a mortgage on something else." North Lanarkshire Council said: "We fully understand this is a sensitive issue and are working closely with the resident."
