Davina McCall, 54, hasn't been slacking on her fitness regime as even a Turkish holiday provided an opportunity to show off her moves. The exercise fanatic praised her personal trainer, Harriet, who skipped around with her beside the pool. Both were determined to exercise in style, and Davina paired a candy pink sports bra with a pair of leopard print briefs by luxury swimwear designer Melissa Odabash. Though she was meant to be taking a break, Davina works out six days per week regardless of where in the world she finds herself. Meanwhile she revealed via her Instagram account that the video footage of the workout was courtesy of her fitness app project, Own Your Goals.
