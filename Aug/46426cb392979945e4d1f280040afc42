The "devoted mum" was found unresponsive and could not be resuscitated after dying in her sleep a few hours into the flight. Her traumatised husband and children spent the remaining eight hours of the journey on Friday sitting next to her - in a "breathless sleep" - until landing in Frankfurt. A friend has claimed the "devastated" family found a measure of solace in this as they had the opportunity to say their last goodbyes while beside her. Her body had to remain in Germany while her husband and children then continued on to the UK. Jayne Jeje, who has set up a fundraiser, said: "Helen and her family wrapped up a life in Hong Kong to embark on a new chapter back home in the UK. "She was excited and nervous about the move but looked forward to seeing family as she had not seen some of them or her ageing parents since before the pandemic." The pal added: "Helen was one of a kind, a gem. She was always willing to lend a helping hand or advice. Helen loved to talk and made friends easily." While living in Hong Kong's Tung Chung area, she is said to have become the "pulse of her community" and was an invaluable member of a motherhood group in the district. Jayne added: "This fundraiser is to honour this lovely woman who was loved by so many, a dear friend. "This loss is so painful and surreal. The grief that we feel is paralysing. Yet we feel lucky to have known her." The GOFUNDME page, to help the family with expenses, has raised £12,200 of a £20,000 target.
