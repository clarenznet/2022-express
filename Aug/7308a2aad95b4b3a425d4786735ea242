Julianne Moore, 61, looked ageless as she attended the prestigious meal in Venice, Italy, ahead of the 79th Venice International Film Festival. The Hollywood actress slipped into a plunging black and yellow dress, featuring a daring conical top and a billowing maxi skirt. Julianne, who is the president of this year's jury, stunned in the low-cut black dress, with the black and yellow polka dot skirt. She accessorised with gold bangles, gold hoop earrings and strappy black stiletto heels. Julianne wore her signature red hair in a straight style, finishing off her look with a simple yet elegant makeup palette, making sure not to take attention away from the dress.
