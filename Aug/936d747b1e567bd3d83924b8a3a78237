Anal cancer is a “rare” cancer that can start in any part of the anus - the opening at the end of the bowel. Around 1,500 people are diagnosed with it in the UK each year, equivalent to four a day. However, according to Cancer Research UK it has become “more common” over the last 20 years. The charity says: “There is a larger increase for women than men.” As would be expected the symptoms affect that area of the body. And five of these will become noticeable when you go to the toilet. Cancer Research UK explains: “The most common symptom of anal cancer is bleeding from the back passage (rectal bleeding). You might notice this as blood in your poo.
