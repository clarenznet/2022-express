Davina McCall, 54, regularly keeps her fans updated with her gruelling workout routines, and she showed off the results at the ITV Autumn Entertainment launch on Tuesday. The TV presenter looked incredible in the figure hugging black dress, which boasted long sleeves and a cut-out neckline. She elevated her gym-honed figure with a pair of stiletto heels as she posed up a storm. Davina posed alongside fellow The Masked Dancer judges Peter Crouch and Oti Mabuse. The hit dancing series which is hosted by Joel Dommett will return to screens this weekend for an eight-part second series.
