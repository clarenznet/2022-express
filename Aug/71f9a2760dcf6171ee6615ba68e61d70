Halle Berry, 55, has the same striking good looks today as back when she scored her breakthrough role in the 1992 film Boomerang. The seductive star made waves when she starred with Eddie Murphy, and has had a string of hit movies since. Halle, who is perhaps best known for the 2004 classic Catwoman, was widely photographed in the early 90s, in these unearthed and scarcely seen throwback photos. Take a trip down memory lane with Halle in this photo set, which sees her model every type of outfit from a daring pair of cut out jeans to a figure-hugging and curve-enhancing lacy gown. Prior to her glittering movie career, the sizzling star competed in beauty pageants, once claiming the runner-up title in Miss USA.
