The 11 documents written to a friend include invitation notes, giving insights into the author's reading habits and writing projects as well as details about a trip to Switzerland. Dickens in one letter, dated February 10, 1866, complains about the loss of a Sunday postal service and threatens to move from his home at Higham in Kent, saying: "I most decidedly and strongly object to the inconvenience." The letters are among 300 items bought for Â£1.8million in 2020 from a collector by the Charles Dickens Museum in London, which will show them there and online. Curator Emily Dunbar, said: "The letter complaining about the postal delivery is a great example of Dickens showing self-importance, his awareness of his great fame, and his position within society."
