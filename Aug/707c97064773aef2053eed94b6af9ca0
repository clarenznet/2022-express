Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, British citizens in Portugal were guaranteed their social and employment rights would be protected and had to exchange EU residence documents for a biometric residence permit. More than 34,500 Britons live permanently in Portugal and have been left detained at airports, paying to have broken bones treated or facing the risk of losing their jobs due to the delays in getting a biometric card. Instead, a temporary document and QR code was issued, which Britons say is not recognised locally or at international borders. Tig James, who runs the British in Portugal campaign group, said an estimated 41,000 British nationals were affected and she has spent the past three years “screaming from the rooftops” about the problem. She blamed the Portuguese immigration and borders service, SEF, and added: “SEF is wilfully, deliberately and systemically not adhering to the withdrawal agreement, resulting in the physical, emotional and financial suffering of thousands of UK nationals living in Portugal.” SEF said in a statement: “The current residence documents of British nationals living in Portugal continue to be accepted, even after the end of the transition period, and until the new residence card is issued.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES
