Golf icon and PGA Tour stalwart Rory McIlroy launched a stinging attack on the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series after winning £15.4million and the FedEx Cup. The 33-year-old four-time major winner put in a stunning performance at Atlanta coming from six shots down on the final day to beat world number one Scottie Scheffler. The battle between two of the sport’s stars resulted in McIlroy hitting a final round of 66 to come storming back to win the PGA Tour Championship with a score of –21, one shot clear of Scheffler and Korea's Sungjae Im. Afterwards McIlroy who has been firmly behind the PGA Tour in their battle against the rival LIV Golf hit out at the opposing series.
