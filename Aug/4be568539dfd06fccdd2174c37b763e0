Actress Lindsay Lohan, 36, pouted for the camera after a hair and makeup session, revealing her plump lips and sparkling eyes. Gone were her trademark freckles, replaced by flawlessly smooth skin, and the star looked years younger. The Parent Trap actress has also posted snaps of herself and new husband Bader Shammas, whom she recently married in a secret ceremony. The Mean Girls star, who stunned with her signature flame red hair, admitted that she felt like "the luckiest woman in the world" now that she has found her match. "Every woman should feel like this everyday!" she added in her emotional Instagram caption.
