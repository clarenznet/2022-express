The on-screen star, 53, took to Instagram on Monday and shared photos from her latest beach getaway with her pals, including Horrible Bosses co-star Jason Bateman and his wife Amanda Anka. The actress who swears by daily workouts and meditations, soaked up the sunshine as she flashed the flesh and put her toned legs on full display. One photo showed Jennifer laid out on her stomach in a beach selfie with her tresses soaked after taking a dip in the sea. Another snap saw the actress unveil her toned body while dressed in her mismatched black and red bikini and with a wide-brimmed hat over her face. Jennifer captioned the post: "Take us back," in view of her 40 million followers, who could not help but gush over her appearance. Maria Fernando commented: "No words for you, omg I'm freaking out about these pics. THANK YOU FOR THAT JENNIFER ANISTON!!" Giu wrote: "You are soooooo gorgeous!!!" while Ben remarked: "Breathtaking." Carol: "Jesus, you are perfect!"
