With galloping inflation, the cost-of-living crisis and the energy price cap set to rocket in October - with more woe due in January - it is time to cut Britons some fiscal slack, and Ms Truss aims to do just that. It's a story that should stir us all. Anne, a 51-year-old disabled woman says she cannot afford to eat three meals a day, weighs six stone as a result and is too scared to take a shower due to the cost. Enough. Society should be judged on how it treats the disabled and this needs urgent attention from the Government. Shaming research by charity Scope shows 14 million disabled people face extra costs of £583 a month, partly due to the need to maintain equipment. Anne relies on five devices that must be constantly charged. Moreover, the Leonard Cheshire charity says more than half a million disabled people live off just £10 a week after bills - despite Government support packages. The Daily Express End the Disability Bills Crisis crusade, calls on the Government to bring in a discounted tariff for disabled people with the highest energy usage. It's imperative we bring such measures to help people like Anne. It would be good if leadership candidates heeded the call. After Sunday's glorious game, several ideas have been advanced to celebrate the Lionesses' win, including a new bank holiday. That's not going to happen, but something should, and Boris Johnson's spokesman says the PM favours giving the victorious footballers gongs. We agree.The Lionesses have energised the nation - including those who normally ignore the beautiful game. It's only right they should receive honours from the Government and the Queen.
