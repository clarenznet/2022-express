Michael's daughter exuded confidence as she posed for pictures in a sleeveless party dress that revealed her arm tattoos as she exuded her usual boho chic style. Paris sported her blonde tresses in loose waves as she accentuated her features with a burgundy lip, dark eyeshadow and a hint of bronze to her cheekbones. She slipped into a pair of mahogany leather boots and accessorised her look with a matching handbag. Prince, who like Paris is the son of Michael's second wife Debbie Rowe, beamed as he held hands with his sister at the event. He looked equally dapper in a black suit which he teamed with a purple tie. The brother and sister attended the charity fundraiser held on August 19, with other famous faces including actor, Jamie Foxx, singer Eric Benet and performer Bobby Brown.
