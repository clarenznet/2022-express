If Conservative members vote to send Ms Truss to Downing St they will hand her a national rescue mission that would daunt her predecessors and will define her life. Thankfully, her powerful record of achievement gives us confidence she will not only lead the UK through the battles ahead but ensure the next generation inherits a richer, stronger and healthier nation. Ms Truss’s searing personal ambition is only matched by her passion for Britain.She yearns to do more than fix the immediate problems confronting our communities; she wants to transform our standing in the world so not a single one of the abundant opportunities unlocked by Brexit is squandered.That hunger for change is shared by millions of citizens who for years have watched men in suits trundle in and out of Whitehall without ever delivering the true rejuvenation of our former industrial heartlands.People who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 – because they long for prosperity to spread far beyond London and the southeast – can be assured that Ms Truss burns with that same desire.Right now, she is in the final stages of an audition for one of the toughest jobs in the world. If she wins, she will arrive at No 10 just as the cost-of-living crisis threatens to push working families into ruin, with the Bank of England briefing that the country is about to slump into a long recession.Runaway inflation, soaring energy costs, potential blackouts, strikes by militant trade unions, and dangerous delays for NHS treatments are just some of the items in an in-tray that would terrify most politicians. There is also the urgent task of defending Britain and our democratic allies from powerful foes, and Ms Truss will not want to go down in history as the PM who could not persuade the people of Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom. Few people would apply for a job that comes with such extreme pressure, responsibility and scrutiny, but we are glad that Ms Truss has entered this contest and believe she deserves to win.Having served as Environment Secretary, Lord Chancellor, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, International Trade Secretary and now Foreign Secretary, the 47-year-old mother-of-two has one of the most impressive CVs in modern politics.Ms Truss has served under three prime ministers and will be able to harness the full power of Government to address her most urgent priorities.One of the biggest challenges for any leader intent on change is overcoming bureaucratic inertia.But Ms Truss will not be outfoxed by Whitehall figures who would rather manage decline than lead reform.Just as important, she has the right values. When confronting emergencies she has the gut instincts and depth of knowledge to defend our national interests.Her commitment to low taxes and individual freedom is indisputable, and her policy agenda is a sorely needed dose of common sense Conservatism.People far beyond the Tory tribe will welcome the reversal of the hike in National Insurance payments. And scrapping planned rises in corporation tax will give businesses confidence to invest in big projects that deliver the well-paid jobs struggling communities need.The suspension of the green levies on punishing energy bills is a welcome first step towards stopping a social disaster, and the need for major investment in defence has been proven beyond doubt by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s efforts to dominate its neighbours.In this short leadership campaign, she has already set out a more inspiring programme for Britain than Sir Keir Starmer has achieved in his years leading Labour. It will be good news for the world if Ms Truss takes her seat among the G7 leaders.She has stiffened the backbone of western democracies in their opposition to Vladimir Putin’s aggression.In April, as the civilised world reeled at Moscow’s torching of international rules, Ms Truss declared there must be “no talk of removing sanctions” while the Kremlin has troops in Ukraine and the “threat of Russian aggression looms over Europe”.This sent a bold message both to Russia and to her more timid EU counterparts that there is no synthetic element to Britain’s outrage at the invasion. On Ms Truss’s watch, Putin’s gangster tactics will be neither normalised nor rewarded.Cynics snipe that the UK suffers from delusions of grandeur and has yet to wake up to post-imperial realities, but Ms Truss understands inaction would be catastrophic. She knows it is vital that the homeland of Churchill and Thatcher displays moral leadership and strengthens its military when tyrants, fanatics and autocrats want to reshape the world around their murderous ambitions. Equally, she appreciates that future prosperity depends on Britain securing game-changing trade deals and moving fast to win a competitive advantage that would have been impossible within the EU.At the heart of Trussism is a belief that if we grasp opportunities we can shape our future. As someone whose family lived in Paisley and who attended a comprehensive school in Leeds, she knows that Britain beyond the M25 is rich in talent but blighted by “geographic inequality” – and its people need new chances to shine.A Truss premiership would take the best of Boris Johnson’s aspirations for levelling up and pursue these goals with her unique energy, competence and determination.This former Remainer is now in no doubt that the people made the right choice when they voted to take back sovereignty from Brussels.If she takes control of Downing St her brand of modern patriotism can unite the party, renew the Government and reinvigorate the country.Conservative members who vote for Ms Truss are doing much more than choosing a Prime Minister. They are igniting a new era of change in Britain.
