The Duke of Sussex is preparing to publish his book by Penguin Random House by Christmas, and tell the first “accurate and wholly truthful” account of his own life, according to the publisher. But another book centred around the Firm, written by royal reporter Valentine Low, is set to be published right before the Duke’s and could therefore steal his thunder. Around the same period, in November this year, royal biographer Angela Levin is also due to publish her biography of Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall and future Queen Consort. Finally, royal reporter Omid Scobie is also preparing to publish his second biography, although this one reportedly will not be out until 2023. Tom Bower’s book ‘Revenge, Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors’ which has been on the shelves for a few weeks now, sheds light on the disputes between the Sussexes and the Royal Family. The book caused a stir as it revealed details about Prince Harry’s relationship with his father, Prince Charles and his brother, Prince William, and his relationship with Meghan Markle.
