Well, they are at the moment. And undertaking huge refurbishment projects is what this new makeover show is all about. Yes, all right, so most makeover shows are about that. Fair point. Well spotted. But this one, hosted by brotherand-sister property developers Stuart and Scarlette Douglas, highlights how pleasingly profitable such projects can be if you follow one crucial piece of advice. "Always buy the worst house on the best street," explains Scarlette, as she welcomes us to episode one of, funnily enough, Worst House On The Street (8pm). "It's an adage known to savvy buyers everywhere," Stuart insists. Clearly I'm about as savvy as a saveloy because it's certainly not known to me. But yes, I can see it makes sense, at least to the sort of buyers happy to put in hours of back-breaking physical graft - which, trust me, does not include any TV critic you'll ever meet. If Stuart and Scarlette look familiar to you, by the way, that's because they recently appeared as advisers on George Clarke's makeover contest Flipping Fast. If they don't look familiar to you, that doesn't mean they didn't, it just means you didn't watch it.
