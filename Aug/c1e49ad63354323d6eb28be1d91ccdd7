America’s Got Talent star Sofia Vergara has been enjoying herself in Miami, and posting sizzling snaps for her Instagram followers. The Modern Family actress showcased her curves in a series of eye-catching outfits. One was a bright orange co-ord with a very low cut crop top and long floaty maxi skirt, with a matching bag. “Miami nights,” she captioned the snap. In more photos uploaded to her 26.4million fans on the app, Sofia donned another low cut number - this time a strapless white corset dress. She has been spending quality time with her mother, Margarita Vergara, as well as Sofia’s son Manolo, 30, and niece Claudia.
