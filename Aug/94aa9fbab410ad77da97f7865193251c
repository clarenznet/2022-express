The city of Nikopol, which lies on the Dnipro river close to the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has been hit with 25 artillery shells, according to regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko. The blasts have caused an industrial fire and cut off power to 3,000 residents in the city. This comes as Ukrainian military intelligence reports that Russia has prolonged an order for the power plant’s workers to stay away, provoking fears that the Kremlin intends to decouple the plant’s electricity from Ukraine’s power grid and connect it to Russia’s - a highly complex process that experts warn may cause a nuclear meltdown. If electricity is cut off from the plant as a result of shelling or failing the decoupling process, radioactive substances could be released into the environment, with UN Secretary General António Guterres warning: “Any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide”.
