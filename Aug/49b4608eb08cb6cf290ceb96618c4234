  “Stewart Clan comes together,” Penny told her 158,000 Instagram followers, while tagging the many children present. Sir Rod looked dapper in a brown and cream checked shirt and a pair of pale blue silk trousers. Penny looked equally stunning in a long white linen dress, which she paired with sandals. To the left of the married pair was Penny’s son Alastair, 16, as well as Rod’s other children: Sean, 41, and Kimberly, 42. To their right was Penny’s younger son Aiden, 11, and Rod’s remaining children: Ruby, 35, Renee, 30, and Liam, 27. Rod’s eldest daughter Sarah Streeter, 58, was not present. As Rod and his girlfriend at the time, Susannah Boffey, were both teenagers when Sarah was born, they gave her up for adoption.
