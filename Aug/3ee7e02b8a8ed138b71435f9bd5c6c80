Mercury is set to soar yet again as the UK faces yet another heatwave next week. According to WXCHARTS, maximum temperatures on Thursday could reach 30C in parts of England and Wales. Residents in the south west might even experience 33C conditions, compared to highs of 32C in the south east. Scotland and Northern Ireland are not forecast to see temperatures reach such highs. However, it is still expected to be warm, with WXCHARTS putting the peak temperature at around 27C and 25C respectively. Brits can also expect to see conditions heat up in southern England on Tuesday and Wednesday. JUST IN: The week is also expected to be dry, with almost all corners of the UK set to miss wet weather yet again. Only the most northerly tip of Scotland looks likely to witness rainfall, according to WXCHARTS. The lack of rainfall comes as Hampshire and the Isle of Wight face hosepipe bans. Sussex and Kent will face similar measures from August 12. READ MORE: Residents in Pembrokeshire are also set for a hosepipe ban on August 19. Brits who breach the hosepipe ban could face a fine of up to £1,000. A spokesperson from Southern Water said: "If you see anyone breaching the restrictions, please let us know via our customer service team. "A fine of up to £1,000 can be imposed for any breaches. We would like to thank all our customers for supporting these restrictions and for doing your bit to protect your local rivers." DON'T MISS: However, any fine imposed would be handed down by the courts. The Met Office's midweek forecast said: "Staying dry with extensive sunshine, except for far north/northwest Scotland where cloudier with spells of rain or drizzle. "Temperatures increasing, becoming widely very warm or hot away from the northwest." Looking ahead to mid-August, the UK's national weather service added: "Temperatures will likely range from warm to very warm for much of England and Wales, especially across the southern parts."
