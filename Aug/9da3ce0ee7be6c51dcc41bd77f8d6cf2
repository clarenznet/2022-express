Xur is returning to Destiny 2 today with the vendor heading to a new location to set up shop. Last time around Xur was found at the EDZ on the Winding Cove, and was there until the most recent Destiny 2 weekly reset. Xur will be dropping into Destiny 2 at 6pm UK time today with a range of new rare Exotics to buy. Express.co.uk will update this article once the new Xur Destiny 2 location for today is discovered. If you're wondering what Xur could have in stock, here's what was available to buy last time around... - Tractor Cannon - Lucky Pants (Hunter) - Peacekeepers (Titan) - Aeon Soul (Warlock) The latest arrival of Xur comes as Destiny 2 season 17 draws to a close when the season 18 release date around the corner. As it stands, Destiny 2 Season of the Haunted is set to end on August 23. And the end of the current Destiny 2 season isn't the only reason for fans of the hit Bungie game to put that date in their diaries. That's because on August 23 Bungie will be hosting a Destiny 2 Showcase event. Details on the Destiny 2 Showcase are thin on the ground, with so far Bungie just revealing a teaser trailer for it. Alongside it the Destiny Twitter posted: "Witness what's next. "August 23, 2022". This event comes a year after the Destiny 2 makers held a similar event with the 2021 stream announcing The Witch Queen expansion. It's likely the upcoming Destiny 2 Showcase will reveal more on the next expansion - which is dubbed Lightfall. After this there will be one more Destiny 2 expansion which will complete the first saga of Destiny.
