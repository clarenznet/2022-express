Because the candidates refused to go head-to-head, it was a strangely flat occasion, lacking the fireworks of previous encounters. Ms Truss, perhaps burdened by her position out in front, certainly did not come across as a commanding figure.  Her answers to audience questions about the public finances and the housing market were weak, even trite - just as her claim that she wants to put more money into social care was undermined by her pledge to reverse the proposed hike in national insurance. Even worse was how she stumbled badly when asked about her glaring U-turn on introducing regional differences on public sector pay. Mr Sunak put up a good fight but did not do enough to alter the course of the battle. For the first time in this final round, though, he perhaps outshone his rival. He was as forceful and fluent as ever, displaying his usual command of the detail of economic policy.  He even got a cheer from the audience - the first of the night - when he said he would not drop out of the contest despite Ms Truss's large poll lead. Yet his position as the stern advocate of sound money is contradicted by his unconvincing promise of distant tax reductions and his pledge of an immediate cut in VAT on energy bills. Ms Truss did not emerge unscathed from the Sky studio. Even so, it remains her contest to lose.
