But those who start the day eating elsewhere risk low selfesteem and anxiety, researchers have found. Study lead Dr José Francisco López-Gil, of Castilla-la Mancha University in Spain, said: "Our findings reinforce the need to promote not only breakfast as part of a healthy lifestyle, but also that it should be eaten at home. "Skipping breakfast or eating breakfast away from home is associated with increased likelihood of psychosocial behavioural problems in children and adolescents." His team suggested family support at meal times may play a role, while food eaten away from home tended to be less nutritious. They quizzed more than 3,700 Spanish children aged four to 14. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.
