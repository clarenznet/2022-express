Helen Skelton took to Instagram to share a phenomenal swimsuit snap with her 323,000 followers. The Countryfile presenter, 39, posted a picture of herself in a swimsuit from behind, while she affectionately watched over her two sons, Louis and Ernie, as they enjoyed a day on the water in the Lake District. Helen captioned the snap: "Just like that the eldest two are old enough to pinch my boardâ€¦. Life jackets and eyes on at all times." Helen donned a black swimsuit with a large cut-out area which revealed a small tattoo on her lower back. She wore her blonde tresses in a high ponytail and accessorised with a pair of gold hoop earrings.
