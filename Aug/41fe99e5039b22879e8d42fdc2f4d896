Oti Mabuse, 32, has taken to Instagram to show off some skin as she stunned fans in a bright pink swimsuit while on holiday. The Strictly star shared the snap with her 643,000 followers, while embarking on her first summer of relaxation away from the BBC show, after quitting earlier this year.  The professional dancer was wearing a skimpy pink swimsuit as she lay on a towel in the heat.  The star’s face was covered by a unique red sun hat as she shaded her face from the sun's rays.  She wrote in the caption to the post: “Caught that sun I was wishing for.  “POV of friends: gosh this is fit @the_tls @rebecca_banks.  “Reality: forgot my hat in the room so I used a fan for shade. Woke up 3 minutes after this and hid in the shade.  “Ps: they hate my captions as well  #sobasic #summerholidays #relaxing”
