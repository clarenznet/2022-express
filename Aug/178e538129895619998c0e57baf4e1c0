Piers Morgan's blushes certainly weren't spared by Lord Alan Sugar, 75, after he very publicly mocked one of the 57-year-old's latest photos. The multimillionaire Apprentice star turned his attention to one of broadcaster Piers' legs sticking out of his shorts and seeming thinner than the other one as he posed in front of a sign advertising vegan shakes, organic lemonade and fairtrade coffee and tea. "I've gone full LA," Piers had told his 7.9 million followers in a nod to the ethical and health-conscious vibe. However he may not have been prepared for Alan's cutting response - "Optical illusion but your right leg looks like a toothpick." The banter marks a return to the historic feud the pair have displayed on Twitter over the years. Tweeters joined in with the joke, while one caustic viewer, @shave_stuart, declared: "His right leg is the least of his worries. Being a b*** e** should be the biggest concern." However @BalchinSarah defended the imbalance between each of his legs in the photo, retorting: "Could possibly be due to the fact that he injured a tendon in his leg a few years ago."
