The season 20 launch show will be pre-recorded on September 7 and fans can put in a bid for tickets to be part of the studio audience. And the date means fans are likely to know which celebrities are paired with which pro dancers around the weekend of Saturday September 10. A BBC online post said: “The stunning 20th series returns…and we’re extremely excited to be able to welcome an audience back to the studio. “Registration is now open to be part of the exciting Launch Show, which is recording in advance of the live shows on Wednesday 7 September.” A separate post explaining how to enter a draw to win tickets to the pro dancers’ party on August 24, reads: “The professional dancers will be throwing a party like only they know how, with a group number full of sparkle and glamour. There may well be a surprise or two as well, with special guests and fun tributes to some of your favourite BBC shows.” Strictly will again be hosted by Tess Daly, 53, and Claudia Winkleman, 50, live from Elstree Film and Television Studios in Hertfordshire. Craig Revel Horwood, 57, Motsi Mabuse, 41, and head judge Shirley Ballas, 61, will all return to the Strictly judging panel alongside Anton Du Beke, 56. Last month, the BBC confirmed Strictly will feature a record 20 pro dancers to mark the 20th series.
