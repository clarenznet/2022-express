These are the very companies whose prices have risen so high that the most vulnerable people in our society have had to make impossible choices between paying their bills and putting food on the table. At Gingerbread we support single parent families and I regularly hear heart-breaking stories of families who already can’t afford basic essentials and who are being forced into poverty and persistent debt because their outgoings far outstrip their income and yet still prices keep rising. Of course, we live in a capitalist society and companies need to make money but it feels entirely immoral that this is happening at the expense of people who are struggling to feed their families. Single parents are amazing – we’re excellent problem solvers and even when we feel like hiding under the covers, we can’t, so we carry on. We juggle parenting, working and everything else with very little support. The single parents I’ve met through Gingerbread are incredibly resilient but there’s a breaking point and when every single so called non-essential has been stripped from household budgets, what can you do? Single parents are being forced to make incredibly distressing choices – they really are cutting back to the bone – one mum said she’s turned off her fridge as she can’t afford the electricity to run it, another said she doesn’t eat when her children are at their dad’s house. There’s something gravely wrong. But this is now, and things will get much worse when temperatures drop and energy prices rise yet again in the autumn. Even more single parent families will be pushed into poverty and more children will go without food. These families simply cannot weather the storm of more price hikes. The solution is simple - this government needs to put more money into the pockets of vulnerable people and if that’s at the expense of energy company profits then that’s the price that must be paid.
