Members of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) at nine train operating companies, including Network Rail, will walk out from midday on Monday, September 26. The union remains in talks with Network Rail about the possibility of a settlement but is urging Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to intervene in a bid to break the deadlock. The strike action will coincide with the Labour Party conference in Liverpool.  The TSSA, a Labour-affiliated union, will be looking for support from delegates and MPs to join them on picket lines. Manuel Cortes, TSSA union leader, said: “The dead hand of Grant Shapps is sadly stopping train operating companies from making a revised, meaningful offer. “Frankly, he either sits across the negotiating table with our union or gets out of the way to allow railway bosses to freely negotiate with us, as they have done in the past. “The reason for the current impasse lies squarely at Shapps’ door and passengers are paying a high price for his incompetence and intransigence. “I welcome the fact that negotiations are ongoing with Network Rail and the gap towards a resolution is narrowing. Time will tell whether a deal can be done to avert our next strike.”  The Department for Transport said: “For the eighth time this summer, union leaders are choosing self-defeating strike action over constructive talks, not only disrupting the lives of millions who rely on these services but jeopardising the future of the railways and their own members’ livelihoods. “These reforms deliver the modernisations our rail network urgently needs, are essential to the future of rail, and will happen. Strikes will not change this.”
