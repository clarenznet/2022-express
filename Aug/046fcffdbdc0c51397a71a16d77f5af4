And the defiant vow is music to the ears of hospitality and tourism sectors still reeling from successive lockdowns. One father of two spoke for millions when he told the Daily Express last night: "If Covid has taught us anything, it's life is too short. It's been a miserable time for so many people.This year hasn't been a walk in the park either.  "But I have two daughters and, thankfully, they are immune to all the bleakness. "So, like millions of families, we're determined to put a smile on their faces and make this a summer to remember. We'll enjoy a staycation, days out and a few trips to restaurants." Some 70 percent said they would holiday at home this year, according to the latest analysis.  Oliver Barker, who runs Catgill Farm in the Yorkshire Dales, said: "Bookings have been good this year and we are definitely seeing an increase with everything that is going on." Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, said: "For those rightly very worried about the cost-of-living crisis there are many things to do at no or very little cost in Cornwall."
