Nicola Peltz Beckham, 27, has posted a heartwarming Instagram photo of herself and her businessman dad Nelson Peltz, 80, sharing a warm embrace.  The actress, who married Brooklyn Beckham, 23, earlier this year, could be seen wearing oversized jeans, which she had paired with a black crop top, while her father opted for a classic look in a white polo shirt, as the pair comforted each other with a hug.  Nicola wrote in view of her 2.7 million followers alongside the sweet family snap: “Thank you for always having my back I love you so much dad.”  It comes just after Nicola opened up to fans on social media about her struggles behind-the-scenes alongside a tearful photo of herself in bed.  The star has not yet revealed what caused her emotional breakdown, but US media outlets have claimed the reported feud between herself and her mother-in-law, Victoria Beckham, 48, could be to blame.  However, the pair seemed cordial with one another on Victoria’s birthday in April.  Express.co.uk has contacted representatives for Victoria and Nicola for comment.
