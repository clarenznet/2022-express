The two 16-year-old boys had got into difficulty at Lough Enagh in Co. Derry, Northern Ireland, on Monday, August 29. PSNI Inspector Brogan said officers were called shortly after 6.25pm to reports of a number of people in difficulty in the water, reports Belfast Live. Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said a rapid response paramedic, five emergency crews, a hazardous area response team and an ambulance officer were dispatched to the scene. NIAS also tasked the air ambulance to attend the incident. Inspector Brogan said: "One male was taken from the water and transferred to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. "A second male was located and recovered from the water after extensive searches by Foyle Search and Rescue and police divers. He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. "One other male was taken to hospital for treatment to injuries, which are not believed to be life threatening. "Three other males were also at the scene, and while they have been left shocked, are not physically injured. "Enquiries are ongoing into this incident, but we believe, at this stage, that this was a tragic drowning incident. Our thoughts are with the families of those affected." It comes as two swimmers drowned earlier this month after getting into difficulty at a beach, despite a huge search and rescue operation. The two people, both in their 50s, were swimming in the water at Ballybunion beach in Co Kerry, Ireland. At around 5pm on August 4, Valentia Coast Guard received a report that a person was having difficulty in the water. A full-scale search and rescue operation was mounted with Clare-based Coast Guard Helicopter R115, Ballybunion Community Rescue Boat Ireland and Kilrush RNLI all being tasked to the scene. Shortly after the first person was taken from the water, a second person was recovered by Ballybunion Community Rescue Boat Ireland after 6pm. Both the man and woman were pronounced dead on the scene shortly after.
