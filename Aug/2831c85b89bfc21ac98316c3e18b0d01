The Russian advance in the Donbas has slowed to a snail's pace and Putin's army faces a major Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kherson region. Independent Russian media reports allege that Sergei Shoigu has now been "side-lined" by the Kremlin. The Russian president is said to be now receiving military briefings directly from his commanders. In its daily bulletin on the war, the UK's Ministry of Defence wrote: "Recent independent Russian media reports have claimed that due to the problems Russia is facing in its war against Ukraine, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu is now being side-lined within the Russian leadership, with operational commanders briefing President Putin directly on the course of the war. "Russian officers and soldiers with first-hand experience of the war probably routinely ridicule Shoigu for his ineffectual and out-of-touch leadership as Russian progress has stalled." They added: "Shoigu has likely long struggled to overcome his reputation as lacking substantive military experience, as he spent most of his career in the construction sector and the Ministry of Emergency Situations."
