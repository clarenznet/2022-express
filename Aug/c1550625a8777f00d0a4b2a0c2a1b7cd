The incident happened on August 23. The flight took off from Birmingham Airport aiming to fly direct to its destination in Antalya, Turkey. Passengers were already feeling disgruntled after their flight was already delayed by eight hours.   A passenger told Birmingham Live the chaos started when the plane hit some turbulence. They said: "While we were all [seated] we noticed something was going on at the front of the plane. We thought someone had hurt themselves in the toilet while experiencing turbulence. "We were told we were landing in Greece due to a medical emergency on board. We weren’t told what part." The plane landed in Thessaloniki, Greece, and stayed on the runway for about an hour waiting for an ambulance to arrive. The passenger added: "People were worried as we’d just been through turbulence and we didn’t know what was happening. "[Passengers] then got frustrated as once we were off the plane no one was updating us. "The crew were amazing but once in the airport it was chaos." The passengers were informed the company's policy does not provide compensation in the event of medical emergencies such as this one.  A Jet2 spokesperson said: "Flight LS1239 from Birmingham to Antalya diverted to Thessaloniki Airport as a precautionary measure on Tuesday, August 23 due to one of the pilots feeling unwell. "A replacement crew were flown to Thessaloniki so that we could get customers on their way to Antalya that same evening. "We communicated this to our customers as soon as possible, and our teams worked extremely hard to look after everyone. "We would like to apologise to anyone affected by this unforeseen delay."
