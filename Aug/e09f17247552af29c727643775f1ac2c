Sylvester Stallone, 76, has slammed the producer of the Rocky films, Irwin Winkler, after it was announced a Rocky spin-off film is in the works. The Hollywood megastar took to Instagram to vent his frustration at the franchise which he claims the producers have “sucked dry.” It comes after another Rocky film is in the works titled, Drago. The actor’s post contained four photos, the first of which showed Irwin as a vampire, sucking blood from the neck of Rocky Balboa (played by Sylvester). In the final slide, the star shared a photo of Rocky punching Drago, the film’s villain, portrayed by Dolph Lundgren from 1985’s Rocky IV.
