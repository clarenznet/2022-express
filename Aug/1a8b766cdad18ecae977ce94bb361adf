Amanda Owen took to Twitter yesterday and addressed life on Ravenseat Farm over the past couple of weeks as she touched on the unpredictable weather the family experienced. Our Yorkshire Farm star boasts an impressive 200,000 followers on the micro-blogging site and tweeted: "All weathers at the moment. "Wet & windy, bright & sunny. Cold & then hot. Weâ€™ve had highs of 34 degrees & lows of 2 degrees in the space of a couple of weeks #yorkshire #shepherdess #weather." She accompanied the post with a series of pictures as the mum-of-nine took a few selfies in varying outfits. One photo showed Amanda in her truck sporting a big coat while another photo saw the shepherdess sporting a t-shirt while out in the fields. The Channel 5 favourite was swiftly inundated with messages as fans gushed over her appearance. Twitter user, @patrickearl tweeted: "Beautiful pics bring on the autumn season." @Nandotherelen commented: "Stunning," while @SteveMc shared: "Beautiful!" While @Juliejugeann wrote: "Ah great to see you back. Great pictures Amanda keep them coming."
