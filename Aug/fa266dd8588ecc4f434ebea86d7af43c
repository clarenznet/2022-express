Jack Brereton, 31, who represents Stoke-on-Trent South, says the synthetic drug MDPV, known as “monkey dust”, is ruining communities. Its low price and popularity among locals has led to Stoke-on-Trent being labelled “the monkey dust capital”.  He has launched a petition calling for the class B drug to be reclassified as class A, which would increase the maximum jail term of 14 years for its manufacture and supply to a life sentence. Stoke-on-Trent has been awarded £5.3million of government cash to tackle its drug problem. But Mr Brereton said: “We must also see penalties increase for the gangs and dealers who think they can get away with it.”
