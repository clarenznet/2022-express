The ship, named USNS William McLean, named after a US Navy physicist who developed the heat-seeking sidewinder missile, is set to arrive at Plymouth Sound at about 9.45am tomorrow (Thursday). It can weigh up to 40,298 tonnes, depending on cargo. The contract to build William McLean was awarded to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company in December 2008.The vessel was launched in 2011 and its home port is the Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey, USA. It is the 12th of 14 cargo/ammunition ships and was designed to deliver fuel, equipment, and supplies to Navy warships at sea. According to Plymouth Live, in December 2016, the ship was sent on a 47-day "surge deployment" to the Mediterranean Sea, and has also been used to help assault and transport ships as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning. The operation was announced by the Pentagon to support the Libyan government against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It is reportedly fitted with 0.5-inch machine guns and can carry two helicopters.    Plymouth Sound has been a hive of activity in recent days after it hosted SailGP, an international catamarans sailing competition. The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, joined sailor Ben Ainslie at the event. The event saw thousands of spectators visit Plymouth Hoe. There are also numerous events scheduled in the area in the upcoming weeks, according to the Plymouth Sound National Marine Park website. In addition to ships of the Royal Navy, large commercial vessels, including ferries to France and Spain use the Sound from Millbay Docks. Fishing vessels use it from Sutton Harbour beside the old town of Plymouth, called the Barbican.
