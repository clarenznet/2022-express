Vice-chancellors in England and Wales say they have to take more undergraduates from countries such as China and India to boost their coffers. They claim the existing fees, frozen at £9,250 since 2017, will be worth only £6,000 by 2025. The number of Chinese students is said to have risen by over a third since 2017, while reports claim there are 13 per cent fewer UK undergraduates. In five years, income from foreign fees has jumped from £19billion to £23billion. More than half the London School of Economics and University College London intakes are said to be from abroad. Vice-chancellor of Gloucester University Stephen Marston said he and others wanted talks on a "long-term viable funding model". Sir David Bell, of Sunderland University, warned tuition fees had to increase if universities were to continue - even at the level they are at now.
