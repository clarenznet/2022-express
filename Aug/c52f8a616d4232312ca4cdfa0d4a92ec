Michael Jackson's children have paid tribute to the late singer on what would have been his 64th birthday with heartwarming Instagram posts. The Thriller hitmaker had three children: Prince, 25, Paris, 24, and Bigi Jackson, 20, who was formerly known as Blanket. Prince and Paris both took to Instagram to share touching tributes to their late father on what would have been his special day. Along with a series of throwback pictures, Prince captioned his Instagram post: "Happy Birthday to the greatest! Miss you more and more but I love you more and more with each day. Thank you for everything." Paris also shared a throwback snap of her father giving her a kiss when she was young, and wrote "hbd" with a heart emoji. Michael died aged 50 in 2009 at his Los Angeles home after a massive overdose of hospital tranquilizer propofol, which had been prescribed by his doctor.
