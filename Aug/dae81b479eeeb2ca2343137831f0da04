Brad Pitt, 58, has been very busy in recent months promoting his latest film, Bullet Train, and yesterday was no different. The Hollywood hunk cut a cool but casual figure in a colourful green suit, accompanied with a blue flannel t-shirt and bright yellow trainers. The Los Angeles premiere marked a return home for the actor after he has been busy around the world in recent weeks for Bullet Train's international premieres. This comes after Brad had to justify himself on the red carpet as he shut down claims he planned to retire from acting. In a recent interview with GQ in which he discussed being in "this last semester or trimester" of his career. In the piece, the Academy Award winner is quoted as saying: "I consider myself on my last leg. This last semester or trimester. What is this section gonna be? And how do I wanna design that?" Brad clarified to Deadline: "No, I mean…I really have to work on my phrasing. "I was just saying, I’m past middle age and I want to be specific about how I spend those last things however they may be."
