Their four-year-old daughter is achieving her ambitions thanks to her new prosthetic blades - and a lot of determination. Mum Danielle, 30, said: "She's always loved horses. Now she has so much confidence, there is nothing stopping her. She's absolutely fearless."  Freya was born with no shin bones due to very rare condition bilateral tibial hemimelia. Danielle and tree surgeon husband Michael Gibbs, 33, were faced with an agonising choice. They could let her undergo painful operations in a bid to create shins, with no guarantee of success, or let surgeons remove her legs, and be fitted with prosthetic limbs.  Finance assistant Danielle, from Llandysul in West Wales, said: "She was always full of smiles. It was a horrendous decision to make but we didn't want to put her through all that." The amputation was carried out in spring of 2019 when Freya was just 18 months old.  She was given heavy NHS prosthetic legs and could not balance properly. When the pandemic struck in March 2020, she was still struggling. But West Ham fan Freya, who has a sister Olivia, 11, was finally given blades in February last year.  Two months ago, she had knee joints fitted into her prosthetic legs too. And she can now ride her pony Princess, which she was given in May. The family have been supported by LimbPower, a charity for amputees and their families. For more information, visit www.limbpower.com
