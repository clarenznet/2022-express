Mick Jagger’s girlfriend Melanie Hamrick has posted some stunning bikini-clad snaps on Instagram as she soaked up the sun. The 35-year-old has been in a relationship with Rolling Stones star Mick, 79, since 2014. They share five-year-old son Deveroux, and Mick also has seven more children with four other women. Posing poolside on a sun lounger, Melanie captioned a series of photos “summer days”. She previously worked as a ballerina in the American Ballet Theatre for 15 years, until she retired in 2019 and became a choreographer.
