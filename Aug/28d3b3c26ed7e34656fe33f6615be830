Britons wanting to travel abroad to European countries will face an extra charge from next year, with non-EU nationals asked to pay seven euro (£5.90). The change comes into force from November 2023, meaning UK holidaymakers have one summer holiday period left before having to apply for the new European Travel and Information Scheme (ETIAS). Every non-European traveller will have to pay the fee and apply on the official website to travel anywhere in the EU. ETIAS visas will then last three years, meaning you won't need to apply every year. The scheme should be fairly straightforward with ETIAS issued in minutes in some cases, however, there are fears it will spark extra queues at borders. The ETIAS aims to improve security at borders, but already the Port of Dover has warned its introduction could cause lengthy delays at the border. The European Commission has said the scheme will have a “minimal effect” on those travelling to the EU, but with months of airport chaos impacting holidays for Britons this year, some are fearing the worst. Once the ETIAS is introduced, will you travel to EU countries? Will you opt for a new holiday destination? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
