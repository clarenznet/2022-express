In the UK, a TV licence is required for watching or recording live TV programmes, on any channel or device. That means if you have a TV, laptop, or other device, you will need a licence to watch and enjoy live programmes, including those in the UK or in other countries. The good news is that only one licence is required per household, so everybody living in one home can watch live TV as long as someone has a valid one. Ukrainians staying with a host family can check if the homeowner has a TV licence, and then use this to watch live programmes. A TV licence is also needed to watch live television online, such as on ITV Hub, but non-live subscription services such as Netflix are fine to watch without one. A TV Licence costs Â£159 per year, and this can be paid in one go or in instalments over 12 months. They can be bought online from the TV Licensing company, and there are discounts and exemptions available, such as for those over 75 years old. Watching or recording live TV without a licence is risky, and those who do so could be fined if they are caught. But getting a licence is straightforward, and offers the chance to watch your favourite TV programmes without stress.
