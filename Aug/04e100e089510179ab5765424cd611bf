Mr Johnson's exit from Number 10 will "bring down the curtain on the Brexit fantasy," according to a commentator. Writing for the Irish Times, Eoin Burke-Kennedy argues that until now Covid and its fallout had provided a "smokescreen" for the damage caused by Britain's "messy, and as yet unfinished" EU exit. In a scathing critique of the UK's decision to leave the bloc, Mr Burke-Kennedy claims Brexit has caused travel chaos and spiralling inflation among other problems. He insists the "fantasy" of Brexit in Britain is over, as shown by a series of byelection defeats, particularly Tiverton and Honiton, which saw an unprecedented 30 percent swing to the Liberal Democrats. The solutions offered by "would-be leader Liz Truss" will fall short of capturing the national spirit and delivering a Brexit worth celebrating, he believes. Mr Burke-Kennedy concluded: "Drummed up in a fervour of nationalism and post-2008 populism but sold as an act of political and economic sovereignty, the Brexit project will go down as one of the great strategic errors in modern British history."
