Penny Lancaster, 51, married Sir Rod Stewart, 77, in 2007 and they share two sons Alastair, 16, and Aiden, ten. Rod has six other children from previous relationships and Penny has taken on the doting step-mother role. Showing off their close relationship, the Loose Women panellist posed for a rare snap with her husband's three daughters on their family holiday in Portofino. She captioned the post in view of her 158,000 Instagram followers: "My #stepdaughters @thekimberlystewart @rubystewart @renee__stewart." The daughters in the snap include Kimberly, 42, Ruby, 35 and Renee, 30. Penny also shared a snap the day before of the whole family together at the harbour on their idyllic getaway.
