  Paula took to Instagram yesterday to update her 474,000 followers on how the evening had unfolded, including video clips from the stunning-looking evening. She wrote: “The Karibu Africa Charity Event was a SUCCESS!! We raised over 500k and on top of that, had so much fun!! @amyheartlive, what an awesome evening.” Paula modelled a blue frock with a bold, asymmetrical cut and a bright red, orange and green floral pattern. She paired the gown with some pointed, bright orange stiletto heels and opted for a bold red lip. The star could be seen posing with friend Amy Green, who was also a big part of the evening, as they celebrated raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity.
