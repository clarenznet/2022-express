Fans will be able to win a posh commemorative tin in a contest to mark the relish's first 100 years. Makers Branston suggest the centenary Braviar can give a "swanky spin" to the traditional cheese and pickle combo, as well as classic blinis and bubbles. However, it will not be available in shops. For devotees to get their hands on a pot they must tell Branston their most unusual pickle pairings. Six lucky winners will receive an exclusive hamper which contains Braviar, branded caviar spoons and a selection of luxury cheese and pickles. Branston sold 17.8 million jars of its regular product last year. It is made from diced veg in a sauce of vinegar, tomatoes, apples and spices. The relish was created by Caroline Graham and her two daughters in their kitchen at Branston Lodge, Staffs, in 1922. Fans include Rolling Stone Keith Richards, broadcaster Jonathan Ross and feuding Oasis rockers Noel and Liam Gallagher. Angharad Wilson Dyer Gough, at Branston, said: "For our 100th birthday we wanted to do something special to pay tribute to Branston's iconic status as one of Britain's best-loved condiments. "We took our iconic taste and created a product that is the epitome of luxury and celebrations."
