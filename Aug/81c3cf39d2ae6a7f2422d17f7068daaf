As well as rustling up some of her best-loved dishes, the national treasure, 87, travels to “spectacular” areas in Britain – and even sails a boat off Dorset’s Jurassic Coast. The former Bake Off judge also meets Britons who know how to use food to bring communities together.  In cities such as Edinburgh and Birmingham, Mary shows locals how to wow with a lamb casserole, roast tin spice chicken and a chocolate truffle dessert, bottom right. Reflecting on her show, Mary Berry Cook And Share, the culinary guru said: “Sharing recipes is always an utter joy for me and this series is the ultimate guide, whether you’re cooking for a crowd or just for two. “I have always believed there is no better way to spend time with family and friends than over fresh home-cooked food – and now more than ever that feels so important.” But the six-part programme is not her only TV appearance next month.  Mary will turn up on Celebrity MasterChef for the semi-final on Thursday, September 8 – to help decide which stars know their creme patissiere from their creme anglaise. The remaining contestants will be charged with recreating one of Dame Mary’s “favourite and delicious signature classic recipes”. The famous faces battling it out in the kitchen this week include Strictly professional Katya Jones, former model and radio presenter Lisa Snowdon, as well as Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas.
