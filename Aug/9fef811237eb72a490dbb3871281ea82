Alex Scott has taken to Instagram to share a series of steamy snaps after she enjoyed a break at a fitness retreat in Portugal. The BBC Sports presenter, 37, displayed her enviably toned body as she stood under an outside shower while soaking up the sun. In the second snap, Alex donned a vibrant orange bikini and black shirt as she posed playfully for the snap. Another picture showed her with pal and Countdown star Carol Vorderman as they posed in the gym together. The star told her 1.7 million followers: "Took some time to cool off. "Another magical stay at @jasonvale @juicemasterretreats and it really is an escape, reset & recharge all in one. "Tested out the new SuperPods this time for Jason and I b****y loved it," she finished.
