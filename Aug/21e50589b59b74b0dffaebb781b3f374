The Foreign Secretary - favourite to be the next Prime Minister - said Government must urgently breathe life into the economy as "people are struggling". The CBI business group urged ministers to do more to help with the cost of living.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he expected an emergency Budget when the next PM starts. The ally of Ms Truss also criticised the Bank of England for not controlling inflation. She said yesterday: "We're facing a recession if we carry on with our business-asusual policies. People are struggling...that's why it's very important we reverse the national insurance increase, we have a temporary moratorium on the green energy levy. "I know it's going to be a tough winter." More people see Ms Truss's rival Rishi Sunak as being better at ending any recession, a YouGov poll found. Some 19 percent of respondents picked the former chancellor, compared with 12 percent for her, but almost half (46) said "neither".
