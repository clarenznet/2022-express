Former patients of Tony Dixon claim they were left physically and mentally damaged after the "unnecessary" operations. Hundreds with bowel problems had contacted the pioneering surgeon. Mr Dixon, who faces dozens of negligence claims, has failed in his High Court attempt to stay anonymous in a case. He is suing ex-employer Southmead NHS Hospital in Bristol to try to stop documents being released to former patients' solicitors, the BBC said. His lawyer had reportedly said that if Mr Dixon was identified it could harm his mental health, adding that he had suffered suicidal thoughts. His legal team claimed he was also experiencing problems with his libido due to media attention, the BBC said. But Mr Justice Nicklin ruled the attention was the "price to be paid for open justice and the freedom of the press". Ex-patient Paula Goss, who set up the Rectopexy Mesh Victims and Support group for women treated by Mr Dixon, called his claims "outrageous". She said: "Why should he be allowed to have an anonymous trial? We have to live our lives with what he did, we have to see him out in the world causing distress. "It's more than just the fact he's complaining about suicidal thoughts and depression, which many of his victims suffer from, it's that he said we don't even matter. "People have waited so long since the review in 2017 for justice [some] have since passed away. It's because he's been in the media that people who have been suffering realised that they can get support and can get justice." A review by hospital chiefs said more than 200 of Mr Dixon's patients should have been offered less invasive treatment first. The General Medical Council is to hold an inquiry into the operations. The North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs Southmead, dismissed him in 2019.
