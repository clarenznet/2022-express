More than 10,000 members are thought to have backed the “Boris ballot” campaign to change the leadership rules to insert the outgoing Prime Minister's name as a candidate in the final round. But former Tory MEP David Campbell-Bannerman, who was coordinating the drive with Conservative Peer Lord Cruddas, said they had been “unable to deliver a Boris ballot in the short time we have”. Printed members’ ballots arrived on Monday, with the option of supporting either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss as the next party leader and Prime Minister. In the wake of defeat, Mr Campbell-Bannerman said: “I ask all those who have supported the Boris ballot campaign not to spoil their ballots. Please don’t write Boris on the ballot etc, don’t destroy the ballot or just not vote.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
