Opposites Attract hitmaker Paula Abdul, 60, wowed with her jaw-dropping ageless looks as she attended the premiere of Prey at Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The star put on a stunning display of her toned legs alongside 25-year-old actress and Prey lead, Amber Midthunder.  Paula wore a stylish short-sleeved tricolour mini dress, which she paired with white pointed-toe heels.  The singer, who celebrated her 60th birthday just weeks ago, accessorised her outfit with gold and pearl hoops and a gold bracelet.  Meanwhile, Amber wore a pink floral gown with an elegant high collar.  Prey is the fifth instalment in the Predator movie franchise and tells the tale of a Comanche warrior (Midthunder) who protects her tribe from the Predator.
