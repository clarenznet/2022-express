The final phase of the family’s legal battle to keep Archie on life support saw the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refuse an application from his parents to delay any changes to his treatment. Judges said they “would not interfere” with the ruling of UK courts. This came after the UK Supreme Court ruled that the High Court was right to agree with Barts Health NHS Trust doctors about the treatment not being in Archie’s best interests. The 12-year-old boy was found unconscious with a ligature around his neck at his home on April 7. His mother believes he may have been taking part in an online challenge at the time. Archie has not since regained consciousness. His mother, Hollie Dance, said: “I would like him out of here as quick as possible really, and in a peaceful hospice to say goodbye and spend time with his family, uninterrupted by the noise and chaos.” Doctors, quoted in the BBC, have, however, warned there is “considerable risk” in moving him. A July High Court order also requires that Archie remains at the London hospital while his treatment is withdrawn.

But the spokeswoman added that a hospice had said it would take the young boy.

Archie’s mother added: “It was the last thing, wasn't it? And again our country has failed a 12-year-old child.” The young boy’s family say his life-support treatment will be turned off at 11am today unless an application over the hospice move is submitted by 9am.
