Martin Godfrey, 57, drove into Paul Doody after a confrontation, during which the cyclist knocked his wing mirror. It resulted in Mr Doody being thrown over his handlebars and over a wall. Although the victim only suffered minor injuries, Godfrey lost his job and was hauled before a court yesterday to face assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving charges. Cardiff Crown Court heard the motorist was "driving far too close" to Mr Doody and, when they stopped at traffic lights, Mr Doody's elbow touched the wing mirror of Godfrey's car. The cyclist then slapped the wing mirror in order to draw the driver's attention to how close his car was to him. However, the defendant continued to drive alongside Mr Doody's bike, which the victim found "intimidating", on June 27 in Penylan, Cardiff.They exchanged insults with each other and footage played to the judge showed Godfrey eventually mow the victim to the ground, WalesOnline reports.However, Godfrey's eight-month jail term was suspended for two years yesterday.Recorder Carl Harrison said: "This was a deliberate moved to knock a cyclist of his bike after he hit you on the bonnet.... You did this out of anger, you lost your temper. You were in a car, he was a cyclist, you have a responsibility to other road users, particularly those more vulnerable than you." Godfrey initially drove off after the impact but returned to the scene of the collision and spoke to witnesses, claiming the victim had attacked him first but was told by a bystander "he hit your vehicle, he didn't hit you". Ieuan Bennett, prosecuting, said: "The defendant was driving far too close to him giving him no room at all."During the foul-mouthed exchange, Godfrey said: "Don't touch my f****** car", to which Mr Doody replied: "You're too f****** close, move away, move the f*** away". He was also heard calling Godfrey a "f****** c***" and a "fat f***".Police were called and Godfrey appeared agitated, confused and breathless. He told police he drove away because he was "physically unwell" and wanted to avoid a confrontation between him and Mr Doody.As a result of the assault, Mr Doody suffered tenderness to his left collarbone and left shoulder joint, as well as swelling and reduced movement. The defendant, of Traherne Drive, Michaelston-super-Ely, was interviewed and denied assaulting the victim but he later pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving. The court heard he had previous convictions for wounding, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and failure to surrender. Kevin Seal, efending, said his client had acted "out of character".He added: "This was a moment of madness." The defence barrister said it was the "last thing Mr Godfrey wished" was to cause injury to Mr Doody. He said the "mainstay" of his life had been his job as a taxi driver but as a result of this incident he has lost his job.Godfrey was also ordered to carry out a 10-day rehabilitation activity requirement and 120 hours of unpaid work. The defendant was also disqualified from driving for two years.
