  Barney's lead snapped in the collision, and he was dragged under the vehicle.Traumatised Denise says she pounded on the car's window, pleading with the driver to stop, but they ignored her and fled the scene.She said neighbours up to 100 metres away could hear her dog's screams, meaning the driver "almost certainly heard them too".Barney was lying motionless in the road, which left his owner fearing the worst.   Denise said: "He was rolling and screaming, then he suddenly flopped sideways and I thought he was dead. I can't stop reliving it in my head. "I picked him up and he started squealing. I sat down on some steps, as we were near my house, and phoned my son and said 'get me to the vet quick' and he came running across and we got him in the car." Barney had a series of x-rays which revealed he had five major fractures to his pelvis. His hip and left hind leg were dislocated from his spine. Multiple scans followed and Barney underwent surgery to reattach his leg and hip to his spine. Denise's son, Steve, 43, said: "They had to bolt them back on. They were completely snapped off the spinal column."   The next day, Barney came home to recuperate in familiar surroundings - to the delight of their eight-year-old rescue bulldog, Bumble. Denise said: "While Barney was away, Bumble was very agitated. He kept going to his bed and looking." A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said no arrests had been made in relation to the incident, which happened at 11am on August 12.
