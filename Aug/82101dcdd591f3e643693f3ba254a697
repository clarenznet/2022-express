Victoria Beckham, 48, has taken to Instagram with a snap of herself on a night out as she daringly showed off some skin for her social media fans. The star then shared more snaps alongside her husband David Beckham.  The pair were joined by a host of friends as they enjoyed what looked like a nice day out together in the sun.  In the first snap, Victoria was joined by a model friend as the pair clutched their drinks and posed for a photo.  The fashion designer was dressed in a black mini dress and her hair in a ponytail as she showed off her tanned legs.  In the following snap, David could be seen looking dapper in a crisp blue shirt and dark shades, while Victoria switched up into a green dress and black sandals.
