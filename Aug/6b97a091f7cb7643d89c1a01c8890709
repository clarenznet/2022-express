Sebastien Bowen, 42, said the bowel cancer activist tucked it in a book for him to discover following her death. He confided: “She wrote about why she loved me so much, what a wonderful life we had shared together and why we should have no regrets. That was the best thing she could have given me. It totally knocked me over.” He is spending August with their children, Hugo, 14, and Eloise, 12, in Deborah’s “magic place” in France. Sebastien said: “It’s bitter-sweet with memories of her at every turn. We are trying to be there for each other.” The banker also said the family were closer after sharing their “raw selves, the good, the bad, the ugly” in her final days. Dame Deborah’s legacy also includes a record 175,000 people coming forward for bowel cancer checks. The figures, revealed today, span May, when she revealed she had stopped treatment, to July. Former deputy head Dame Deborah died in June.
