More than 1,100 people have died and hundreds more injured when one-third of Pakistan was completely submerged by water. When asked by reporters if the UK will be sending a package of aid, the Prime Minister said: “Yes of course, and I can tell you that our sympathies are very much with the people of Pakistan.” He described the “devastation” in the country as “absolutely heart-rending”. Mr Johnson said: “Pakistan is traditionally one of the biggest recipients of UK overseas aid and we will of course make sure that we send a fitting package commensurate with the vital relationship that there is between the UK and Pakistan and people’s natural sympathies with those who have been affected by the floods.” UN secretary general Antonio Guterres labelled the floods “a climate catastrophe” as he called for global action to help the country. In a video message to launch a major UN appeal to help victims, Mr Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids – the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding”. He launched a £137 million appeal to help provide 5.2 million affected people with food, water, sanitation, emergency education, protection and health support.
