Chiefs are attempting to stop the party, scheduled to take place at Premier Banqueting Suite in Burmantofts, Leeds, soon. The same venue was served an abatement notice by the council last month following a series of complaints about noise, and now residents have expressed their ire at the latest plans. That means it has to take action to limit noise going forward. Businesses that fail to comply with such a notice risk being taken to court and fined. A licensing hearing next Wednesday will decide whether or not the party, which is scheduled for mid-October, can go ahead as planned, Leeds Live reports. Details in an application form to the city council, which appear to have been written by a member of the family hoping to hold the party, said: “Hello. I want to celebrate the baptism of my son and I would like to have a permit from you until after 12 at night. "The local (authority) has told us we can only be there until 12. I request your permission to celebrate until 5 or 6 in the morning if possible. Thanks a lot.” Further down the application form, 5am was clarified as the cut-off the time the family is seeking.  But in their objection to the application, Elizabeth Hebbert from the council’s environmental protection team, said: “Previous events at the Premier Banqueting Suite have given rise to multiple complaints about noise from guests leaving the premises in the early hours. Owing to the likelihood of noise nuisance issues occurring, an abatement notice was served on the Premier Banqueting Suite on July 27.” The officers’ letter said they feared the baptism party may cause a disturbance, “Based on the history of noise issues from late events held at the premises, the proximity of nearby residences, and the event’s late finishing time.”
