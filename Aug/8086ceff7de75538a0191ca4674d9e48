Royal Mail staff from several company departments have voted to strike, with industrial action starting this week. The first walkouts strangled services today, leaving households across the country without letter deliveries. Britons will see postal services interrupted during several more days over the next two weeks. The CWU held its first walkouts today, August 26, with 115,000 Royal Mail staff on strike. Their absence meant postal workers did not deliver letters while the company prioritised priory packages. Any correspondence they don't receive today should arrive over the weekend, but some disruption will continue.

The CWU is locked in a pay dispute with the Royal Mail, which it claims offered workers a pay rise worth "up to 5.5 percent". Union chiefs want their members to receive compensation in line with inflation. Inflation recently reached 10.1 percent - a 40-year high - and analysts believe it could pass 13 percent this year, rendering the Royal Mail offer a real terms pay cut.
