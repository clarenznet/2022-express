The 20-month-old girl was with her parents when she was struck on the head by the huge ball of solid ice and rushed to hospital. According to reports, the toddler who was injured was transferred to another hospital in the nearby city of Girona but later died from her injuries. Around 50 other people were hurt with reports of head injuries, broken bones, cuts and bruising. One woman was still being treated yesterday. The storm, which lasted 10-minutes, hit the Girona region of Catalonia on Tuesday evening, shredding roofs, downing power cables and shattering windows. The sound of the hail – some the size of melons – was deafening. Catalonia weather experts said one of the hailstones measured four inches in diameter - the largest to hit the region since 2002. Firefighters received more than 40 calls from members of the public about damage, mainly from the town of Bisbal d’Emporda.  Town Mayor Carme Vall told local radio: “The hail only fell for 10 minutes, but it was 10 minutes of terror.” Officials have now reissued violent weather alerts, warning residents more large hailstones could affect the coastal area. The meteorological service says hailstorms can occur throughout the year but are most frequently between March and September. An unusually hot summer has meant the nearby Mediterranean sea is warmer than usual, making violent tropical storms more likely. The deadliest-known hailstorm in history hit the Indian city of Moradabad in 1888 – killing nearly 250 people.
