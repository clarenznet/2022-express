Britain's next Prime Minister will be announced on September 5, with Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss both vying for the top job. Whoever takes over the role will be doing so at a crucial time for the country, as the cost of living crisis continues to spiral. Ofgem announced the energy price cap will rise by 80 percent to £3,549 a year in October, potentially pushing hundreds of thousands into fuel poverty this winter. Mr Sunak has said he will target the soaring inflation rate, while Ms Truss has said tax cuts will aid those struggling with increasing costs. This winter all households will get £400 to help with energy bills, however, campaigners are arguing the Government needs to do more to alleviate pressure on already stretched Britons. Other pressing matters for the new Tory leader include the ongoing Russian war on Ukraine and the continued frustration over the Northern Ireland protocol. Ms Truss could trigger Article 16 within days if she is appointed Prime Minister, a move which would see the UK suspend parts if not all of the protocol. The deadline for the UK to respond to legal action launched by the EU over the Irish Sea border checks is September 15, just 10 days after the new Prime Minister is announced. While Mr Sunak has pledged to "fix" the Northern Ireland protocol, saying earlier this month: "Moving into the future starts with fixing the protocol and talking with all parties and fixing the differences and bringing people together."
