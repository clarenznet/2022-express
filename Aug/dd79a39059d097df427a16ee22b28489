Donna D'Errico, who starred as Donna Marco in the hit series Baywatch, took to Instagram and put her toned figure on full display as the age-defying beauty donned a tiny bikini on Tuesday. The 54-year-old was seen in a video where she posed in a revealing hot pink two piece set with little black and white ties on her briefs while in her bedroom. In her caption, the ex-wife of Nikki Sixx of the heavy metal band Mötley Crüe said she is not near perfect "but I’m feeling pretty damn good". The former Playboy model was seen in the bedroom of her Los Angeles home as she took her time to turn a full 360 degrees flaunting her toned legs, sculpted arms and taut abs. Her post comes after the ageless star hit out at critics who told her she was "too old". On July 17, she penned: "Quite a few women complained about the 4th of July video I posted in a red white & blue bikini because they thought I was 'classier than that' and 'too old to wear a bikini' and, my favorite, 'desperate'. "Let me tell you something that might surprise you. I can actually wear and do literally whatever I want. On that note, here is me in a bikini squatting on a coffee table."
