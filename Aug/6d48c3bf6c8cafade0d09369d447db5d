Eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters rushed to the scene to tackle the blaze at Wanstead Flats near Davies Lane, in Leytonstone. Around four hectares of grassland were damaged from the blaze alight. Firefighters were first called for the fire at 1.09pm. At the time, London Fire Brigade urged people to avoid the area. The Brigade said it had taken more than 30 calls to the blaze. Fire crews from Walthamstow, Woodford, Leytonstone, Homerton and surrounding fire stations attended the scene.  The cause of the fire is being investigated. Onlookers have posted footage on social media showing the blaze burning the dry land, and the sad results of the burnt grass. Firefighters managed to put the blaze under control shortly after 3pm. There were no reports of injuries as a result of the fire. A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: "Crews worked incredibly hard to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby properties. "Although the temperature has dropped, grasslands will still be extremely dry. We don’t want people to be complacent and that means avoiding barbecuing in parks and open spaces, ensuring cigarettes are properly disposed of and clearing away rubbish and glass as they can magnify the sun and cause a fire.”
