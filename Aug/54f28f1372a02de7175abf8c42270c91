Ekin-Su Culculoglu, 27, appeared on Loose Women today with fellow Love Island winner Davide Sanclimenti, 27, to discuss what is next for the pair. However, fans were left distracted by Ekin's very low cut red dress. The brunette beauty6 stunned in the shoulderless red dress, exposing her rather ample assets. As the interview continued, Loose Women viewers took to Twitter to share their concern as her dress began to lower. Kirstenmavric wrote: "Are the producers packing yet about Ekin-Su's top slipping down? @loosewomen." Former Britain's Got Talent star Francine Lewis added: "Watching #LooseWomen with @ekinsuofficial and im not sure if her nipple has popped out lol #LoveIsland."
