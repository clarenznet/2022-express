Tess Daly, 53, has taken to Instagram to share snaps from her recent Ibiza holiday with her husband Vernon Kay. The Strictly Come Dancing presenter looked amazing in a red swimsuit, which featured a halter neck and showed off Tess' incredible gym-honed figure. She sat on board the private boat as she flaunted her enviably toned long legs as she held on to a gold rubber ring. Tess captioned the post in view of her 803,000 Instagram followers: "Missing Ibiza, but feeling fresh and ready for a busy week, hope everyoneâ€™s having a lovely Monday!" The presenter also shared a snap of her husband Vernon Kay alongside DJ's Pete Tong and Calvin Harris as they watched their performance on the island.
