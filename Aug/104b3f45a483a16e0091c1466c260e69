The Department for Work and Pensions is launching a scheme to enable internet and mobile service providers to check - with a customer's permission - whether they receive benefits which entitles them to a reduced rate.  Virgin Media O2 has already signed up and ministers are hoping that other providers will now follow suit. While many providers already offer so-called "social tariffs", the take-up rate is low with just 1 percent of those eligible applying. Currently claimants have to prove their entitlement as often as every month.
