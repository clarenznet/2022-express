Vitamin D can enter the body in two forms, through diet or through the skin because of ultraviolet light. When it is absorbed, it does wonders. But a study published in the journal Nutrients suggests a deficiency in it is associated with a “higher risk” of sleeping disorders. The research that looked at the link between vitamin D deficiency and sleep in over 9,000 participants, found several alerting trends. People with the deficiency had a higher risk of conditions like insomnia. They also had worse and shorter sleep. The academics looked at convincing research from across the world as part of a review. They used these studies to come up with solid conclusions about the relationship between sleep disorders and vitamin D deficiency. Although they spotted the pattern, the researchers noted that more research is necessary to explain the link.
