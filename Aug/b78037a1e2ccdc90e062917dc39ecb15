MPs who have endorsed the former Chancellor are facing talks from Ms Truss's team as more Tory party members receive their ballot papers. “We are staying in contact with MPs of all stripes, including some Rishi supporters, to try to convince them to come over,” a Truss campaign source told The Telegraph. One MP to have made the move is James Evans, Tory MP for Brecon and Radnorshire. He said: "At the start of the Leadership contest I was backing Rishi but as this has gone on there is only one person to unite the country and the party and that is Liz Truss."
