EA has revealed today FIFA 23 fans will be getting some special FUT items thanks to a new promotion involving Marvel. These two titans of the world of entertainment have teamed up for the FUT Heroes event in FIFA 23, which will see iconic players such as Yaya Toure and Park Ji-Sung receive special illustrated FUT items. These eye-catching new FIFA 23 FUT items will be available when the World Cup mode launches, while the base version of FUT Heroes will be available at the FIFA 23 launch. Other cosmetics linked to players being imagined as Marvel Heroes will also be launched such as tifos, kits and balls. FIFA 23 fans will also be able to flick through an online Marvel Heroes comic book, while a physical version will be released at a later date.
