Lizzo, 34, stunned in a large billowing gown by famous designer, Jean Paul Gaultier, as she took to the red carpet for the MTV VMA Awards 2022. She teamed the bold gown with a pair of sheer navy gloves, leaving the hitmaker commanding more attention on the red carpet. The American singer wore her dark hair slicked back away from her face, creating a wet hairstyle that flowed down her back. She teamed the vibrant look with bold black lipstick, a lip ring and layered gold earrings. Lizzo commented on her large dress on Twitter in view of her 2 million followers. She captioned the post along with three snaps: "My stylist: How much fabric do you wanna wear? Me: Yes."
