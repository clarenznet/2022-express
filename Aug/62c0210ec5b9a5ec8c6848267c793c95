The Russian President is preparing an emergency evacuation plan in preparation for the eventuality that Ukraine emerges victorious, according to bombshell new claims. The General SVR Telegram channel, purportedly run by a Kremlin insider, revealed: "Putin himself and his entourage are preparing plans for evacuation from Russia." Alleged evacuation plans would mean dictator Putin and his family being carried out of Russia and into Syria, the nearest friendly state, but would mean flying through the airspace of NATO member Turkey. Should Turkish president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan refuse Putin's flight access to the airspace, he would effectively scupper the entire evacuation. Iran is another country that could be interested in the fate of Putin, with President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish leader Erdogan allegedly discussing what they would do should Putin require asylum. One message read: "In principle, it is beneficial for Iran and Turkey to keep the Russian president in exile in reserve, using him, depending on the situation, as a lever or as a bargaining chip."
