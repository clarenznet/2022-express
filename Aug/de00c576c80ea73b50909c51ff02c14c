Joan Collins, 89, showcased her age-defying looks as she could be seen bopping away to Blondie in her backyard pool. The star was dressed in a plunging blue two-piece as she shared the short clip to her 283,000 followers. She wrote in the caption: “Nothing like having #funinthesun! “#poollife #southoffrance #poolside #hotweather #coolingoff." Joan soaked in the most of the sun as she jived away to Heart of Glass in her St Tropez villa. To shield herself from the sun, the actress wore a straw sunhat and dark shades, as her husband Percy Gibson, 57, could be heard filming in the background.
