Prince William, Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte were all smiles on Tuesday as they watched the swimming and hockey events at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and paid a visit to one of Kate's patronages. In the stands, Charlotte looked gripped by all the action, and she showed off some fantastic facial expressions throughout!
