Amanda Holden, 51, captioned a snap of herself riding a bike in Tresco, Isles of Scilly, with the comment: " Love this place. My fave in the world." She added delightedly: "No cars, great people, fab food, no fuss... just peace and family time." The Britain's Got Talent judge was clearly a million miles away from the showbiz world on her remote break, but still managed to look as sensational as ever as she flaunted her much-celebrated figure. On the red carpet this year, Amanda has flaunted everything from latex fetishwear by the brand Honour to a tiny tennis outfit in honour of Wimbledon, and much more besides. However she enjoyed her break in a much more casual outfit, with trainers and a tiny pair of green denim shorts. Amanda also showcased the Breton style when she donned a chic oversized striped shirt in a special nod to her location.
