The Tory leadership hopeful is facing a battle against the Bank of England (BoE) if she is successful in her bid for the top job after suggesting she will hand ministers the power to override City regulators, widely seen to be holding back post-Brexit reforms. The Foreign Secretary will allow ministers to "call in" regulatory decisions in the public interest if they feel watchdogs are being excessively cautious. Leadership rival Rishi Sunak has also promised to push ahead with this policy. The former Chancellor and his ally John Glen, former City minister, infuriated BoE governor Andrew Bailey by proposing the “call in” power as part of a new financial services bill. The “call in” power is expected to be added to the financial services bill as it passes through parliament, although Mr Bailey is expected to fight a rearguard action against what he sees as regulatory interference.
