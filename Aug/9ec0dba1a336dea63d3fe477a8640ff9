Argentine polo player Nacho Figueras said the Duchess of Sussex was "working hard" on Archetypes, which was released on Spotify on Tuesday. He added that Meghan was taking on "important" topics in her long-awaiting podcast as he congratulated her. Mr Figueras made the comments after a charity polo match in Aspen, Colorado, on Thursday, which the former Suits star did not attend. The polo player said: "She is always there, they have two very young children. "She's also working very hard on her podcast that I want to congratulate her on. "Sometimes the team has to divide to go on duty. "That's the only reason she's not here, but she's always here in spirit." Asked if he liked her new podcast, Mr Figueras replied: "I do. "I think that she means well, she really wants to empower women and attack certain subjects that I think are important. "So I wish her the best and I know that she cares about making the world a better place." Meghan was joined by tennis player and close friend Serena Williams for the first episode of her podcast. The pair discuss the double standards women face when they are labelled "ambitious". Opening up on her own experience, Meghan says: "I don't remember ever personally feeling the negative connotation behind the word ambitious until I started dating my now husband." Archetypes aims to "investigate, dissect and subvert the labels that try to hold women back". The Duchess said: "I know a thing or two about those labels myself. "My hope is that my own lived experience will help other women open up." The podcast is part of the lucrative deal the Sussexes signed with Spotify when they quit as working royals in 2020 for a new life in the US. Sussex fans have been eagerly awaiting further content after Harry and Meghan released a single podcast episode in December 2020. The Duchess's new podcast has topped Spotify's charts in countries around the world including the UK and the US.
