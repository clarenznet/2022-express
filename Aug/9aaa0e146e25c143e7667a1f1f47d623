With people jetting off on their summer holidays it's important to know airline check-in requirements. Passengers are being warned that, for Ryanair, you should check in online rather than in person. Online check-in opens 60 days before the scheduled departure time if you have purchased an allocated seat. Customers can be allocated a seat free of charge if they check in online between 24 and two hours before each booked flight, the Liverpool Echo reports. You cannot check in online during the two hours before your flight’s scheduled departure time. Ryanair passengers who arrive at the airport without having checked in online will have to pay a £55 fine. Once you have checked in online you can print copies of your boarding pass, or download them to your mobile phone, up to two hours before the scheduled departure time. Your boarding pass must be printed on a single A4 page or downloaded through the Ryanair app. If not you could face a fine. Ryanair does operate airport check-in but charges apply. Customers who have not checked in online will encounter an airport check-in fee, which is £/€55 (for flights from Spain €/£ 30) per passenger. If you have checked in but you have not printed your boarding pass or have it downloaded on the Ryanair app, you will be charged for the boarding pass reissue fee, which is £/€20 per passenger.    It's also important to note some airports do not accept Ryanair's mobile boarding passes.
