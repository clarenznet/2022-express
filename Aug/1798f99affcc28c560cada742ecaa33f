Dolph Lundgren, 64, embraced the Californian summer in a casual black T-shirt and a pair of white shorts alongside his fiancée Emma Krokdal, 25.  The Rocky IV star, who rose to fame in Sylvester Stallone’s hit film, showed off his youthful energy by accessorising with black trainers and silver chains.  His social media influencer partner opted for a similarly summery display as she stepped out with her beau to run errands in West Hollywood.  Emma put her toned abs on display in a black crop top, which she paired with green cargo shorts, oversized sunglasses, and white Yeezys.  The couple seemed relaxed in one another’s company, after announcing their engagement in an Instagram post on June 29 2020.
