Madonna, 63, draped her body in crystals and sparkly gems after stripping to just her underwear - a corset and a pair of tiny pants. The fur coat-clad star stood alongside Beyonce, 40, who perched totally nude on a furry rug, with just a pair of strategically placed glittery pasties covering her modesty. Meanwhile, the holographic horse from Beyonce's album promo shots stood lit up alongside them. In further footage published to Madonna's Instagram account of the "Queens Remix", she dressed up in a Marie Antoinette style costume, while Beyonce made her appearance in a spectacular glittering leotard. The words "Queen mother Madonna I love ya" then appeared on the screen. The remix of Beyonce's hit single looks likely to be hugely popular throughout the rest of the summer.
