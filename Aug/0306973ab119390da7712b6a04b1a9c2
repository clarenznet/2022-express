The 57-year-old put on an animated display as she could be seen frolicking around in the pool, while another scene saw the beauty screaming during a bumpy car journey. Written by Phillipe Martinez and Nathalie Cox, the film will follow Rachel (played by Liz), a hopeless romantic who is jilted at the altar. Not to let her Christmas in the Caribbean honeymoon go to waste, Rachel and her two bridesmaids jet off to the islands, where love blossoms and she has to make a life choice. The cast also includes Bridgerton's Caroline Quentin and My Dad's Christmas Date's actress Nathalie. “An offer to shoot a movie in the Caribbean, after more than 18 months of lockdowns, was irresistible,” Liz told Variety, “‘Christmas in the Caribbean’ is a fun, lively antidote to all that misery.” Christmas in the Caribbean is set to be released in November.
