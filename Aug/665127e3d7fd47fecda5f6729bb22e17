Firefighters rushed to the small, sandy beach in Durgan, Cornwall, after residents spotted the flames. One local, Guy Potter, said a group of youths had made a campfire in among the dry grass and trees by the shore. They fled, though, and the flames quickly spread.  Locals ran out with buckets of water to put the fire out. The beach has recently gained popularity with tourists, after it was featured on a podcast and also on social media. But Mr Potter told Cornwall Live people have discarded campfires on the beauty spot in the past, and residents are fed up. He shared a photo with CornwallLive where multiple campfires can be seen burning on the beach. "It's been quite bad over the weekend," he said. "We've been trying to solve it. This area has become really popular for wild swimming, stand up paddle boarding, and all sorts. There's been an issue here ever since people started location tagging it. "And someone recently did a podcast about it. It's the perfect storm really." Mr Potter went on to say that the beach has capacity for a few hundred people at most over a few days. But, as of late, it's been visited by thousands sometimes in a day.  "Taking the mick a bit," Mr Potter added. "The busier it gets, people start behaving more extremely and the National Trust are overwhelmed. "The area is becoming a bit of a theme park. And when people see others misbehaving it escalates, we've had emergency laybys all full, if something goes wrong they couldn't get down or turn around." On the brush near the beach, the National Trust has a sign telling people not to smoke or light fires. The sign reads: "Risk of wildfires", but, according to Mr Potter, people ignore the warnings.
