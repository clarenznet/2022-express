  Liz showed off her long legs in a white summer dress with a stunning floral design and plunging neckline. The star couldn’t stop smiling as she posed alongside a total of six sweet puppies, who were all fighting for her attention in a video she uploaded to Instagram in view of her 2.4 million followers. One picture showed Liz cradling a pup under each arm, while another showed one of the dogs trying to lick her face as she held it close. Liz captioned the cuteness overload: “Puppy love forever”.
