  Irinia wowed her 19 million followers as she got on her knees for an impromptu photoshoot on a boardwalk. The star wore a patterned triangle bikini top and some skimpy matching bottoms. Another picture saw her hanging out by the water with Riccardo Tisci, who is the Chief Creative Officer at Burberry. The model also shared a cute snap of herself and Riccardo having fun with some other bikini-clad pals as they went for a dip in the sea.
