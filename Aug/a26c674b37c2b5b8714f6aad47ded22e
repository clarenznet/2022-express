Sharon Osbourne, 69, has posted some behind the scenes photos with her husband Ozzy, who closed the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham last night. Ozzy put on an energetic performance in spite of his Parkinsonâ€™s battle as well as recovering from a major back operation. The Prince of Darkness joined guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Tommy Clufetos and bassist Adam Wakeman to perform the heavy metal band's classic, Paranoid. The hitmaker took to the stage and performed in his signature eye-catching makeup at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham to mark the end of the 11-day sporting event.
