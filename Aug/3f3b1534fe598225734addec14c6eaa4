Most people will have felt the impact of the ongoing cost of living as supermarket prices soared in recent weeks. In fact, the price of several key items has almost doubled - including Lurpak, with reports emerging of one store selling the spread for nearly a tenner. According to the Manchester Evening News, Money Saving Central shared the deal on its Facebook page this morning, racking up dozens of comments from shoppers asking family members to stock up. The post read: “Lurpak is only £3 at Iceland for the next 7 days!!!!!” The deal says it will save shoppers £1.49 per tub, however, in June the Mirror reported that the same pack was being sold for £5 in the supermarket.   Both the Slightly Salted and Lighter Slightly Salted 500g tubs of Lurpak are available in the offer, making them cheaper to buy than the 1kg tub at £7.25. Smaller 250g blocks are also on sale for £2.50, but this works out at £10 per kilo, so you’re definitely better off buying the £3 tubs. What’s more is that Lurpak is suitable for home freezing, meaning you really can stock up while it’s at the lower price, pulling out a new tub when you’ve finished the old one, so that nothing goes to waste - but you’ll have to be quick as the offer will run out next week.  Or, alternatively, you could even try to make your own butter like MyLondon reporter - Rory Murray. He, and several readers, recently shared their attempts at making butter at home, in an attempt to save money as costs rise. Or you could even try other brands, rather than Lurpak. NottinghamshireLive reporter, Sanjeeta Bains offered her take on the best alternative brands for fans of Lurpak, ranking them from best to worst.
