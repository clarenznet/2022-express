Gary Bennett, 36, is accused of killing Madison Wright, 30, who vanished on Friday. Southend Magistrates' Court heard a body was found in Wat Tyler Country Park in Pitsea, Essex, and police arrested Bennett on Friday, and charged him over the weekend. He appeared in court in a grey, prison issue jumper with a shaved head with moustache and goatee beard today. During the short hearing, he could be seen crying in the dock. The case was sent to Basildon Crown Court on August 3, during which time Bennett will remain in custody. Chairman of the magistrates' bench Colin Adams told the suspect: "We have no jurisdiction to deal with this matter today, this will be heard on August 3 at Basildon Crown Court where your bail application will be heard over the judge at the time. You will be remanded in custody until that time." Door to door enquiries were carried out by Essex Police in Pitsea after the discovery. Speaking over the weekend, a spokesman for the country park said: "[The park] has closed today, Sunday July 31, due to an "ongoing police incident" "We are closed from the Main Gate please do not attend, no access to be granted. "To note also, our staff are also unable to attend work today therefore our phones will not be answered and emails may have a delayed response, we are assisting as needed with the above and will update on reopening when we can." Basildon and Thurrock MP Stephen Metcalfe led tributes to Ms Wright. He tweeted: "My thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Madison Wright. Devastating news - my sincere condolences. Glad @EssexPoliceUK have acted so diligently and charged someone." Bennett, from Pitsea, was not asked to enter a plea during the hearing today.
