Ajax winger Antony has insisted that he is happy at the club - but has refused to rule out a move to Manchester United by the end of the summer transfer window. The Red Devils have been strongly linked with a move for the 22-year-old in recent months, with his former boss Erik ten Hag known to be a big fan. The Brazilian was in superb form as Ajax thrashed Groningen 6-1 in the Eredivisie on Sunday. He showed some brilliant trickery in the first-half to beat three players at once before firing off a shot. And he later scored with a signature left-footed strike from the right flank. United are in desperate need of some quality following their woeful start to the season, and fans are begging for the club to stump up the cash for Antony following his latest display. Speaking after full-time, Antony was asked about the consistent links to Old Trafford by broadcaster NOS. And he replied: “Will Ten Hag call me? No idea.. he has to discuss this with my agents, I’m focused on here. What will come will come, we will see. “I feel good at Ajax. I give everything for this club, every minute... so I am loving this city and this club”. Ajax are thought to value Antony at around £67m, and at the moment it is not thought that United have offered anywhere near that sort of money.
