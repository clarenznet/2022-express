Steve Cooper has completely reshaped his Nottingham Forest team that earned promotion to the Premier League earlier this year, and his side are eying up their 13th signing of the window. The club are interested in Dutch striker Jizz Hornkamp of Willem II.  Forest have already signed one striker this summer, breaking their transfer record to bring in Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin in a deal worth £17.5million. But they lost two strikers early in the summer, and Cooper is keen to provide former Liverpool forward Awoniyi with both cover and potentially a strike partner for what will be a tough campaign for the City Ground outfit. Speaking to BBC Sport ahead of his side’s first game of the season against Newcastle this weekend, Cooper said: “We really believe in our work. There are a number of emotions.

There is focus. We are under no illusions and it will be incredibly tough, game in, game out. Everyone is trying to get as prepared as possible. We have to believe in our work, ourselves. If we don't then why should anyone else? "You have to try to thrive off the challenge. So many players and staff work to try to get an opportunity in the Premier League. We don't want to have negative emotions going into it. We really believe in our work - what we can do - and that we can be more than a good match against any opponent. We will have that approach and other objectives internally."
