Fed up with paying huge bills for broadband? Sky may have the answer with the firm launching new offers that include free internet access for the first six months of the contract. That means those signing up won't pay a penny to browse the web or stream endless entertainment until 2023! These incentives are some of the best Sky TV deals we've seen for a while and allow customers to get television and broadband access for just £26 per month. That's less than BT charges for broadband alone. If that has got you thinking about making the switch to Sky there are a number of plans that feature this free internet access. The cheapest of the bunch is the "Broadband with Sky Q, Sky TV & Netflix" plan which costs just £26 per month for the first six months of the deal. Those joining this package get a Sky Q box which can record numerous shows at once along with pausing live TV and being fully 4K compatible. There's also that Netflix access thrown in along with over 350 other channels - plus there's that free broadband with 59Mbps downloads which should just about cope with the demands of an average home. If it's the new Sky Glass TV that has caught your attention then Sky is also offering this clever television with the same six months free broadband. The fully connected screen, which doesn't require a dish, starts from as little as £13 per month with three sizes to choose from including 44, 55 and 65-inch models.
