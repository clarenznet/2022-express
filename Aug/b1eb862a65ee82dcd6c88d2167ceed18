 Jessica Simpson, 42, put her svelte figure on display as she flaunted her seven stone weight loss in a new social media post. The singer stripped down to just a bikini, showing off her toned muscles in the sizzling snap shared with her 6.1 million Instagram followers. Jessica paired the brown two-piece from her swimwear line with some matching platform sandals. The Dukes of Hazzard star completed the look with a pair of dark shades and a large white hat. She penned alongside the photo: â€œWithout three kids needing me to hurry, I had the time to accessorise the bikini. It is the little things that make me happy."
