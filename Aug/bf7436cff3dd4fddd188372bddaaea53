 Leading UK charity Mind, explains that anxiety is what individuals feel when they are worried, tense or afraid. Although a natural response, when anxiety or panic impacts an individual's everyday life it can become a problem and professional help may be needed. Clinical psychologist and online educator Dr Julie Smith, who has amassed more than three million followers on TikTok has worked hard to educate individuals more about mental health conditions such as anxiety, as well as providing viewers with tips on how to manage their symptoms, some of which can involve getting chilly.    In a video posted back in 2020, Dr Smith recommended her “top five anxiety hacks with ice”. Within the video the expert is seen doing the things she recommends while a song plays in the background. Her top tips included: Despite sounding somewhat extreme, and not pleasant, there is wider research that suggests that using ice cubes for anxiety and panic attacks does actually work, although more research does need to be done in this area. One 2018 study that focused on harm-reduction for people prone to self-cutting listed ice cubes as an “active distraction,” something that also proves helpful during a panic attack.

Although proving successful for some, clinical psychologist Dr Jenny Taitz shared back in March of this year that individuals who are sensitive to migraines or have heart conditions may need to be cautious about using ice to help anxiety and panic attacks. In addition, using ice is not a long-term solution or miracle cure for anxiety, as Dr Taitz puts it: “People need to go in with the right expectations: This is not a cure-all. This is just a way to recalibrate productively. “The ice method is one small tool that’s part of a larger treatment modality, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy. It is not a treatment on its own.”     Dr Albers echoes this, she added: “For some people, ice cubes just aren’t a powerful enough intervention. They are wired in a way that they need drug therapy to help regulate the neurotransmitters in their body in a stable, routine way.” Individuals who are suffering long-term and struggle to cope with anxiety and panic attacks, should seek help from their GP, who may be able to offer alternative treatments such as therapy. In another video Dr Smith delves into some of the behaviours anxiety makes a person do, in order to help individuals identify if they might have some form of the mental health condition. She shared that using the bathroom more often or always checking where the nearest bathroom is, eating more than usual for comfort or eating less if you lost your appetite completely, cancelling plans at the last minute as you feel anxious or overwhelmed and lastly checking things repeatedly, can all be subtle but common signs of anxiety.     Everyone's experience of anxiety is different so it is difficult to always identify a cause, but Mind explains that there are typically multiple factors involved. These can include: For others anxiety and panic attacks can develop in or due to certain criteria, such as when pregnant or just after giving birth and anxiety related to physical appearance or health problems.
