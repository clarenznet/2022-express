The Puppy Love singer posted a clip of his musician son performing on the keyboard and his legion of fans could not help but address the pair's likeness. Taking to the micro-blogging site on July 15, in view of his 207,000 followers, Donny penned: "My son, Chris, is opening up for Collin Raye at a free concert in Salt Lake City this weekend at an event called Draper Days. He wants me and his father-in-law, Derek Roberts, to get up on stage and sing a couple songs with him. This is going to be fun!" Fans flocked to comment on the post, as Twitter user, @danasmi tweeted: "When I watch Chris and listen to his voice, I canâ€™t help but see a younger Donny Osmond in him. He is totally a chip off the old block." @Lesley Charles wrote: "Looks like he is taking after his daddy." @DebbieTuin commented: "Chris is so like you Donny, in voice and looks, so special for you both to be on stage together." Chris has three older brothers Donald Clark Osmond Jr, Jeremy James Osmond, Brandon Michael Osmond and younger brother is Joshua Davis Osmond.
