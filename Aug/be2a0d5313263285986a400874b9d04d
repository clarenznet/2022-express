Speaking to New York magazine, the Cut, Meghan claimed that "there are little girls that I meet and they’re just like, ‘Oh my God, it’s a real-life princess.’” However, the Duchess has come under fire for the comments, with GB News' Colin Brazier suggesting that royal status is not "awarded", it is "earned". In a tweet, Mr Brazier said: "Princess Anne is a 'real life princess'. In that she turns out to hundreds of mundane, low-profile events every year. Royal status is not awarded - it is earned. Meghan's idea of being a 'real life princess' is a corruption of this vision; with no place for duty." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
