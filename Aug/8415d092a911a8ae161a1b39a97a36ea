Rain is forecast to return to the British Isles next week, according to WXCHARTS. The downpours look likely to hit the south of England and Wales, including in areas impacted by recent hosepipe bans. Restrictions were introduced by Southern Water in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight last Friday. Residents in Kent and Sussex will also face a hosepipe ban from August 12 and Pembrokeshire and parts of Carmarthenshire will also endure restrictions from August 19. However, the return of rain is forecast to come on August 16 when it will stretch from Middlesbrough to Medway. Parts of Wales will also be hit by rainfall on August 17. According to WXCHARTS, the return of rain is forecast to coincide with a drop in temperatures.
