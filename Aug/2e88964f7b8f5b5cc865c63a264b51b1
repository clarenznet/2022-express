According to the reports, around 50 Fire fighters and 20 pumps have been tackling the blaze at the hospital in Gwango-dong, Icheon-si. So far, 16 people have been injured while there are around 30 people who are also still trapped inside the hospital.  A fire service spokesperson said: “The dialysis hospital is on fire and we are rescuing patients.” The dialysis hospital is on the fourth level of a five-floor building. Footage from the scene shows several fire fighters with extendable platforms which are being used to evacuate patients from the fire. Medical staff can be seen outside with patients in wheelchairs who are being taken to other hospitals. It is reportedly unknown how many people are still trapped inside the building while some have gone up onto the roof of the building as they await rescue.  A news agency Yonhap reported that mobilising 21 fire trucks and 51 personnel, firefighters completely extinguished the fire at 11:29 am local time before sending in rescuers to the fourth floor to see if anyone needed help. It further stated that the fire authorities assume the fire started at a screen golf facility on the building's third floor although a probe is needed to determine exactly where and why the fire started. According to the officials, the building also houses an oriental medical clinic and offices on the second and third floors and restaurants on the first floor.
