Dave Radley, 75, was distraught when the jewellery slipped off his finger back in 1968. It was given to him by his late mother for his 21st birthday, and he spent hours trying to find it. But in an astonishing stroke of luck a metal detectorist has now discovered the ring in the field Dave had been picking fruit all those years ago. His family had lived in Seagrave, Leics, at the time, where Dave picked strawberries with his friend Mick Lovett to sell to shops. Retired train engineer Dave, of nearby Loughborough, said: "The ring might not have changed but its owner has, so it's a fairly tight fit." "I've had to have it changed as I can just about get it on. But none of that matters because I'm so grateful to have it back. "I took it to the jewellers who valued it at around Â£700, which shows just how much it was worth back in those days." The nine-carat ring was found seven inches under the ground.
