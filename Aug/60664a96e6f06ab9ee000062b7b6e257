Victoria’s Secret model Heidi Klum has been showing off her incredible figure on holiday in St Barts with her husband Tom Kaulitz. The supermodel looked stunning as she posed in a tiny bikini, throwing her hands behind her head and leaning backwards in a video posted on Instagram. “Monday,” Heidi captioned the video, alongside emojis of a moon face, a tropical island, a sunglasses-wearing smiley face, and a love heart. The post has already racked up more than 88k likes on the photo-sharing platform. Heidi has also posted several other racy snaps recently, including some topless photos as she enjoys her “hot girl summer”.
