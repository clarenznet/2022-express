Fortnite will be taken offline for server maintenance today, as Epic Games releases update 21.40 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and Switch. Fortnite update 21.40 has been given an August 16 release date and a 9am BST launch time. If you're wondering how long Fortnite will be offline for server maintenance, check out the details below for the full update 21.40 downtime schedule. According to Epic Games on Twitter, Fortnite matchmaking will be disabled at 8.30am BST in the UK. If you're already in a match before 8.30am, you can continue to play until servers go offline in full at 9am BST UK time. At 9am BST (4am ET), all players will be kicked out of Fortnite until downtime comes to an end. In the meantime, you'll be able to download and install the new update. The news was announced by Epic Games on Twitter: "Yo! Let's Go! Update v21.40 is set to release on August 16th! Downtime starts at 04:00 ET (08:00 UTC), with matchmaking being disabled 30 minutes prior." While there's no official server downtime schedule, Fortnite maintenance typically lasts for a couple of hours. This means you should be able to jump back in at around 11am BST. As for the new content, update 21.40 will be dominated by the Dragon Ball event. New Dragon Ball skins include Goku, Vegeta and Beerus. The outfits will be joined by other cosmetics, such as gliders, backbling and more. The new skins will also be accompanied by seven weeks of challenges, free rewards and a host of in-game items and points of interest. Judging by a leaked trailer, fans can expect the Capsule Corner to join the map, not to mention a communal cinema where Dragon Ball clips will be shown. Players will also be able to cruise the map in the Flying Nimbus and the Saiyan Pod, and communicate with friends using the Fusion Dance emote.
