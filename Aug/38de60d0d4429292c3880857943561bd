The A358 remains closed inÂ Combe Florey, Somerset, because the road is covered in mud following a heavy downpour. Crews have been working tirelessly to clear the road since shutting it in both directions on Monday evening. Photos published by Somerset Live show large amounts of mud on the road. An update from traffic monitoring service INRIX reads: "The A358 is closed in both directions due to a mudslide from Watts Lane to Combe Florey. Traffic is coping well." Travel Somerset tweeted: "Crews are on site now, we hope to have the road cleared as soon as possible. Please plan ahead this morning and avoid this route." Diversions are in place, and take motorists onto rural roads through Willett, Elworthy and other small villages and hamlets. A spokesman for Somerset County Council said: "Crews were on site after a mudslide on the A358 near Combe Florey last night. Following an inspection a decision was taken to close the road overnight as it was not safe to attempt a clear-up operation until daylight hours. Our team is on site now and we hope to reopen the road by the early afternoon." Rain finally fell in the southwest of England on Monday after sweltering 30C temperatures of late. But now Somerset is subject to two yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms expected today and tomorrow. "While some places stay dry, others are likely to see thunderstorms with torrential rain bringing some disruption," the Met Office says on its website. "Flooding of homes and businesses could happen quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong wind. Fast-flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life. "Where flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train and bus services."
