Several Premier League clubs' hopes of signing Ismaila Sarr have been given a huge boost after the Watford winger's proposed transfer to Aston Villa reportedly 'collapsed'. Steven Gerrard had apparently personally called Sarr in a bid to get a £25million deal over the line, but it has now fallen through. Newcastle were another club strongly interested in the Senegal international. The Magpies could now reprise their interest after Villa’s negotiations broke down. That is according to the Daily Telegraph, who claim that a deal for Sarr to go to Villa has fallen through. The news could give Newcastle hope of securing a transfer for the 24-year-old.

Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin were excellent against the reigning Premier League champions. Howe has said that several conditions must be met for new signings to arrive. He told journalists before Newcastle’s meeting with City: "It depends on the competition, we're looking at everything. If there's a player that we can attract that we can afford and all the other things that you need to fall into place, I want to sign the best player I can. "But it needs to fit. Everything, those are the conditions that we've got and are proving quite difficult."
