After years of turmoil at the club, fans hoped the Dutchman could stop the team’s downward spiral and start improving performances. But United lost their first two matches in the Premier League, suffering a 2-1 loss to Brighton at home followed by a 4-0 drubbing away at Brentford. The defeats brought back an all-too painful experience for United fans, with the players struggling to grind out results and sinking to the bottom of the table. However, the Red Devils looked like a revitalised team in their 2-1 win over Liverpool, showing a glimmer of hope for what the future could bring. Before the match against United’s Merseyside rivals, Ten Hag shared how unhappy he was with his team’s displays in the opening two games. He said: “I made myself clear, I was definitely not happy. In football you can talk about a plan and philosophy, but the basic stuff has to be good and that starts with the right attitude.” Whatever he told his players seemed to have worked, with goals from Sancho and Rashford securing the three points and giving United their first victory of the season.
