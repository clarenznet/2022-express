The stunning image, captured by Tiina Tormanen, is one of a collection of highly commended pictures unveiled by the Natural History Museum from entries in this year’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year contest.  Also on the list is seven-year-old Joshua Cox’s portrait of a red deer stag in a snowstorm in London’s Richmond Park. Joshua and his father followed some deer at a safe distance when suddenly one of the stags stopped and stared at them. “He almost looked as if he was having a snow shower,” Joshua said.  A giraffe disappearing between concrete pillars in Nairobi, Kenya, highlighting the contrast between the natural world and human infrastructure, is also on the list, along with a polar bear leaning out of a window in a disused village on an abandoned Soviet weather station and a very relaxed-looking pool party of treefrogs. The winners will be announced at a ceremony hosted by TV presenter Chris Packham, on October 11.
