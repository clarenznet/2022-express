Russell Causley, now in his late 70s, killed his wife Carole Packman in 1985 and got life. He was freed in 2020 but was returned to jail in November after breaching his licence conditions.  The Parole Board first confirmed his latest parole hearings with the Bournemouth Daily Echo in June after the family had sought them for weeks. An MoJ spokesman said: "We are deeply sorry for the distress."
