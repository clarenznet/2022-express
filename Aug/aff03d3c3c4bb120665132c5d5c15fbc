There are delays up to 40 minutes on the southbound stretch of the M1 after a collision. National Highways said the event is expected to clear between 12.30pm and 12.45pm. National Highways: East said on Twitter: “Traffic has been stopped M1 southbound between J11A and J11 (Dunstable) following a collision. “Bedfordshire Police and Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service are on scene.” At 11.25am, National Highways added: “Collision cleared to the hard shoulder and traffic released M1 southbound between J11A and J11 (Dunstable). “There is approx. 4 miles of congestion, please add an extra 40 minutes on to your current journey time.” It comes a day after the M1 was partially closed southbound in Hertfordshire after a car burst into flames. The vehicle on fire, located at J9 A5183 on Dunstable Road near Redbourn, sparked chaos around Luton. Lane one of two was closed on the entry slip road. Traffic monitoring system Inrix said: "M1 Southbound entry slip road partially blocked, queueing traffic due to vehicle fire and people slowing to look at accident on the opposite side at J9 A5183 Dunstable Road (Redbourn). Congestion to J10 for Southbound traffic." Bedfordshire Police also said on Sunday that road closures were expected around Bury Park in Luton. They said: “We are expecting road closures to be put in place in the Bury Park area of Luton today due to a procession. “The event is expected to take place between 12pm and 5pm. If you are travelling you may wish to seek alternative routes and avoid the area.”
