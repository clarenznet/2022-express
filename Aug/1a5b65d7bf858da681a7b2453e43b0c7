Buying a new Apple device is always a big investment but the US firm is currently easing the pain. Customers wanting to pop an iPhone, iPad or MacBook in their shopping basket can spread the cost over two years and not be charged a penny in interest. That means there's the option to pick up the new MacBook Air for just £53 per month, take delivery of an iPad for £13.29 or grab the latest iPhone 13 for just £28 per month. This zero-percent deal has been available for a few weeks but Apple has confirmed that it will end on August 11. If you fancy taking Apple up on the offer of spreading the cost of a new device without paying any interest then all you have to do is pick your product, then choose to pay in instalments with a quick credit check then confirming if you are eligible. Apple has partnered with Barclays to offer this finance deal and it will certainly help ease the pain of buying an expensive new gadget.
