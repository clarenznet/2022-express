Manchester United will face Real Sociedad and one-time Real Madrid conquerors Sheriff in this season's Europa League group stages following the conclusion of Friday's draw. The Red Devils won the competition back in 2017 but will need to overcome a potentially difficult group in order to reach the knockout rounds, although Erik ten Hag will undoubtedly be fancying his team's chances of success. United were the last English side to win the Europa League under the guidance of Jose Mourinho and will be looking to repeat their heroics of yesteryear by lifting the iconic trophy at the end of the campaign. However, there could be a few banana skins to overcome for the Red Devils, who were beaten in the final by Villarreal two seasons ago and have not won any major honours since their last triumph in the competition back in 2017. Arsenal, meanwhile, may have a slightly easier task in getting out of Group A after the Gunners were drawn alongside PSV Eindhoven, Bodo/Glimt and FC Zurich. Mikel Arteta will be desperate to lead the north Londoners into the knockout stages as they look to stamp their authority on the European stage after being forced to sit out last season.
