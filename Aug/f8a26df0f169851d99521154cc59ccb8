  Demi, 59, could be seen spilling out of white triangle-cut bikini, which high-lighted her enviable curves and toned legs. The actress looked stylish in a pair of large glasses and wore her long hair in natural beach waves.

The gorgeous background behind the vacation pics revealed the star and her pet were situated amid peaceful, rolling hills with plenty of greenery.
