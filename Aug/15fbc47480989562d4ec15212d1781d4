Britons could see energy bills soar to £6,000 a year for the first time ever according to expert forecasts, leaving many wondering how they will pay bills. The cost of living crisis is continuing to mount, with consultancy Auxilione predicting the price cap on bills will rise by more than £4,000 over the next eight months. Research shows by October the cap is forecast to hit £3,576, before increasing to £4,799 in January and then soaring to £6,089 in April. Millions of families are predicted to face energy poverty this winter if no new packages of support are introduced, with campaigners urging the Government to act now to alleviate the strain. However, Parliament is currently in recess and isn't due to resume until September 5, 2022. The Labour Party is urging the Government to end its summer break early and return to the Commons to tackle the increasing energy bills. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour's shadow leader of the House of Commons said: "Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills, causing endless worry for households and businesses. "Families deserve a government that is on their side, and is ready to take the action needed now to meet the scale of this national emergency." Boris Johnson is currently on his second holiday of the year, while Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are focusing on campaigning to become the next Prime Minister.
