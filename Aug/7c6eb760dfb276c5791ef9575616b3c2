God I've missed boats,” she wrote. “So our little gang went out on the water with Captain Jason @jasonvale @robrinder @sarahwillingham @jules__sampson and moi. “Missus here is covering up against the sun at the mo. So hot here. But beautiful. Loving it. Happy days.” Speaking about getting ready for a day of sun, Carol also wrote: “Brought a few rash vests and pants all SPF 50+ from @solbari.... Love them.”
