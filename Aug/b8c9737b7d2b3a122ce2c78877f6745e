All eyes will be on Manchester United's game away to Brentford later this evening to see if Erik ten Hag can turn things around from their disappointing defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford last week. But plenty more action is taking place in the Premier League before that, starting with Aston Villa against Everton. Old rivals Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard will stand in opposite dugouts for the first time as opposing managers. Both will be looking to grab a win to help kickstart their season after Villa lost to Bournemouth while Everton ran Chelsea close. Attention will swiftly turn to the 3pm games after that with both Manchester City and Arsenal in action against Bournemouth and Leicester respectively. But there could equally be plenty of goals in games at the Amex, St Mary's and Molineux. Brentford will then host United in the evening kick-off at 5.30pm with Christian Eriksen returning to the side who gave him a chance last season. Ten Hag will need to find a way to lift his side after their demoralising defeat last week to Brighton with Cristiano Ronaldo tipped to start. Express Sport has live updates throughout the day.
