Brenden Aaronson has taunted Chelsea by claiming you could see who "wanted it more" in Leeds' 3-0 demolition of the Blues. Jesse Marsch's side continued their impressive start to the season with a breathtaking display to blow away the Premier League title hopefuls, who finished the game with 10 men after Kalidou Koulibaly's second yellow card. The USMNT attacker set the tone when he pressed Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy before tackling the Senegal international and tapping the ball into an empty net. It was soon 2-0 when Rodrigo got on the end of Jack Harrison's excellent in-swinging dead-ball delivery to head home. The relentless Harrison then added gloss to the scoreline with a third goal in the second half after finishing from close range. It's understood in the latter stages of the game, Leeds had run a staggering 11km more than the visitors on a day of reflection for Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel.
