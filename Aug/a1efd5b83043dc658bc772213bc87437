Energy company BP made the announcement today, revealing its biggest quarterly success for 14 years. Energy prices in the UK are soaring right now, and consultancy firm Cornwall Insight has forecasted that typical bills could rise to £3,600 per year by winter. BP’s latest profits announcement has led to calls for intervention from the Government to help people who are struggling with rising prices. A BP statement described an “exceptional oil trading performance” as one of the key reasons for its success. While the news has been welcomed by BP shareholders, many British families are living in fear of how they will afford to keep their homes warm after summer. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, said: “People are worried sick about energy prices rising again in the autumn, but yet again we see eye-watering profits for oil and gas producers.” Added pressure from rising inflation, which could hit 11 percent before the end of the year, has created a cost of living crisis not experienced for generations. So, is it fair that BP makes billions during an energy crisis? HAVE YOUR SAY RIGHT NOW - JOIN THE EXPRESS READER DEBATE IN OUR COMMENTS SECTION.
