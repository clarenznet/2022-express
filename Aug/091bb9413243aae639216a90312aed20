Storms broke the latest heatwave with a bang yesterday, causing the mercury to plummet from 30C on Monday to just 22C today. The explosive forecast will see people living in England, Wales, and parts of Scotland experience further rain over the next few days. The Met Office has warned some Britons to expect widespread flooding caused by torrential downpours to cause trouble. Weather forecasts show rainfall will spread unevenly across the UK this morning, primarily over the south coast. Maps from WXCharts detected showers depositing light rain of 0.2mm to 2mm per hour off the coast of Cornwall, Dorset, Southampton, the Isle of Wight, and South Wales around 9am. Those showers will cluster around other parts of southern England from 12pm, with similarly light rain around London, Cardiff, the coast of Norwich and the Yorkshire Dales.
