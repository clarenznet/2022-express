Sophie Wessex, 57, looked incredible on Wednesday afternoon as she stepped out wearing a black blouse at the Commonwealth Games. The Countess of Wessex wore a £139.42 ruffle-detail blouse from Me + Em for the occasion. The description on the website says: "Often, ME+EM’s penchant for romance is subtle, but with this blouse we see it sit front and centre in the form of a fanciful ruffled button placket and charming shirred cuffs. "That doesn’t mean, though, that it’s only suited to your formal rotation – slip it on with slim jeans and sneakers and see for yourself." Unfortunately the product is now out of stock.  Sophie paired the black blouse with beige trousers which appeared to be designed by Slowear.
