Madonna, 63, took to Instagram to show her 18.4 million Instagram followers a closer look at her look for her recent Jimmy Fallon's The Tonight Show. She looked great in a black corset, partnered with a black top, lace sleeves and oversized blue joggers. The singer appeared on the show, promoting her new compilation album, while also showing off her new birthday look. Madonna revealed she actually designed her new grills herself as she explained: "They're my 'birthday grills. It's almost my birthday, so I got myself a pair of grills." Responding to criticism, Madonna said: "I just like the way it looks — it's mouth jewellery — and I have really ugly teeth." (sic) Madonna's Jimmy Fallon appearance was criticised due to the Like a Virgin singer 'whipping' the presenter during a racy game.
