The jury in Ryan Giggs' trial has been discharged after failing to reach a verdict on allegations he assaulted and was using controlling behaviour towards his ex-girlfriend. The former Manchester United footballer denied assaulting former partner Kate Greville and all other charges against him.  He stood trial accused of causing actual bodily harm and using controlling and coercive behaviour towards Greville, 38, over a period of three years between 2017 and 2020. Giggs, 48, was also charged with common assault of his ex-girlfriend's young sister, Emma. The 12-member jury was sent out to deliberate their verdict on Tuesday 23 August before one juror was taken ill.  Judge Hilary Manley then gave a majority direction yesterday and would accept verdicts so long as 10 of the 11 jurors agreed. After deliberating for 22 hours and 59 minutes, the jury of seven women and four men announced they were unable to agree on verdicts for any of the charges against Giggs. Judge Manley had asked if a majority of 10 to one had been agreed on any counts, to which the foreman of the jury answered: "No." When asked further if there was any "realistic prospect" of a verdict being reached with more time, the foreman again answered: "No." It means Giggs now faces the possibility of a retrial as the Crown Prosecution Service deliberate over the public interest. They will decide within the next week whether a retrial will take place, but that won't go ahead until June 2023.
