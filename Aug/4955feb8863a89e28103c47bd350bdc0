Janette Manrara, 38, has returned to Spain with her beau Aljaz Skorjanec, 32, just a month after publishing snaps from a getaway in Ibiza. The pair splashed around in the sea delightedly with each other, then posted a series of six snaps from their swimming session, quizzing Instagram fans on which one was their favourite. The loved-up couple were joined by Sara Davies, Aljaz's former partner on Series 19 of Strictly Come Dancing. The trio are extremely close, with Sara previously telling Lorraine Kelly on her ITV show that Aljaz and Janette "have become part of our family". They were believed to be together at Dragons' Den star Sara's holiday home, and have been enjoying the sea and sand, as well eating delicious tapas meals.
