The Care Quality Commission - the regulator responsible for monitoring care homes - is taking on the role as pressure grows on the NHS. It comes after midwives shared their experiences with the watchdog, which has already told two-fifths of maternity units to improve safety. Victoria Vallance, the CQC’s director of secondary and specialist care, said: “We have an opportunity to step up the pace of change and prevent future tragedies from occurring.” A new “continuity of carer” model has been designed to make births safer and more personalised by allocating mothers with a dedicated midwife throughout pregnancy and labour. But it has been only partly introduced across the NHS and critics have said it has created a two-tier service in which women face dangerous delays because of lack of staff on labour wards. NHS England is pushing hospitals to make this the default model of care by March 2024, despite a warning by Donna Ockenden, who led the inquiry into baby deaths at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. She said in her final report that introduction of the new model should be suspended if services lacked enough staff. The Royal College of Midwives has warned staff shortages are contributing to burnout, particularly after Covid pressures. The NHS has also faced strong criticism over failures in maternity care at a number of trusts. A review of Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust across two decades found 201 babies and nine mothers could have survived with better care. NHS chiefs have allocated £4.5million in funding to support the recruitment scheme, which is part of a wider raft of improvements. It builds on NHS England and NHS Improvement’s international nursing recruitment, which saw 21,000 nurses join the health service between September 2019 and March 2021. Latest NHS data shows that there were 633 fewer midwives working in the NHS in April compared with April last year.
