There are several Premier League teams scrambling to get some late transfer deals over the line with the deadline fast approaching. The likes of Manchester United and Chelsea have been linked with the most players, with reinforcements still needed after the start of the campaign last weekend. United seem to have finally given up hope of signing Frenkie de Jong but are said to be working on as many as four deals, including Adrien Rabiot, who is understood to be close to finalising his move from Juventus. Chelsea, meanwhile, are searching for a new centre-back and a striker and could well yet land long-time United target De Jong if the Dutchman can't reach an agreement with Barcelona. The likes of Arsenal, Newcastle and Leeds are expected to splash the cash on at least one fresh face each despite already bolstering their squad while Liverpool could also yet make a move for someone amid an injury crisis of sorts.
