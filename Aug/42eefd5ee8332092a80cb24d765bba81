Just like their royal parents, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are fashion icons and their outfits often sell out in a flash after they make a public appearance. Prince William and Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, have mastered the art of themed outfits, and they are thought to dress their royal trio in similar clothes to symbolise their cohesion as a family outfit. The colour blue could also be a firm favourite with the Cambridges due to its connotations of regality and power.
