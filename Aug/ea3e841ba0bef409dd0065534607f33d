Ian Byrne laid flowers yesterday among the sea of floral tributes and balloons left for the nine-year-old close to her home in Dovecot, Liverpool. The Labour MP for the West Derby area of the city said: "Everyone's heart goes out to the family." Locals have also expressed their shock at the murder eight days ago of Olivia when a gunman chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee, 35, into her family home. Her mother Cheryl, 46, was shot as she tried to stop the pair getting in. Neither man had any link to the family. Mr Byrne added: "The horrendous and senseless nature of the crime has touched everyone." The Rev Peter Smyth, from the local Church of the Holy Spirit, said people had been attending to pray for Olivia. He added: "Liverpool will never get over this and would never forget this. "But people will get on with their lives and are just trying to get back to normal, whatever normal is in the wake of something as horrific as this. The feeling in the community is still one of devastation, shock and horror."  Dovecot resident Dawn Taylor, 26, said: "It's an absolute tragedy. It's so shocking that she was shot in her own home." The mother of two added: "I've stopped my kids playing outside. It doesn't feel safe." Merseyside Police were stopping vehicles yesterday on the major roads into the city as the manhunt for the killer continued. Sniffer dogs were also used in the hunt for the weapon. Merseyside Police have issued a warning to anyone with information that: "Silence isn't an option." Olivia's death was Liverpool's third fatal shooting within a week. Council worker Ashley Dale, 28, and Sam Rimmer, 22, were gunned down in separate incidents.
