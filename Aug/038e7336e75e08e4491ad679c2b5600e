Donald Burgess, who was in a wheelchair and had one leg, was brandishing a knife at staff when two police officers arrived to disarm and handcuff him. The man, who had dementia, was first incapacitated by an officer using PAVA spray and a baton - before the second used a Taser and took away the knife. Mr Burgess was then taken from the home in St Leonardson-Sea, East Sussex, to hospital for treatment, where he died three weeks later on July 13. On June 28, Sussex Police had referred itself to the police watchdog, the IOPC, over claims of excessive use of force. Gross misconduct notices have since been served to the two police constables involved, who are being investigated for manslaughter. The IOPC said this does not mean disciplinary proceedings or criminal charges will follow. The cause of Mr Burgess's death is not yet established, but witness statements have been taken and the officers' body-worn video footage has been reviewed by investigators. ACC Tanya Jones, of Sussex Police, sent her "sympathies" to Mr Burgess's loved ones. She said: "We are providing every assistance to the IOPC to allow for a thorough investigation and for the family to get the answers they need."
