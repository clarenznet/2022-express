Enchanting yew trees are spread across the land, and some are over 5,000 years old. But artist and yew expert Janis Fry, 72, says the "immortal giants" could disappear because the majority are in churchyards, which are increasingly being sold off to developers. Speaking after visiting a 5,000-year-old yew at Defynnog, in the Brecon Beacons National Park, she said: "This is the tree of life, terribly important for us as a symbol for our future. It's an ancient tree. It's always been here. "The church owns most of these ancient trees. We, in Britain, have the largest collection of ancient yews on Earth. We're talking about the longest living trees on the planet." The UK has 157 of the variety over 2,000 years old. And at least 500 churchyards in England have trees older than the buildings themselves, says the Woodland Trust. Naomi Tilley, the charity's lead campaigner, said: "As a society we protect what we value, and we value what we protect."  Calling for better legal safeguards, she added: "Well-established measures keep our most important wildlife, oldest buildings and other national treasures safe, rightly so. But some rare fungi relying on ancient trees is better protected than the trees." Fellow activist Janis, from west Wales, launched a petition to save yews, which has hit 308,000 signatures. She said: "There is no legal protection for these beautiful trees. It's urgent that we protect this vital part of our heritage with specific legal measures before we lose any more."  Janis added: "Currently, the only recourse is to go through the long, difficult process of a Tree Protection Order. This would mean if the trees were destroyed by a developer, they would have to pay only a small fine." To sign the petition, go to this link.
