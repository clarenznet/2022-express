After months of headaches, Kane Allcock, 15, was admitted to A&E last April. Neuro tests failed to detect any problems and he was sent home with painkillers.  But the teen, who plays for Crewe Alexandra’s youth team, suffered a seizure and an MRI scan found a large non-cancerous tumour. He underwent a 7.5-hour op and is recovering. Now his family, of Crewe, are raising money for Alder Hey Children’s Charity.
