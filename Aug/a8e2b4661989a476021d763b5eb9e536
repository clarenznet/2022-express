With many left to choose between heating and eating, they are simply unable to pay a Â£159 annual charge, warns Silver Voices. Last Monday marked the second anniversary of the re-introduction of the licence fee for 4.5 million over-75s, who had not had to pay since November 2000.  Dennis Reed, director of the campaign group, said: "The more inflation rises and the more older people are plunged into poverty, they will find fewer people paying. "People are now writing to me saying they can't afford to pay. "We expect the BBC to be sympathetic in those situations. "They ought to be doing something more to recognise the cost-of-living crisis but they don't seem to be doing anything at all." The BBC was approached for comment.
