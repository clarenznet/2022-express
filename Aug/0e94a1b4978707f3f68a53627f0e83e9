Exeter, Birmingham, Sunderland, Swansea, Glasgow and Belfast are among the first to receive grants of up to £70,000. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: "Working with responsible gum manufacturers, we are now giving councils extra help to clean up our cities and towns."  The clean-up cost of chewing gum for councils is around £7million a year. The Keep Britain Tidy campaign estimates around 87 percent of England's streets are stained with gum.
