There is not long left to go now before the summer transfer window slams shut, and up and down the country Premier League clubs will be desperately trying to add that extra bit of quality that could make all the difference to their season. Manchester United have so far only managed to sign Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen to their ranks, but they are thought to be closing in on a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot, and are also being linked with a whole host of other names. There are also plenty of rumours over outgoings, with suggestions that Marcus Rashford could be on his way out of Old Trafford after Paris Saint-Germain reportedly expressed an interest in the England international. Whether or not they get a deal done in the coming weeks remains to be seen. Elsewhere, Chelsea have been splashing the cash recently on the likes of Raheem Sterling and Marc Cucurella, and they may not be willing to stop there. Leicester defender Wesley Fofana is being touted as an option, and the Blues could intensify their interest in the near future. And with the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Newcastle all unlikely to be finished with their spending just yet, there could still be plenty of twists and turns still to come before September.
