MPs have blasted forecourt bosses for over-charging. Tory Craig Mackinlay, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Fuel, said: "We should be seeing reductions of at least 25p per litre across all pumps - excessive profiteering is at play somewhere or at multiple points in the supply chain."  The wholesale price of unleaded petrol fell by a fifth to 123.81p a litre from June 1 to August 9. The price paid by motorists increased in this period. The profit on sales of unleaded is the largest since at least 2013. Simon Williams, of the RAC, said: "Petrol should come down to 160p per litre."
