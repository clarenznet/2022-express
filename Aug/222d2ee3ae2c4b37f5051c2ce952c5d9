Despite wet and windy conditions, he stuck to the task to finish three shots clear of the field and won many supporters among British golf fans. "I made very few mistakes and nothing bothered me, which was unusual," he said. "I was so confident, everything seemed in slow motion. It was my greatest memory in tournament golf." However, he did have a short fuse and was nicknamed the Towering Inferno because of his angry blow-ups, which sometimes involved hurling his clubs. Born in Massillon, Ohio, USA, his father Thomas and mother Eva were both keen amateur golfers. He earned a golfing scholarship to Ohio State University and, in 1968, won his first professional tournament at San Diego's Torrey Pines course. For a time he battled a drink problem, which seemed to exacerbate his on-course tantrums. At the US Masters in 1980 at Augusta, he lost the plot on the par three 12th hole, hitting his ball into water, known as Rae's Creek, four times. He scored 13 on the hole, wrecking his chances. As his playing career waned, he moved into golf course design. With architect Jay Morrish he created the Loch Lomond course in Scotland in 1993, now one of Britain's best courses. While working on the project he stepped into a bog and spent four hours carefully moving through the sludge so as not to be totally consumed. Keeping a cool head saved his life on that occasion. Weiskopf was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2020 but continued to design courses from his home in Montana. In 1966 he married Jeanne and they had two children, Eric and Heidi, but divorced in 1999. He is survived by his second wife, Laurie.
