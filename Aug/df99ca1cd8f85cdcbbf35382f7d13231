The first episode of Archetypes, which explores female stereotypes, was released today and features tennis star and friend of Meghan, Serena Williams. However, the podcast has received criticism from royal commentator Angela Levin who in a tweet said: "Meghan first podcast is out. She and Serena Williams giggle away with lots of 'oh my gosh'. "Meghan encourages her to complain about how a woman is held back and how they are victims. You couldn't make it up." Adding to Ms Levin's criticism Twitter user @locket321 said: "Every story/anecdote she offers is always based on our Royal Family- she appears to having nothing but that to offer." However, not everyone was critical of the podcast, and many fans of the Duchess took to social media to share their excitement at its release. @shelbbs247 tweeted: "Duchess Meghan Markle’s long-awaited #Archetypes podcast is HERE. I’m so excited; I don't want to talk about anything else!"  FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
