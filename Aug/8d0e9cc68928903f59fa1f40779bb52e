HMS Lancaster from the British armed forces is shadowing Russian tanker Vjazma, cruiser Marshal Ustinov and destroyer Vice Admiral Ustinov from British shores. The Royal Navy remains on alert as Russia's war in Ukraine continues to rage.  Reitred Dutch journalist Hans de Vreij posted on Twitter: "A Russian naval squadron approaches the Irish Sea. These are the cruiser Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer Vice Admiral Ustinov, an unnamed submarine and the tanker Vjazma. "Only the latter is 'visible' on tracking sites such as MarineTraffic." Author H I Sutton, who writes Independent Defense Analysis, said on Tuesday Ustinov had left the Mediterranean on August 24 to slowly approach the UK. He said the Russian warships were understood to be returning home after more than six months deployed to the Mediterranean to support Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. These are just the latest Russian Navy vessels to pass close to our shores under the watchful eye of the UK’s Armed Forces. It comes less than 24 hours after a Royal Navy warship shadowed a group of Russian Navy ships after they were spotted making an "unusual transit" through the Irish Sea.

The multi-million pound deal is reportedly on the verge of being struck with the Ministry of Defence, which would see BAE build five brand new Type 26 frigates. Type 26 frigates are built for the Royal Navy and are described as a world-class warfare ship used to conduct advanced anti-submarine warfare missions while supporting air defence and general purpose operations. A contract for the five ships is expected to be completed within the next few years.
