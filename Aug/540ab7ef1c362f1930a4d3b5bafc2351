Writing on Twitter, Royal author Phil Dampier said he "can't see any chance of a reconciliation between the Sussexes and the Cambridges until Harry's book is out of the way." He added: "It's likely to make things worse!" The Duke of Sussex is expected to release his tell-all memoir later this year. According to publisher Penguin, Harry's memoir will "share, for the very first time, the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses and life lessons that have helped shape him". The Duke said he is keen to share the first "accurate and wholly truthful" account of his own life. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
