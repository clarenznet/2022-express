The 9ft bronze sculpture was revealed close to Lancashire's Lytham seafront, witnessed by hundreds of adoring guests. For almost the entire 1980s Bobby was a Saturday night TV favourite with double act partner Tommy Cannon. His catchphrases included "Rock on, Tommy" and "That'll do for me, cocker". The 5ft 3ins funnyman died aged 76 in October, 2020. Celebrities Les Dennis and Lee Mack - who starred with Bobby in BBC sitcom hit Not Going Out - joined Tommy to pay tribute at the ceremony in his adopted hometown. And Bobby's widow, Yvonne, declared with a smile: "To put it in his words, he'd be 'piggin' chuffed'." The Â£100,000 statue, by sculptor Ben Twiston-Davies, was paid for by crowdfunding.
