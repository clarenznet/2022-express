 Mel C, 48, and Geri Horner, 49, enjoyed a Spice Girls reunion at the UEFA Women’s Euro final at Wembley in London on Sunday. The pair dressed up in football attire as they had a blast watching the lionesses beat Germany. Mel couldn’t be missed in a bright orange England shirt teamed with blue trousers. Meanwhile, Geri opted for all-white in a tribute to the England colours. Taking to Instagram, Melanie flashed a peace sign to the camera as she posed with Geri. In the caption, the Liverpool native wrote: “At the final! @lionesses!”
