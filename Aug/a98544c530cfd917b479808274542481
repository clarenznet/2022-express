Environment Secretary George Eustice said he was the first Secretary of State to “really grip” the issue after ministers said water companies would be expected to invest £56billion over 25 years to combat the impact of storm overflows on England’s seas and rivers. But the proposals have drawn criticism from conservation campaigners, who say the plan aims only to “claw its way back to what should have been ‘business as usual’”. Tim Farron, Lib Dem environment spokesperson, even branded them a “cruel joke”. The Government has announced new targets, including improving all overflows releasing into, or near, every designated bathing water, and 75 per cent of those discharging to priority sites, by 2035. By 2050, no storm overflows will be allowed outside of unusually heavy rainfall or to cause any ecological harm.
