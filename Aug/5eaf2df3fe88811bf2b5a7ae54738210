Festival-goers arriving at Reading yesterday could be forgiven for thinking Mud were headlining the bank holiday extravaganza in Berkshire, as they trudged through a quagmire to pitch tents. Elsewhere, waterlogged public buildings closed, roads were submerged, rail services disrupted, and power cuts hit hundreds of homes. Forecasters issued nine flood alerts and a yellow thunderstorm warning and the Environment Agency (EA) warned some rivers could burst their banks. Parts of the South-east and East Anglia were zapped by around 5,000 lightning strikes between midnight and 8am. Four London Tube stations were waterlogged and an elderly couple in Horsham, West Sussex, were rescued when their car was stranded in an underpass. In Derby, 900 homes were left without electricity and 800 properties in Cambridgeshire were blacked out. Milton Keynes, Bucks, had 300 powerless homes, with 200 in the Peterborough and Northampton area.
