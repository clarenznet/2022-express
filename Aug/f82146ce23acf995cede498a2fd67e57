The busy London Underground station in Central London was cleared of all commuters following a fire alert. Video footage shared on Twitter shows passengers leaving a train via the platform and handed bottles of water by station employees as temperatures soared below ground. Firefighters can also be seen on the platform, checking that the carriages are empty.   A London Fire Brigade spokesperson told Express.co.uk: "Firefighters were called to reports of smoke on the Jubilee Line at Bond Street Station this morning. "Crews investigated and found the smoke had been caused by faulty brakes on a southbound train carriage. "The train was removed and the station was evacuated. It has now reopened. There were no reports of any injuries. "The Brigade was called at 1156 and the incident was over for firefighters by 1244. Three fire engines from Paddington and Soho fire stations were at the scene."
