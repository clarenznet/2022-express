Noel Gallagher, 55, looked shocked after he was serenaded by fans with his own song in a restaurant in Ibiza. The Oasis star was stunned after passers-by and punters sang the lyrics of Wonderwall to him. The singer-songwriter was sitting alongside his wife Sara MacDonald and their son at the restaurant. A local filmed the incident and took to TikTok to share it. @Melisse2211 said in the TikTok post: "Noel Gallagher from Oasis in Ibiza!!! Everyone was singing their song. "I think he was a little embarrassed hehe." Nevertheless, it appeared as if the family revelled in the moment, as they went on to share a chuckle and continue their evening.
