Anthony Smith had his automatic release put on hold under new powers to protect the public. Tony, now seven, was so badly abused at the hands of his father and mother Jody Simpson that he needed to have both legs amputated. He was 41 days old when he was assaulted, an attack that caused multiple fractures, dislocations and blunt trauma to the face, leading to organ failure, toxic shock and sepsis. The pair were convicted of causing or allowing serious physical harm to a child and child cruelty. Smith, 50, had been due for release in early September at the halfway point of his sentence after both were jailed for 10 years. His case was referred to the Parole Board by Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, overriding the automatic conditional release of a prisoner. Tony’s adoptive mother, Paula Hudgell, said: “Once again we are extremely grateful that Dominic Raab has stepped in on Anthony Smith’s release. It shows the importance of why Tony’s Law needed to come into force as sentences absolutely were too lenient. “It also still highlights the absolute need for a child cruelty register.” Earlier this month, Simpson’s release on licence was also put on hold and a decision on whether to release either or both will be made by the Parole Board in due course, the Ministry of Justice said. Mr Raab said: “I’ve put Smith’s release on hold and will be referring his case to the Parole Board so any risk he might pose is thoroughly checked.” Tougher sentencing for child abusers, known as “Tony’s Law”, came into force in June under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022.
