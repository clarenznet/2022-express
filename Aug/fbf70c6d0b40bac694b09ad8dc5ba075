The hosepipe ban will take place from August 5 in Hampshire and Isle of Wight, and August 12 in Kent and Sussex, after weeks of extreme weather and heatwaves caused havoc around the UK. Any use of a hosepipe or sprinkler during this period in the affected areas is prohibited, as utility firms attempt to limit the use of water. South East Water said demand for water has “has broken all previous records”, and claimed that it is producing an additional 120 million litres of water a day to meet soaring demand. In July, Britain recorded a new record high temperature, when the Met Office confirmed a scorching heat of 40.3°C at Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Despite the ban, some may try to use their hosepipe or sprinkler anyway, ignoring the restrictions. Individuals who are caught may be fined a hefty amount, being made to pay up to £1,000 if they break the rules. People who see their neighbours breaking the rules face a moral dilemma, and have to decide whether to report anyone not adhering to the rules.
