Irish Fianna Fáil politician Thomas Byrne has said leadership candidate Liz Truss should do away with “extreme Euro-scepticism” as the ongoing uncertainty over the Northern Ireland protocol continues. Liz Truss, who introduced the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill to parliament earlier this year, has remained steadfast in her commitment to continue Boris Johnson’s Brexit legacy if she succeeds in becoming the next Prime Minister. But the bill is raising concerns over the Irish Sea, with Ireland’s Europe Minister saying it is “difficult to know” if either Ms Truss or Rishi Sunak would approach the protocol matters differently to Mr Johnson. He said: “We really don’t have a huge amount to go on except that people who’ve expressed I suppose, extreme Euro-scepticism, are backing Liz Truss predominantly. “I would hope that she would be her own person and I think we have reason to believe that she will be her own person. “Everybody who takes that office becomes their own person and realises that they there is a greater weight than just the day-to-day politics of the job.” Mr Byrne added: “In terms of us, the Irish government, there will always be an open door to really good relations with Britain”.
