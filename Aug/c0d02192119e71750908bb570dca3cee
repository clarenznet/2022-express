Warwick University has sounded the alarm about Far From The Madding Crowd - one of the famously pessimistic Victorian writer's most cheerful and popular tales. It has been voted among the best love stories and dramatised several times, most recently in a 2015 film starring Carey Mulligan. But the university warns students the 1874 novel "contains some potentially rather upsetting scenes tting concerning the cruelty of nature and rural life".  That may refer to a early episode when a flock of sheep is driven over a cliff by a rogue sheepdog - who is then shot. The decision to warn students was criticised by Kent university professor Frank Furedi, who said: "Literature was not invented to be a kind of 21st century therapy. Hardy can be tragic but it is moving and beautiful. "If we approach literature in a spirit of discovery, then we will get something out of it. "But putting a trigger warning on a book by Hardy, you are treating it as a health risk rather than a novel." The caution is the latest of a number issued by universities to brace students for emotionally harrowing material in classics like Shakespeare and Dickens.  A week ago Aberdeen university warned its students about animal cruelty in the 1,000-yearold fantasy poem Boewulf - which is about a hero who kills a series of monsters. Last night Warwick University explained that a few departments and academics issued "content guidance notices" for course material. It added: "We fully respect our colleagues' right to exercise their academic freedom in this way. "But the practice remains rare within the university, with less than one per cent of our overall curriculum including any content guidance."
