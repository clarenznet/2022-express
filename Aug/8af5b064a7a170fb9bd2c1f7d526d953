Michael Parr, who is best known for his role as Ross Barton in Emmerdale, has stunned fans with his unbelievable fitness transformation. Mike, who recently celebrated his 36th birthday, shared a before and after snap as he showcased his new ripped physique. Revealing how he did it, Mike says he “quit the gym” and now feels “stronger than ever”. He wrote: “36 today. And what a year it was. From hurting my back in November, the day before I was supposed to move house and two days before I was set to fly to Morocco for a job. “You can see in the second pic that I was in pretty bad shape. My hips were all off line. Sciatic nerve was trapped and I damaged my C2&C3. I thought it was gonna hurt forever. “I quit the gym and now have just been working out with dumbbells at home and I feel better and stronger than ever. Good diet. Fasting. Cold showers and just everything in moderation.”
