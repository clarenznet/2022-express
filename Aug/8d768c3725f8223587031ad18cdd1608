Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp revealed that he will hold talks with Darwin Nunez after the £85million new boy was sent off on his Anfield debut. Nunez has been criticised by Klopp after inexplicably headbutting Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen. Andersen confronted Nunez for appealing for a foul inside the penalty area and pushed the Uruguayan's arm as he walked away. Nunez responded by turning around and launching his head into the nose of the Palace man. "It’s not the reaction you want to see. Centre-halves in the Premier League do that - they want to have him, he’s a handful himself but that’s a reaction.” “There’s no time, there’s no pre-season. We don’t know how long he will be suspended. We will use it (suspension) for physical work - not as punishment - but making him even stronger and that’s what we’ll try.” Luis Diaz salvaged a point for the 10-man Reds soon after Nunez's 57th-minute red card. Wilfried Zaha had given Palace the lead before half-time.

Liverpool have now drawn both of their opening Premier League games - having struggled to a 2-2 stalemate with Fulham last weekend. Klopp added: “It (two draws) is not what we wanted, but in this moment it’s the least of my problems. We have our own situation, it’s tricky with injuries, we have to use the new week to bring one or two back. “I’m not sure about that. We lost Darwin today which doesn’t help, Bobby might be ready for next week (against Manchester United). It’s not a concern, it’s just the start, if we have two points in May then it’s difficult but for now it’s fine."
