The recent publication by the UK’s House of Commons Defence Committee’s response to the Government's Integrated Defence and Security review, which has a whole annex on the Ajax armoured cavalry vehicle debacle, has thrown me once again into a paroxysm of despair. It does not make for pretty reading. Briefly, after a number of false starts, in 2010 the MoD awarded a £5.5 billion contract to General Dynamics Land Systems UK to provide some 589 variants of the Ajax vehicle to replace the UK’s obsolete reconnaissance armoured and support vehicles. And, despite the expenditure of – so far - £3.2 billion, of the agreed sum the British Army has not taken delivery of any which can be operated safely.Although Ajax is a development of the Austro-Spanish ASCOD tracked vehicle already in service with various armies since the early 2000s, the British development has been beset by major problems.Many of these appear to have been the result of changing requirements by the MoD and the very British habit of seeking to “gold-plate” existing successful designs to incorporate new, immature technological developments.How could the MoD get this so horribly wrong?  I believe there are several reasons.First and most importantly, my own time spent in defence procurement demonstrated to me a sclerotic system firmly rooted in the past.From the 1920s – 1950s (even during the Second World War) Britain’s AFV production effort was effectively a cottage industry.Assorted firms and teams - some competent and innovative, some not - tinkered away on their own pet projects with no real sense of a coordinated, national effort. I suspect aspects of this ethos remain today, not that there’s much of a UK AFV industry left. The MoD efforts seem still to be mired in the timeframe of the days when you built a prototype, tested it, bent some metal to iron out the glitches at repeat the system ad nauseam.No wonder the flash to bang time of UK AFV procurement has tended historically to be in excess of 10 years.This is hopeless, of course, when modern advances in technology can render new equipment obsolete in about six months!This egregious state of affairs is exacerbated by what defence analyst Francis Tusa has labelled “British exceptionalism”, sometimes described less kindly as “not invented here syndrome”.This is an institutionalised resistance in the equipment procurement system to anything that does not originate within the UK or from UK initiatives, which is surprising given that the British armed services are awash with weapons systems sourced from abroad.The “exceptionalism” bit kicks in when, even when accepting another country’s AFV, for example, as being the best fit for the requirement, there is insistence on a multitude of changes to make it “ours”.It also doesn’t help when military officers in the equipment procurement world tend to hold their positions short term, with most being posted elsewhere within an 18 months to two year timeframe to ensure their planned career paths continue.Accordingly they are seldom around to take responsibility for the decisions they make, which can lead to a certain sang froid when dealing with such matters. Add to this the fact that the important decisions are usually taken by senior officers who may not be up to speed with more recent technological developments, leaving them easy prey to persuasion from commercial interests.And – surprise, surprise – many of these self-same officers who have been working on such projects whilst in uniform end up working for the companies they awarded the contracts to when they retire from the Army!This is an entirely separate, but related, topic which I think merits further investigation.At present, there is no prospect of Ajax being accepted into service until problems with vibration and noise which are seriously affecting the health of trial crews are resolved.Westminster’s Public Accounts Committee has now lost patience with the project and has set a deadline of December 2022 for a decision one way or another on the vehicle’s viability. I’m not holding my breath for a positive outcome.My personal view is that we should avoid getting sucked into the sunk costs fallacy, pull the plug on Ajax, and seek something else by buying an existing, successful vehicle like BAE System’s CV 90 off the shelf and resisting all temptation to fiddle with what is a successful and proven design.Lt Col Stuart Crawford, former army officer, author and broadcaster.
