Prices have fallen from around £6,000 with callous smugglers declaring they have "never been cheaper". A National Crime Agency source said: "The costs per migrant for travelling within a heavy goods vehicle are on average estimated to cost between £2,000 to £3,000 more than small boats crossings." The lower cost could reflect that it is high risk but an unsophisticated method of getting to Britain. TikTok videos show competition between rival gangs. Some mock the Government's policy to deport some migrants to Africa, stating "Rwanda has been cancelled". Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: "The Home Office needs to work with the social media giants to take them down and pursue those behind them." Former Border Force boss Tony Smith urged the firms to provide police with "valuable intelligence while shutting down the smugglers' lines of communication". A TikTok spokesman said: "We do not allow content that depicts or promotes people-smuggling... and have permanently banned these accounts." Nearly 400 crossed the Channel by small boat on Monday, bringing the total this month to more than 2,000 so far.
