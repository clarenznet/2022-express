The megastar, 34, who loves to chat but usually keeps a lid on her private life, divulges her feelings for US sports agent Rich Paul in Elle magazine. They have been an official item since September 2021 and Adele said: “I’ve never been in love like this. I’m obsessed with him. I’m just in loooove! I’m happy as I’ll ever be. I might as well be married.” She added: “I definitely want more kids. I’m a homemaker and I’m a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music.” But the Easy on Me singer rubbishes claims that she is engaged to the 40-year-old, whose firm represents US basketball stars like LeBron James. Adele said: “I’m not engaged. I just love high-end jewellery, boy!” The winner of 12 Brit Awards and 15 Grammys talks further about the end of her marriage to Simon Konecki – with whom she shares son Angelo, nine. The painful 2019 split influenced songs on her album 30, released last November. She says Covid lockdowns as she came to terms with the break-up also left her feeling very low.  But Adele is clearly back on an even keel – boosted by her first concerts in five years at Hyde Park. And she is happy to discuss her relationship with Paul, who has three children of his own, as she prepares for her postponed Las Vegas residency shows called Weekends With Adele. She canned the original concerts in an emotional video message just hours before taking to the stage. In a stunning Elle photoshoot to go with the interview, the LA-based British icon looks radiant and mellow in a £5,728 yellow coat by Loro Piana. And she tells the magazine: “All I got in my brain is Vegas. I wanna ******* nail it.” Adele, who used weights and boxing to slim down during the pandemic, also wows in a cover shot wearing a £2,893 cream Celine coat. A third sees her in a £315 Courreges sweater. She kicks off her Caesars Palace season in November and says: “I want to tell the story of my career to now. It’s all about the music. It’s really nostalgic. It’s gonna be really beautiful.”
