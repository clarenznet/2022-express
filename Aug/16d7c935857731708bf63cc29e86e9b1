After a gruelling exam-dominated end to their summer terms, GCSE and A-Level students have had the last few weeks to relax with a long break. For some, anxiety will have started flaring again recently as they expect their results. As exam boards finish their final tallies, authorities have scheduled results days for years 10 and 12. A-Level results will become available first in the UK, with universities anticipating applicants' grades in just over a week. Exams office staff can check prospective students' results on August 17, "restricted release day". They can view the grades by 12.01am, a day before school staff, but cannot distribute them.

According to Prospects.uk, UCAS will post the results on its tracking service by 8am on the day. UCAS Hub will also show whether universities have confirmed or rejected their offers. Students can collect their results in person from their school as UCAS makes them public. Educators can expect grades for VTQ level 2 and below "on or before" August 25. Unlike A-Levels, there is no universal platform for GCSE students to receive their results online, so they must go to school. Most schools should open for results around 8am, but they will decide how students collect results ahead of time. They can arrange alternative collection methods, such as via email, by speaking with school staff. Many GCSE students took exams for the first time in 2022, with the pandemic having scuppered exam organisation since 2020. The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) has arranged an alternative approach to grading. Ofqual intends to reflect a "midway point" between 2019 and 2021 that asks awarding organisations to "take account of the approach for GCSEs" that may result in higher grades than when students sat previous exams.
