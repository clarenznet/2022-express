The heir to the throne took the hot seat at The Voice to help produce a special edition – due out this week – to commemorate the African-Caribbean paper’s 40th anniversary. The Prince’s edit touches on themes including community cohesion, education, climate, the Commonwealth, faith and the arts, a Clarence House statement revealed. And Charles said of his stint at the paper: “Over the last four decades, with all the enormous changes they have witnessed, Britain’s only surviving black newspaper has become an institution and a crucial part of the fabric of our society. “This is why I was so touched to be invited to edit this special edition.” It includes an interview with actor Idris Elba in which the 49-year-old star of BBC crime drama Luther and pioneering US drama The Wire recalls how a Prince’s Trust grant at the age of 16 “opened doors that changed my life”. And the special edition, out on Thursday, also has an interview with Baroness Floella Benjamin about the Windrush Portraits Project. It is an initiative created by Prince Charles of artwork featuring 10 mystery sitters which will be unveiled next summer. Lester Holloway, The Voice’s editor, said of Charles: “Our readers may be surprised at the parallels between the issues which The Voice has campaigned on for four decades and the work the Prince of Wales has been involved in over the same period, often behind the scenes. In past decades these causes were once scorned and ridiculed, but today they are widely acknowledged. “Yet all the research tells us how far we have to go to be a truly equal society. The Prince has an awareness of this and that in itself is a reason to be hopeful.”
