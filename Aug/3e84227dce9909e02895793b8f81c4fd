In one case an all-female party that rented a property called local police after discovering a motion sensor camera had been installed in their bathroom. Police were also called to a case of “making threats” after a landlord was annoyed they had not been given top marks in an online review.  Included in the incidents were allegations of date rapes, drug taking, sexual assaults, theft and even someone who faked their death to avoid payment. The company was connected to almost 400 crime reports logged by police forces in England and Wales last year. However, the online giant believes many incidents were wrongly linked to Airbnb, which it claims has become a generic term for online holiday rentals. The company also said it has brought in measures to reduce incidents. These include a ban on party houses as well as a 24-hour safety line. In another police incident officers from Devon and Cornwall were called after a suspicious neighbour suspected a nearby Airbnb property was being used as a brothel. The caller said a dozen women were staying in the home and a string of older men kept visiting the property.  In Bedfordshire, a converted pub was trashed by a group who left the floors and walls covered in food and vomit. In total £5,000 of damage was caused. And renters of a property in the West Midlands tipped off police that the property contained a cannabis plant, as well as paraphernalia to start a larger drugs operation. Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk. It dominates the online holiday property market. Airbnb said: “We have industry-leading measures and policies in place to prevent and clamp down on bad actors, and have zero tolerance for illegal behaviour. Incidents on Airbnb are rare, and we take action on those brought to our attention, including working with the police. “Airbnb is a term used to describe an entire industry, and no evidence has been provided that this data relates to bookings made through Airbnb.”
