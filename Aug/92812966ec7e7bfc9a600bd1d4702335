Just days after announcing that he intends to return to the ring, Tyson Fury has announced that he has retired once again. On Tuesday, 'The Gypsy King' took to social media to confirm that he will be fighting Derek Chisora later this year but has since backtracked on his statement. Posting to Instagram, he wrote: "MASSIVE THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO HAD AN INPUT IN MY CAREER OVER THE YEARS & AFTER LONG HARD CONVERSATIONS IV FINALY DECIDED TO WALK AWAY & ON MY 34th BIRTHDAY I SAY Bon voyage.

Fury had originally retired in April after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium but came out a few days ago to tell fans that he was unretiring to face Chisora in a third fight under novice coach and former Commonwealth featherweight champion Isaac Lowe.  In a video uploaded to Twitter, he said: "Well Andy, I've decided to come back to boxing because I can be the first heavyweight champion in history to have two trilogies, one with Deontay Wilder and a second one with Derek Chisora. "I always said I'd fight Derek Chisora at the end of my career and here we are breaking all records again, setting precedents and why I've chosen Isaac Lowe as my trainer is because when I was with Peter [Fury] Issac was there, when I was with Ben [Davison] Issac's always been there, and when I was with SugarHill [Steward] Isaac's always been there as well. He's always given me information, he knows me better than anybody on the planet and we're a great team, we've always been together and we're going to finish this out together. "We've always worked very well together, and here we are about to take on a massive massive massive event." MORE BOXING NEWS...
