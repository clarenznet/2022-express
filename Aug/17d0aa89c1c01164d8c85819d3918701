Manchester United registered a long-awaited victory over Liverpool after surviving a late scare to claim all three points at the expense of their bitter rivals at Old Trafford. The Red Devils had Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford to thank for sealing victory with two exquisite goals that stunned the visitors, who are still winless in the Premier League after their first three matches of the new campaign. United took control of the match from the first whistle and went ahead early on through Sancho, who used his trickery to skip into space before placing the ball past Alisson Becker and into the back of the net with ease. The Reds went on to gain a foothold in the contest as the interval approached but were unable to equalise before the break in spite of their best efforts. Liverpool's lack of end product came back to haunt them in the second half when Rashford doubled United's lead with a cool finish from the edge of the area. Their advantage was put under threat when Mohamed Salah headed home for Liverpool during the closing stages of the match, but Erik ten Hag's side managed to cling on for their first victory of the season in front of a capacity crowd on home soil.
