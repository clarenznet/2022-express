Beyonce, 40, will re-record her track Heated and remove an offensive lyric which has been described as an ableist slur. The song, which features on Beyonce’s new album Renaissance, included a disparaging term to describe the condition spastic cerebral palsy. The derogatory word, which can have different connotations in the US, is used twice towards the end of the track which was co-written by Beyonce and Drake.Following the song’s release on Friday, it sparked anger among disability campaigners and charity Scope asked Beyonce to re-record the song and remove the term.The charity’s media manager, Warren Kirwan, said in a statement: “Words matter because they reinforce the negative attitudes disabled people face every day."Beyonce has long been a champion of inclusivity and equality, so we would urge her to remove this offensive lyric."

Scope's Mr Kirwan has since responded in a follow-up statement in which he said “it's good” that the Grammy winner “acted so swiftly” after disabled people had to call out the derogatory term “yet again”.He added: "There's a feeling of deja vu as it's just a few weeks since Lizzo also had to re-release a song after featuring the same offensive language."We hope this is the last time we see this kind of thing from anyone, let alone musicians with massive global influence.”Last month, Lizzo suffered similar criticism after the slur was included in her track Grrrls.
