The closure of the summer transfer window is less than a week away. Manchester United and Chelsea are the busiest Premier League clubs but Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham may yet make one final signing each before the 11pm deadline next Thursday. Chelsea are set to clinch the signing of Wesley Fofana from Leicester but also want Barcelona's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Everton winger Anthony Gordon. The Blues may end the summer having spent more than £300million. Manchester United want to add a new winger having had a £76million bid for Antony from Ajax rejected. Cody Gakpo of PSV is another player in their crosshairs, as is Barcelona's Memphis Depay who previously played at Old Trafford earlier in his career. Arsenal are tracking Wolves wide-man Pedro Neto with Tottenham looking at a late swoop for his team-mate Adama Traore, while Liverpool are looking to land a midfielder after a change of heart from manager Jurgen Klopp. Express Sport keeps you updated with all the latest transfer rumours and done deals below...
