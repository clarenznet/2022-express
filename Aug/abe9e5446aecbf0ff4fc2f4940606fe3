  Olivia and John, 68, had channelled their roles as Sandy Olsson and Danny Zuko once again as part of some “Meet n' Grease” sing-along events in Florida. John later remarked that it was a “glorious experience”, while Olivia said she had “a lot of fun” revisiting her iconic character. The pair attended sing-along events over three nights, initially at the Coral Sky Amphitheater in West Palm Beach, where they dressed up in their famous outfits from the 1971 film for a Q&A with fans. Olivia attended wearing Sandy’s signature yellow skirt and white blouse from earlier on in the movie, before recreating her edgy transformation by pulling on a black leather jacket and leggings. John also donned his classic Danny outfit, which included black trousers, a T-shirt and a T-Birds leather jacket.
