And she has considered having a small tipple before her debut on the BBC One show next month – though she fears she may forget her routine. Kaye, 59, said: “It takes a lot to persuade me to dance – usually three gin and tonics. I don’t dance sober." “It’s going to be a big challenge. I have thought to myself, ‘One wee gin and tonic surely won’t do any harm’. But I’ve got to remember all the steps – and how would I do that half-cut?” Kaye, who lives with tennis coach Ian Campbell and their daughters Charly, 20, and Bonnie, 15, quipped it would be a “miracle” if she got struck by the Strictly Curse, when contestants and pro dancers fall for each another. She added: “I’m looking forward to that one.” But one aspect she is not excited about is performing ‘up close and personal’ routines. Kaye, left, one of 14 celebs taking to the floor for the new series starting on September 17, said: “The sexy stuff gives me the ick. The rumba is the one I dread. It’s all sultry and you’re dragged behind your partner across the floor. I’ll look like a wounded animal.” But she feels she is in “reasonably” good shape, telling Best magazine: “I go to spin classes twice a week and I walk a lot. I’ve always been sporty.” Kaye has taken part in Celebrity MasterChef, won Celebrity Master­mind and appeared on Total Wipeout.
