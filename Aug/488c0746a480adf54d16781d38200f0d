How sad that the present generation is so fixated with celebrities and nonentities. Instead of getting on with their own lives they envy others and wish they were famous. Media is vital to the world but it needs to be put into context, where important stories are placed above rubbish that helps nobody. A few days after the verdict only the participants in this trial will be interested, and they appear to have more money than sense. Susan Dance, Harrogate, N Yorks -------------------------------- Action on foreign crooks needed long before now So Rishi Sunak has vowed to boot thousands of crooks from other countries out of the UK. Good luck with that one (“Sunak: I’ll kick 5,600 foreign criminals out of Britain”, July 29). Doesn’t he realise that they have rights? Human rights lawyers will have a field day filling their bulging pockets even more to ensure nobody goes. As has been suggested, we need to get rid of the European Convention on Human Rights in favour of our own Bill of Rights, then we can move forward. But this is something we should have done when we left the European Union. Dick Waring, Fareham, Hants -------------------------------- Why did Rishi wait until now to do something? If Rishi knew about all these criminals while the Tories have been in power, why didn’t he do something about it earlier? Are we to assume he allowed them to wander round the streets of our towns and cities and did nothing about it? Lawrence Forrester, Dorchester, Dorset -------------------------------- Smiling assassin has to re-earn people’s trust I’m afraid Rishi Sunak has to re-earn trust because, as Boris Johnson and UK pensioners know, you have to make sure he’s in front of you rather than behind you. Suddenly, after Liz Truss offered to cut taxes immediately, he’s come up with cutting VAT on fuel. The smiling assassin strikes again. Barrie Warren, Bury, Lancs
