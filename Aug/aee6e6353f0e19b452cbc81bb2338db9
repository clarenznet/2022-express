The 4x4 veered off a main road before ploughing through a metal barrier and hitting a stationary Tesla electric saloon at a charging station before crashing on to the line. A woman aged 33, who was a passenger in the Range Rover, died at the scene at Park Royal underground station, north-west London, shortly before 4am yesterday. The 24-year-old driver was rushed to hospital where he was fighting for his life last night. A second woman passenger in the Range Rover, aged 27, was treated in hospital but her injuries were not life-threatening. Police said a man aged 57 who was with the Tesla suffered less serious injuries. The Range Rover was travelling west on the A40 Western Avenue before coming off the road at speed and colliding with the electric car near a Tesla showroom and charging station. Photos showed the mangled wreckage of the Range Rover on the track by the platform. There were no trains running at the time but the wreck caused delays on the Piccadilly Line. The Met Police said: "Police were called to a collision on the A40 westbound near Park Royal Underground Station at 3.48am on Monday." "The Range Rover had left the road and gone onto the rail line." "Despite the efforts of emergency services, a female occupant of the Range Rover died at the scene." A police source added: "The Tesla was stationary. The other car crashed into the Tesla garage and flipped into the station, landing on the tracks."
