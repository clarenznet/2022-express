  Johnny Depp, 59, reportedly planned to submit nude pictures of Amber Heard, 36, as part of their defamation trial. In pre-trial documents, Amber’s legal team can be seen asking the judge to exclude a string of “irrelevant personal matters” from the trial - including the photographs.       More than 6,000 pages in the high-profile case were made public over the weekend, via The Daily Beast. In the unsealed pre-trial documents, Amber’s legal team reportedly ask for the exclusion of a number of matters they deemed “irrelevant” to the proceedings. They alleged that, “Mr. Depp inappropriately seeks to introduce evidence of the following Irrelevant Personal Matters…” They then went on to list the matters, which included “nude pictures of Amber Heard” and “Amber Heard’s sister Whitney’s reality show video".     They also listed “Whitney and Amber’s past romantic relationships” as not being relevant, as well as “Amber’s brief stint as an exotic dancer years before she met Mr. Depp”. Finally, they complained of “Mr. Depp attempting to frivolously and maliciously suggest or imply that Ms. Heard was at one time an escort". Express.co.uk have reached out to representatives of Amber and Johnny for comment. After a high-profile trial that drew global attention, a verdict for Depp v. Heard was reached on June 1.       The defamation trial, which was held in Fairfax, Virginia, lasted for a total of six weeks. The jury found the verdict in Johnny’s favour, with the actor winning all three of his claims against his ex-wife. Meanwhile, Amber won just one of her countersuits and was awarded $2million in compensatory damages. Amber was ordered to pay $10million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages to Johnny after his libel suit over a 2018 op-ed piece she wrote about domestic abuse in the Washington Post.

Amber has since filed a motion to appeal the trial verdict, but it has now been revealed Johnny has followed suit with his own $2 million appeal. Amber’s legal team submitted a notice last week, claiming that errors made during the trial prevented a “just and fair verdict” being returned. A spokesperson for the Aquaman actress said they "believe the court made errors that prevented a just and fair verdict consistent with the First Amendment".       "We are therefore appealing the verdict," they added. "While we realise today's filing will ignite the Twitter bonfires, there are steps we need to take to ensure both fairness and justice." Johnny’s attorneys followed suit and filed their own paperwork on the counterclaim less than 24 hours later. The documents state: “Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant John C Depp, II, by counsel, hereby appeals to the Court of Appeals of Virginia from all adverse rulings and from the final judgement order of this Circuit Court entered on June 24, 2022.” The actor’s representative added: “The jury listened to the extensive evidence presented during the six-week trial and came to a clear and unanimous verdict that the defendant herself defamed Mr Depp in multiple instances. We remain confident in our case and that this verdict will stand.”
