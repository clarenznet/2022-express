Royal biographer and editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, Ingrid Seward, commented on the scheduled relocation of the Cambridges, praising the decision. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are reportedly keen on moving into Adelaide Cottage on the Queen's 665-acre Windsor estate this summer. The move would mean the Cambridge family would be closer to the Queen as William begins to take on more royal duties as the 96-year-old Monarch steps back from public life. Seward said: "I think Wills and Kate need space to bring up their children." And told the Sun: "Kensington Palace is a glorious prison for kids â€“ they want to be able to play football without being watched from behind the gates. "I think Windsor will be perfect for them, as they will have lots of freedom and they can all be at school together." As the family prepares for the move, it has been reported that the couple is "looking forward" to moving to Windsor. An unnamed source told US Weekly: "The whole family are extremely excited to be moving to Windsor. "Not just because it will bring them closer to the Queen but it's a perfect happy medium that brings them closer to London than if they chose to settle full-time in Berkshire or Amner Hall." The insider added: "They'll still get to enjoy those locations, of course, but by being in Windsor they're only 20 miles from Central London and Buckingham Palace. "And it's a beautiful environment that's steeped in history and such a special location to call home." The couple is also "happy" that their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis will "get to spend more time with Queen Elizabeth II". The source continued: "They'll soak up as much knowledge as they can for the future."
