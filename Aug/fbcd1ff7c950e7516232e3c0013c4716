  Roseanna Christiansen has sadly died at the age of 71, with a cause of death yet to be confirmed. The late actress was best known for her role in the iconic soap opera, Dallas.       It has been revealed Roseanna died on July 14 at Antelope Valley Medical Centre in Lancaster, California. She was famous for her role as Teresa, a Southfork ranch maid, in the final nine seasons of Dallas. Her character, Teresa, worked alongside the butler, Raoul, who was played by Tony Garcia. Roseanna joined the show during its sixth season in 1982 and gave fans a memorable performance.

In that show, she played another maid named Carmen, appearing on the show in 1981. She was brought in for a total of three episodes, standing in for a character played by Marla Gibbs, who originally left the programme to star in her own spinoff, Checking In. Unfortunately for both of them, Checking In was unsuccessful and only lasted four episodes, prompting Marla to return to her role and take it back from Roseanna.         The star leaves behind her husband Steven Rizzo, who informed The Hollywood Reporter of her death. Roseanna met Steven at a bible study in Culver City, not far from the Sony studios where Dallas was taped. The pair married in June 1989 and stayed together for 33 years up until her sad death last month. Roseanna also leaves behind their children, Josiah and Grace, and her sister, Elba. READ MORE...
