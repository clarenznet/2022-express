The proportion of pupils receiving top grades could fall by 10 per cent compared with last year, when students were given grades determined by teachers rather than exams due to the pandemic. The Government has already stated that grades look set to drop this summer, and then again in 2023, as part of a transition back to pre-pandemic arrangements. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, said there could be 80,000 fewer top grades awarded than last year. He added that hopefuls "will be competing with those put off going to university during the pandemic." He described this year as "likely to be the most competitive ever." He explained: "There is the carry-over from the Covid years, increased demand from mature and overseas students, and the number of 18-year-olds is rising, nearly half of whom apply to university. Universities have reacted to the teacher-assessment boom in top grades by raising requirements and reducing firm offers. "As a result of bringing down the top grades, about 40,000 applicants could miss out on their first choices, although it could be as many as 60,000." Students have already been warned to have a plan B in place by education minister Will Quince. A spokesman for exams regulator Ofqual said there is "no link between grades and the supply of places."
