The best Virgin Media deals just got better thanks to a new offer from the telecoms giant that includes a free telly. For the rest of this week, anyone who signs up for certain TV and broadband plans will be treated to a pin-sharp 43-inch LG 4K TV without paying a penny for the privilege. This smart television, which is worth £479.99, not only features a stunning Ultra HD screen but also full access to all the best streaming services such as Disney+ and Netflix. This deal is available on bundles including Bigger + Sports and Bigger + Movies which both feature standard channels plus premium Sky services and full broadband access. Those signing up for the Ultimate Volt bundle will get even more bang for their buck with this package offering over 230 channels along with 1Gbps broadband and an unlimited O2 SIM for your phone will also be sent the LG screen once they tap the buy button. If that free telly doesn't sound of interest then don't panic as Virgin is also offering £200 bill credit instead. This cash is added to your account and can be used to chop down the monthly bills. Here are all the deals that include the free LG TV and how much each bundle costs.
