Chowing down on local food is important, as is the ability to hit the gym to stay in shape while away. The opportunity to chill out with a massage is a must for one in three (34 percent), as are boat parties – and yoga classes. It also emerged beach holidays abroad are the top choice of break for those polled. A spokesman for holiday operator VIBE by Jet2holidays, which commissioned the research, said: “The study suggests young adults want to let their hair down, but also chill out. “It’s not all parties all the time for younger holidaymakers, and they are just as interested in recharging their batteries as anything else. “This is shown by things like yoga classes, meditation, and access to gyms being important for the often fitness-conscious younger generations.” The study also found a quarter of respondents want nothing more than to play beachball on their trip, while one in five (19 percent) just want to chill out and read their book. More than one in ten (12 percent) are keen snorkellers, and only 11 percent consider hitting world-renowned nightclubs as a priority when away. The most desirable holiday destinations, according to the research carried out through OnePoll, are Tenerife (26 percent), Majorca (21 percent) and Gran Canaria (20 percent). And interestingly, one in six (16 percent) named Ibiza as the ideal destination. The perfect group size for young adults is six people – ideally heading away in July. The VIBE by Jet2holidays’ spokesman added: “Our holiday priorities do tend to change as we get older. “However, some things do stay the same, as the study showed the number-one activity for young adults is simply sunbathing. “We expect that’s fairly common across all age groups – although perhaps slightly fewer over-60s would be as keen on seeing big-name DJs.” TOP ACTIVITIES YOUNG BRITS WANT TO DO ON HOLIDAY:
