Johnny Depp, 59, made a floating appearance at the MTV VMAs ceremony on Sunday night in New Jersey. The Hollywood actor was shown in a pre-recorded segment floating in a space suit, with his face superimposed into the company logo's Moonman character. The MTV Video Music Awards appearance is Johnny's first major sighting on US television since he was a guest in 2017 on the Jimmy Kimmel show. Floating above the stage in a projection, the actor delivered one-liners in between commercial breaks. He said: "And you know what? I needed the work", alluding to the recent court case drama with his ex-wife Amber Heard, 36. In a separate segment, he said: "I just want you guys to know that I'm available for birthdays, Bar Mitzvahs, Bat Mitzvahs, weddings, wakes, any old thing you need."
