One local resident told the reporter: "I heard a lot of commotion. Shouting and running. Sounded like a lot of people. “I saw boys running up the road, maybe four of them. I don't know if they were involved or scared." Another added: “It doesn't surprise me. There's always activity on the field, especially in the early hours. “Young people gathering and drinking. Usually lots of lads out. "I've lived here for 36 years. I've noticed it's got worse – you just have to be aware.” London Assembly Member Caroline Russell this morning said her thoughts were with the family of the young boy who has been killed. She wrote in a post on Twitter: “The Highbury councillors will be working with the Council as the police establish what happened last night.”
