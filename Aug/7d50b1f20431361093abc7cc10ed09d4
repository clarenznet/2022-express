Moving to a new home can be stressful, but having the right insurance in place can help those worries go away. Many Ukrainians will be living with host families, or they might be renting or buying their own homes in the UK for the first time. Contents insurance is a good thing to have, and protects against loss or damage of your possessions, apart from the building structure. It means that if there is an unfortunate event such as a fire or theft in your home, the majority of your household items will be financially protected. Contents insurance can be bought online, but it is recommended to check different companies to get the best deal, such as by using a comparison website such as Money Saving Expert (MSE). Tony Forchione from MSE said: “Almost half of renters DON'T have contents insurance. Yet if there was a burglary, flood or fire in your home, your landlord's insurance usually only covers damage to the building itself, not to your stuff – meaning you'd have to shell out for replacements.” Eventually, Ukrainians in the UK may decide to move away from their host family or rented accommodation to a new place. Contents insurance sometimes protects against damage or loss to your possessions during a move, but you should check this carefully with your provider first. If not, removals insurance could be used, and many companies exist which offer deals for insuring your possessions during a move. Ukrainians who are thinking about buying a home in the UK are normally required to have buildings insurance, which covers the cost of rebuilding your home if it's damaged or destroyed. It is usually a requirement to buy buildings insurance if you are buying a home with a mortgage from a bank.
