Maisie Smith, 21, has taken to TikTok in a carefree video of herself dancing in her bikini. The former EastEnders actress stunned fans in her tiny silver string bikini while singing.  After previously opening up about experiencing “self-hatred” due to what she refers to as her “thunder thighs”, the star made it clear that she was hitting out at trolls in her latest video.  As she stood by a pool while on holiday, Maisie was lip-syncing to a song in which the lyric “thunder-thighs” is mentioned.  "I wish somebody would've told me that thighs of thunder meant normal human thighs," she could be seen singing.  Fans praised the Strictly contestant for her “beauty” and “perfection.”
