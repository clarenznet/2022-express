NHS England is putting on prescription continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). The £2 coin-sized devices are worn on the arm and tell a phone app if glucose levels rise or fall to dangerous levels. The sensors last 10 days and cost up to £70 - more than alternative flash monitoring, which is also arm-worn but needs patients to scan a sensor for a reading. Around three-fifths of Type 1 patients use flash monitors. All will now qualify for continuous ones thanks to an NHS England cut-price deal with American manufacturer Dexcom. It is hoped widening availability will lower hospital admissions. Dr Partha Kar, an NHS adviser for diabetes, said the new monitors "will be life-changing". Ex-prime minister Theresa May, a Type 1 diabetic, called CGM "transformational". Dexcom said its NHS deal was "enormous progress" for diabetics.
