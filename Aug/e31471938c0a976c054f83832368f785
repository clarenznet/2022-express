The Royal Family will embark on their annual trip to Balmoral as Brits continue with their summer holidays. The Queen's Scottish estate is often seen as an opportunity for members of the Firm to bond. Balmoral reportedly helped strike a sweet relationship between seven-year-old Princess Charlotte and 18-year-old Lady Louise Windsor. Lady Louise, who is said to be the Queen's favourite grandchild, is believed to love spending time at Balmoral. An insider told The Sun in 2019: "The Queen loves the fact that Louise and James [Louise's younger brother] relish their time at Balmoral, and she has become particularly close to Louise, who seems to have become her favourite grandchild, closely followed by James. "Louise also endeared herself to everyone by looking after William and Kate’s children when they were up here.

Lady Louise recently played a significant role in the Queen's recent Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex's daughter is also due to pick up her A Level results which could have an important impact on whether she goes to university. The 18-year-old has spent the last few years studying at a private school in Ascot. However, Louise could opt to join cousins Prince William, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie in attending university. The Countess of Wessex has previously talked about her daughter's schooling, insisting the royal is not under any pressure to go to university. She said: "I wouldn’t force her, but if she wants to. She’s quite clever." The Countess of Wessex last year gave an interview to the BBC where she revealed that she and the Earl of Wessex are "protective" of their daughter.
