Health officials have re-issued a ‘heat-health’ alert across southern England ahead of temperatures breaching ‘dangerous’ thresholds next week. Soaring mercury will once again be driven by the Azores High, the high-pressure system–‘anticyclone’–behind last month’s record-melting 40.3C fire blast. Experts warn dry conditions and above-average temperatures could hold out past the middle of August. James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said: “It’s looking likely we will see another major heat surge next week. “This could push maximum temperatures into the mid- to high-30Cs in parts of the south, and further north should even see temperatures potentially approaching or exceeding 30C.
