Jayne Mansfield looks utterly stunning in unearthed photos of the Hollywood actress wearing her famous leopard print bikini. The swimsuit was so closely associated with her, she would even wear it to parties and out shopping. According to reports, Jayne could often be seen donning the bikini while she walked down Hollywood Boulevard, signing autographs. Born in 1967, Jayne was an actress, singer, nightclub entertainer, and Playboy Playmate. She was considered one of the sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, and these beautiful photos prove why. Her role in Promises! Promises! made her the first major American actress to perform in a nude scene in a post-silent era film. Jayne took her stage name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. She got married three times, and had five children. The star was allegedly intimately involved with men including Robert and John F. Kennedy, her attorney Samuel S. Brody, and Las Vegas entertainer Nelson Sardelli. On June 29, 1967, Jayne tragically died in a car crash, at the age of just 34. The Buick in which she was being driven slammed underneath the back of a truck and Jayne and two others in the front were crushed to death. Three of her five children were in the back and miraculously survived.
