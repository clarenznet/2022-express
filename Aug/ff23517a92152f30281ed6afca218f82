The interest for the Direct Saver, Income Bonds, Direct ISA and Junior ISA increased in July. The group then boosted the rates on its Guaranteed Growth Bonds, Guaranteed Income Bonds and Fixed Interest Savings Certificates, from the start of August. Savers with Premium Bonds also now have a better chance of winning in the monthly prize draw, thanks to a change earlier this year. NS&I has increased the odds of winning from 34,500 to one, to 24,500 to one, with an additional 1.4 million prizes won in the June 2022 draw. Chief executive, Ian Ackerley, said: “NS&I is one of the largest savings organisations in the UK and we’re pleased to increase our interest rates, helping to ensure that more than 1.3 million savers across the country will see their savings nest eggs boosted. “Increasing our interest rates means that our products are priced appropriately when compared with the interest rates offered by our competitors.” READ MORE: State pension set to rise next year but 520,000 people will miss out Some 25 million customers have Premium Bonds, which are backed by the Government. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, previously criticised the savings provider for not increasing the rates on its savings accounts. She said: “Disappointing NS&I rates have been given a significant boost, which is great news for savers. "This is a real pick up rates on easy access savings and the Junior ISA. “They’d fallen so far behind the rest of the market they were hardly visible to the naked eye. "The current rates aren’t market-leading, but they are within shouting distance of the best around, and they will appeal to plenty of savers."
