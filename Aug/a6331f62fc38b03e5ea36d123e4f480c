 Announced on Monday August 1, NS&I shared that a person in Dorset and another in Buckinghamshire had each won the jackpot prize. The NS&I has also updated its prize checker which lets bondholders in the UK check if they have scooped a prize ranging from £25 to £100,000. Britons can find the prize checker on the NS&I website or on the NS&I app on iOS or Android.     People only need to enter their holder number to check and people can find their holder number on their Bond record or by logging into their account. The holder's number has either nine or 10 digits, or eight digits followed by a letter. If a person is using the app to check, they can also use their NS&I number. A person’s NS&I number consists of 11 digits long and starts with an 11, 21, 31 or 41.

At the same time as checking this month's draw, people can also check for any unclaimed prizes owed to them. Premium Bond prizes don’t carry a time limit, so people are able to claim as far back as the original 1957 draw as long as the bonds are eligible for the draw. Premium Bonds must also be held for a full calendar month before they can be entered into the monthly prize draw.      The first winning bond for August 2022 was for the number 469BR534389 and was purchased last year in August 2021. This Dorset winner was holding £45,000 worth of bonds and has become the eleventh Premium Bonds winner from the county. The second jackpot winner bought the 155HJ070561 bond in 2009 and holds £22,875 worth of bonds. They are the sixth winner from Buckinghamshire.
