Chris Eubank Jr has warned Conor Benn he would ‘publicly execute’ him if he went into their fight at 100 per cent. The two will meet at the O2 Arena in London in a highly-anticipated grudge match 29 years after their fathers fought. The fight is set to take place on October 8 and in a heated exchange at the press conference, Eubank Jr told his rival: "I won't be 100 per cent, if I was it would be a public execution. I’ll be 60 per cent and that's enough to do what I want with you." Eubank Jr has also revealed he wants his father in his corner for the bout. During the 1990s, Eubank Sr beat Nigel Benn to win the WBO middleweight title and then drew with him in the rematch. "With this type of fight I would actually like my old man to be in the corner with me," Eubank Jr told talkSPORT. "I would, I would like that. "I told Roy [Jones Jr] that he would be in my corner for the rest of my career, this is the one fight where I would have my old man there. Just because of what this all means to us. "But I don’t know if he wants to be in the corner, that’s the question. We have to find out where his head is at with that and from there we’ll decide what to do. "Since the fight’s been announced I haven’t actually heard from him, which is amazing to say. Especially early in my career he was there front and centre for all my fights. "At the press conferences, at the weigh-ins, in the corner. And for the biggest fight of my career, he’s gone missing. It’s incredible to say, but that’s what’s happened. "I’m waiting for that phone call, I’m waiting for him to walk through the door and say, 'Okay son, let’s do this.' It’s interesting, but we’ll get there eventually and we’ll figure it out."
