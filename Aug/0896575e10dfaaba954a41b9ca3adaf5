According to Boston-based RR Auction, Churchill was reportedly first supplied with Corona cigars with his name on the band in 1940 as a generous gesture of support by New York businessman Samuel Kaplan.

Originally offered with an estimate of £6,983 ($8,500), the sale ended Wednesday (10 Aug) at £15,743 ($19,159). The original recipient was given the cigars by Churchill, while employed in an official capacity as a wartime attendant between 1940 - 1945, according to the brother of the recipient in a letter of provenance accompanying the sale.
