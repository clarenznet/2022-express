Melinda Messenger, 51, has revealed she was hit with ageist comments after debuting her grey hair on Instagram. The former glamour model looked more beautiful than ever as she snapped a makeup free selfie for her 65.4k followers and explained she was deciding how to transition from blonde to grey. “Well like the trees leaves change their colour through the seasons so do we,” she wrote. “Do I blend out the blonde or grow it out slowly? Any advice from my hair dresser friends and #silversisters welcome”. In a follow up post, she added: “So I saw some of the public comments in the press on my grey hair. “I was curious to see how people felt and it seems there's a lot of anti aging. I wonder if it's because it reflects back our own mortality? “Better to accept that we will all die at some point, so that we can get on with living ☺ “I noticed too that the comments here in our little online community were positive, supportive and encouraging. “That is so lovely to see, and thank you, you are amazing and appreciated ❤”. She concluded: “So yes let yourself go! Let yourself go be free”. Melinda was a Page Three girl in the 1990s, as well as posing for designers including Vivienne Westwood. After the birth of her first child in 2000, needing an emergency caesarean section after she collapsed with pre-eclampsia, Melinda changed career paths.
