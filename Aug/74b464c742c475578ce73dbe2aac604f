The team at New Look compared the most influential women in fashion and their star signs to find out the most stylish one. According to the study, the most fashionable star sign is Aries. Meghan Markle, who is a Leo, came second while the Duchess of Cambridge, born under the Capricorn zodiac sign, came in the 10th position. New Look explained Leos have "a really big personality" and always "want to stand out". Those born under the star sign, like the Duchess of Sussex, are "interested in luxury" and are "a little bit vain," the experts claimed. Fashion site Stitchfix said Leos are notorious for their "fiery, headstrong personalities" and "never back down from an eye-catching piece".
