Madonna, 63, posted several snaps from her evening out in New York as she watched MJ the Musical, based on the career of the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson. The singer looked amazing in a long-sleeved black sheer lace dress, with her bra and hotpants visible. She wore platform wedge heels and accessorised with layered gold necklaces, crucifix gold earrings, and black leather gloves. Madonna styled her signature blonde tresses in loose curls and went for a youthful make-up look. She admitted in view of her 18.4 million Instagram followers that the performance had reduced her to tears: "Thank you for your extraordinary performance as Michael Jackson. "You made me cry @myles.frost @mjthemusical."
