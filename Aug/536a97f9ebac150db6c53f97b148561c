The weather presenter has seen lots of comings and goings on the show, including the departure in May of host DanWalker after a six-year stint. Scots-born Carol admitted: "I try not to worry about things that I can't change. I don't want to go but one day it's going to happen.  "Hopefully, it will be naturally - but I also have to acknowledge that I'm 60 and am unlikely to be at the BBC when I'm 70. It's the course of events." But she does not forecast that she will be moving on, or "not yet". Carol, who first gave weather reports on BBC in 1998, added: "One day, yes. I don't want to be using a stairlift to get to the studio in the morning. But I love my job." She became engaged in May to a mystery man known only as Steve - having split from her husband Jimmy Kirkwood, a former hockey player, in 2008 after 18 years. But Carol has so far not named a wedding day, adding: "We're not galloping towards it. It's nice, as the first time I got married I was young. "You get engaged, and you're involved in the wedding almost from then. This time there is no pressure - it's not like we're going to rush off and have children. "It's nice to enjoy it and do it at our own pace."  Carol said of her new fiance: "He's funny, he makes me laugh, he's very kind and caring and he's romantic. "I get up at 2.45am and he will get up, make me tea and put my cereal in a bowl for me to take to work. "These small gestures are more important to me than anything grand - and they now happen on a daily basis." Carol took part in the 13th series of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing in 2015, and was the sixth to be voted off.
