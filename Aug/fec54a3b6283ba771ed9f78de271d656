Fears are rising over the safety of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest site in Europe - which is located in a Russian-controlled area. The United Nations nuclear watchdog has urged officials to visit the plant as soon as possible amid renewed shelling in the area and warnings of the “catastrophic consequences” of continued fighting near the site. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Thursday night, agency chief Rafael Grossi said: “This is a serious hour, a grave hour and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] must be allowed to conduct its mission to Zaporizhzhia as soon as possible." Former Russian President Medvedev has lashed out at this assessment, claiming it is Ukrainian troops who are shelling the plant, and finished his rant by levelling a threat against EU sites. Ukraine rejects the suggestion they are behind the attacks and have blamed Russia. In a furious message on Telegram, Mr Medvedev said: "Kyiv scumbags and their Western patrons seem to be ready for a new Chernobyl. Missiles and shells are getting closer and closer to the Zaporizhzhia NPP reactor and radioactive isotope storage facilities. They say it is Russia. This is obviously 100 percent b***** even for the d******* Russophobic public... What can I say, one shouldn't forget that there are nuclear power plant in the EU too. And accidents are also possible there." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
