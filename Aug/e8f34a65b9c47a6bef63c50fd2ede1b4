  Olivia died peacefully in her US home yesterday morning, with her husband John announcing the sad news via her Instagram. Three days before, the Australian actress had shared a touching photograph of the couple together. The picture, which Olivia captioned “#flashbackfriday”, showed her husband with his arms wrapped around the actress, as she leaned gently on his shoulder. Olivia’s followers sent messages of love and support under the photo, with Aussie singer and actress Delta Goodrem – who portrayed the iconic star in the 2018 biopic Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You – commenting: "So beautiful [heart emojis]”. Olivia had been battling cancer for the last 30 years and spent 14 of those years married to John, who stayed by her side and helped her fight her illness through alternative methods.
