Details of the case emerged yesterday as his wife, Meghan, celebrated her 41st birthday. Harry's complaint against the Home Office, which also names the Metropolitan Police, is over a decision to deny him the right to personally pay for specialist Scotland Yard officers with access to national intelligence to protect the Sussexes. The case, which was mentioned in legal documents for a hearing on July 7, follows a similar complaint against the Home Office for removing his automatic police protection, which is due to go to a judicial review in the High Court. Government officials and senior police officers have insisted that specialist armed Scotland Yard bodyguards and national intelligence are not for hire and to give in to Harry's demand would set a disastrous precedent. A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office said yesterday: "The court has received an application." It came as the Royal Family marked the Duchess of Sussex's birthday on social media - with one notable absence. The Queen's website neglected to mention the big day after deciding it will only mark the birthdays of non-working members of the family when they end in a zero. Meghan and Harry have established a new life for themselves in California after quitting their senior royal roles in 2020. In contrast, even though they are barely on speaking terms with the Sussexes, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's official Twitter account posted an image of Meghan attending the St Paul's Cathedral service of thanksgiving in June. It was captioned: "Wishing a happy birthday to The Duchess of Sussex!" Prince Charles and Camilla's Twitter account posted a similar image of Meghan from the service alongside a balloon emoji and: "Happy birthday to The Duchess of Sussex!" Meghan was expected to mark her birthday privately with Harry and their children, Archie and Lilibet, in their Â£11million home in Montecito.
