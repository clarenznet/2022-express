Durham's pitch-perfect tone meant she was often compared to Karen Carpenter and her similarly wholesome image in the Swinging Sixties contrasted sharply with the decade's "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll" zeitgeist. Judith Mavis Cock was born in Melbourne. Her father William was a sales manager and mother Hazel a homemaker. Her sister Beverley was a jazz singer. After leaving school, Athol Guy, an advertising agency colleague who played double bass, invited her to hear him play along with guitarists Keith Potger and Bruce Woodley at a coffee bar. Soon she joined them as lead singer and her big break came in 1964 after recording I'll Never Find Another You, written by Dusty Springfield's brother Tom. It hit No.1 in 1965, after the group were named "Best New Group Of 1964" in an NME poll. Combining rich harmonies and simple delivery, they recorded The Carnival Is Over, Georgy Girl, for a film of the same name, and then the lullaby Morningtown Ride, a No.2 UK hit at Christmas.  At a home concert in Melbourne in 1967 they were mobbed by 200,000 fans and their TV special, The Seekers Down Under, was an instant hit. Judith left the group in 1968, aged 25, saying she was not fulfilled musically. In 1969 she married Ron Edgeworth, her musical director, and performed in small cabaret theatres singing jazz, gospel and American standards. In 2013 Durham suffered a brain haemorrhage following a reunion tour. She died of complications from chronic lung disease.
