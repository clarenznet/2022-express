Sofia Vergara of America's Got Talent, who still has a flawless complexion at age 50, shared a snap of herself boasting a very busty cleavage in a white strapless top. The ruched satin fabric barely concealed Sofia's assets in the tight and figure-hugging top, while she accented her look with a sparkling diamond necklace. The bejewelled star also boasted bling on her finger and wrist, alongside some equally sparkly earrings in the shape of bird feathers. Colombian beauty Sofia appeared to have been in a dressing room at the time of the snap, as there were some glamorous outfits on the clothing rail behind her. The America's Got Talent judge sparked a flurry of admiring comments after sharing the photo with her 26.4 million Instagram followers, with one viewer remarking: "I'm head over heels in love!"
