The cows were spotted meandering through East Allington in Devon on Tuesday morning, August 2. It is believed the cows escaped from their field after someone left the gate open. Residents were surprised to find a large herd of cows wandering past their homes at around 5.30am. Sian Baynes, who lives in East Allington, told SouthHams.com she tried to help return the cows to the field. She said "It was a very eventful morning, to say the least.  "Myself, Sharon Mercer, and Sarah and Dan Wills tried to get them out of the ditch and back along Laburnum way to get them up the road and into a field, but they wouldn't come out of the ditch. "So I asked people to block every entrance and I went into the ditch and showed them out, we got them up to Lister Way and back onto the main road, this is when the farmers turned up to block the lane and Soapers so they would go straight into the field."  Sian's 12-year-old daughter helped and was reportedly "in her element as her Nan lives on a cow farm, so she helps herd cows most weekends. "She stood behind them all, waving her arms, making sure that the ones who tried to turn back didn't." Village pub The Fortrescue Arms, located in the centre of East Allington, have expressed their frustration with the incident. They said: "Some idiot left a gate open overnight and all the cows walked into the village at 5.30am and woke everyone up. Luckily they never made it to the pub garden." The cows enjoyed a stay of 45-60 minutes in the village but all were eventually safely returned to the field. The farmer has not yet commented on the incident. Devon County Council shared a photo of the incident on Facebook and urged people to "Please remember to close any gates behind you if you do walk through fields."
