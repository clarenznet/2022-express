Taking to Facebook's Food Finds UK group, one shopper revealed that a certain brand of crisps were set to bring back a popular flavour. The Scampi 'n' Lemon flavoured Nik Naks crisps were phased out around 14 years ago back in 2008 to make room for another popular flavour, Pickle 'n' Onion, which has since been discontinued. Although the lime packet can be purchased in multipacks, this particular flavour they cannot be bought separately, EdinburghLive reports. The Facebook page shared the news and wrote: "Nik Naks Scampi & Lemon are coming back THIS WEEK in convenience stores! Keep your [eyes emoji] peeled! Thanks treatsinstore for the news." The post racked up hundreds of likes and more than 700 comments. Beneath the popular photo, shoppers shared their excitement over the news. One person said: "This is my favourite flavour Nik Naks" and a second wrote: "Yes! These were the best one!" A third added: "Used to love these back in the day. Bloody gorgeous!!" A fourth excited shopper said: "Best crisps ever!" and a fifth wrote: "bulk buy". Others wrote: "omg I need these xxxxx" and "I love this flavour!" Another added: "Definitely need to bring back the cheese ones." Scampi 'n' Lemon Nik Naks are expected back in stores soon.   Nik Naks were first manufactured in the UK by Sooner Snacks in 1981. The popular corn snack started life under the name Crunchy Wotsits, and only came in cheese flavour. They now sit under the KP Snacks brand as part of the European Intersnack Group Today, Nik Naks are made in three flavours with different colour packaging for each - Nice 'n' Spicy in an orange pack, Rib 'n' Saucy in a purple pack and Scampi 'n' Lemon in a green pack.
