Beyonce, 40, looked sensational as she posed in a crystal studded leotard with a hoodie attachment, sharing plenty of snaps on Instagram. The hit singer was posing prior to attending her listening party in New York City on Friday with her husband, Jay-Z. Her leotard featured a low neckline, exposing her ample assets, while also showing off her hourglass figure. She styled her signature long tresses in tight curls, as her hair fell to one side of her face. This comes after her new album Renaissance hit the top sport of the Billboard Charts, making her the best-selling female artist of the year.
