They examined the impact of systemic glucocorticoids and inhaled glucocorticoids. Dutch researchers at the University Medical Centre in Leiden, assessed differences in grey matter, which helps control movement, and white matter, which messages pass through.  Brain scans found both systemic and inhaled glucocorticoid “reduced white matter integrity” and changed grey matter, but not enough to prove clinical consequences. The study was published in BMJ Open.
