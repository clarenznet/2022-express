Royal author Ingrid Seward highlighted how George, nine, Charlotte, seven, and Louis, three, are "not normal children". She said it was "extremely hard" for the Cambridges to "keep their little feet on the ground". Ms Seward added that Kate would have likely been "worried" by the attention on Louis during the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Speaking to True Royalty TV's The Royal Beat, Ms Seward said: "I think Kate has to wrap some semblance of normality around [their children], because she knows what [royal life] can do. "She’s seen it, she's been around long enough. "But they’re not normal children, and I think it's extremely hard to keep their little feet on the ground. "I think this is a danger Kate's very aware of. "Louis at the Jubilee became a superstar, but that would have probably worried her a bit." The Cambridge children made a series of appearances during the Jubilee festivities delighting royal fans. William and Kate's youngest stole the show during the extended bank holiday weekend with his cheeky antics. The spirited tot put on a hilarious display with reactions to the pomp and pageantry. In a nod to Louis' boisterous antics, William and Kate said the three-year-old had an "especially" good time at the Jubilee in a message as the weekend came to a close. They said: "What a fantastic weekend of celebrations. "Seeing people across the nation coming together with family, friends and loved ones has been extremely special. "Thank you to everyone who turned out to show their gratitude to The Queen and her inspiring 70 years of leadership. "From the crowds on the Mall to communities hosting street parties up and down the country, we hope you had a weekend to remember. "We all had an incredible time, especially Louis... " Meanwhile, a source who knows the Cambridges described Louis as a "typical third child". The insider told US magazine People: "He's a cheeky monkey - a typical third child.
