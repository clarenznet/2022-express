F1 star Pierre Gasly was left feeling quite frustrated after talks with race directors Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas. The Frenchman was penalised during the first qualifying session for the Hungarian GP for a track limits violation, which he did not agree with. The AlphaTauri star, 26, lost his lap time as a result and suffered elimination in Q1. He began the race down in 19th after starting from the pit lane due to power unit changes, but was able to claw his way back to finish in P12. Despite being several days removed from the unfortunate situation, Gasly is still fuming and talks with the FIA did not help matters. "[I'm] still quite mad about it," Gasly said after the race. "From what I've seen, it's very arguable whether I was on track or off track. Similar things happened to Yuki and Checo [Perez], and from the onboards, they were clearly on the track."

"I spent 40 minutes with them trying to discuss and find a way that everybody is happy," he commented.   He believes the fact his helmet camera was in use at the time of the incident “didn’t allow any other camera basically to check whether I was on track or not.” He added the footage used to determine his penalty was “arguable." The driver indicated F1 may bring in additional equipment to monitor track limits in 2023. “That’s what we discussed,” he said. “I know that for next year they’re already looking at different options, but unfortunately I was the one paying the consequences of this happening.”
