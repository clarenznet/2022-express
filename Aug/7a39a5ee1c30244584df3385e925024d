This week she sticks to her story with her own GP but then confides in friends that it was a suicide attempt. Sue said: “Audrey is very sorry for what she has done and her first reaction was to keep it from her family." “Family do, and will always, mean so much to ­her despite the sniping now and again." “Once she was able to speak with her friends, and they then opened up about their own struggles, she realised how much they had helped her immensely regarding ­her problems." “Now that is the message that I want people to take away from this storyline, ­the importance of being able to talk to people you trust about how you feel." “Sometimes the young generation might think that anyone over 70 isn’t capable of making decisions which in turn can make older people lose their sense of purpose and begin to feel quite useless. I’m lucky to work with people of every age." “I enjoy speaking to them and taking on board what they say about issues, irrespective of what age we are." “So I’d like to say ‘Listen Audrey, I’m still learning about life at 79 and I truly hope to continue’. I do hope this storyline helps older people reach out and start talking about how they feel and for younger people to be aware of how much ­the older generation still ­has to offer.” Figures show that around 1.2 million older people often feel lonely. The story runs alongside an ITV ­mental health initiative, Britain Get Talking. Jacqui Morrissey, from Samaritans, said: “The reasons for suicide are complex and very rarely down to one issue, which Audrey’s story has really captured." “Our volunteers hear lots of mentions of loneliness and isolation, which can affect anyone at any time." “As the last few years have been incredibly challenging, many Coronation Street fans may have found themselves struggling at times." “It’s crucial we all remember support is available, and feel able to reach out.”
