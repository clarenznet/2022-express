"Flexible friends" - as adverts for credit cards called them in the 1980s - have in fact proved to be foes by encouraging people to spend more than they can afford. Now, the chief of the UK's largest ATM network has warned that "hole in the wall" cash machines have as little as five years left. Already, the number of free cash machines has dropped by more than a fifth in four years, from 52,358 in 2018 to 40,830 today. This is appalling news for those who struggle financially or who live in rural areas - and especially for pensioners. The Government must introduce legislation that will protect access to cash because a cashless society will alienate vast swathes of the country.  Britain has long taken pride in having a largely unarmed police force. But violent crime is on the rise and officers put their lives at risk every day. It is therefore essential that they should have the very best equipment available to protect themselves and the communities that they serve. We would all like to turn the clock back. But not many of us would go to such lengths as Graeme Jones, who has felt the weight of guilt on this shoulders... for scoring a goal that he believes should never have stood in 1972. So he got together as many of the original players as he could and arranged for the match to be replayed. This time, the opposition won. But the real triumph was proving right what the American sportswriter Grantland Rice said so eloquently: "For when the One Great Scorer comes to mark against your name, He writes not that you won or lost, but how you played the game."
