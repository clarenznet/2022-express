As fans eagerly anticipate her comeback single with Elton John, the 40-year-old performer decided to stretch out her legs as she showed off her dance moves. The singer flaunted her incredible physique to the hit song Feel It Still by American rock band Portugal The Man. The video begins with Britney making her way to a ballet bar in the back of the room. Wearing a cut-out red bikini, she performed an array of sultry moves while sporting a pair of sky-high heels before the singer cheekily flashed her bottom. Britney captioned the post: "The video I posted before was not the actual live music I was dancing to so if you think it was cooky, thatâ€™s why !!! This is the original one." The sultry clip racked up an impressive 76,000 likes in a matter of minutes.
