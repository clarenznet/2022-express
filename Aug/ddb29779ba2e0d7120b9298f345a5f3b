The summer transfer window closes tomorrow (Thursday) night with Premier League clubs short on time to get deals over the line. Manchester United and Chelsea are both poised to announce new signings today in Martin Dubravka and Wesley Fofana but plenty more signings will follow before tomorrow's 11pm deadline. Express Sport keeps you updated on all the latest transfer news. Man United yesterday announced the £85million signing of Antony from Ajax and the Brazil winger will be joined by their sixth new signing Dubravka, who joins on loan from Newcastle. The Red Devils have also been linked with a right-back and a striker but it is unclear if they will do more deals. Chelsea are to confirm the £70m signing of Fofana from Leicester while they are in talks over a £77m agreement for RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol, who would join next summer. The Blues also want to land Barcelona attacker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Liverpool could yet sign a midfielder before the deadline but have few major options while Arsenal may sign a midfielder or a winger, with Youri Tielemans, Pedro Neto and Mykhaylo Mudryk all options for the Gunners.
