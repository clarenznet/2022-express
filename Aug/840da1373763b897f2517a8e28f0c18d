The AA has issued an amber warning for jams as 15 million cars - 45 percent of all drivers - are expected to hit the roads. Disruption is also likely due to bus crew walkouts in London on Sunday and Monday, engineering works affecting some rail services and air strikes in Spain and Portugal. Heathrow is still operating its 100,000-a-day traveller cap despite the bank holiday rush. Saturday is expected to be the worst day on the roads this weekend, with traffic peaking between 10am to 4pm, said the AA. Problems are expected near the M4/ M5 at Bristol, the M5 between Taunton and Exeter, the M6/M42 at Birmingham, the M62 from Liverpool to Manchester as well as the M60, M56 and M25. Rail routes affected by engineering include services run by c2c, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, Great Northern, East Midlands, Great Western, Greater Anglia, LNER, London Overground, Northern, ScotRail, South Western, Southern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Transport for wales and west Midlands Railway.
