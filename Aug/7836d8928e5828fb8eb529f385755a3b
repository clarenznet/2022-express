The company announced the route will be suspended from June 5 next year when passengers will need to change trains in either Lille or Paris. Eurostar said it must focus on its “core routes” such as London-Paris and London-Brussels while it recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. A spokeswoman for Eurostar said: “We have taken the decision not to run the direct Disney service between London and Marne-la-Vallee in summer 2023." “Whilst we continue to recover financially from the pandemic and monitor developments in the proposed EU Entry Exit system, we need to focus on our core routes to ensure we can continue to provide the high level of service and experience that our customers rightly expect." “This decision applies from 5th June 2023, and as tickets are not yet on sale beyond this date, existing customer bookings will not be affected.” Direct trains between London St Pancras International and Marne-la-Vallee – a station next to Disneyland Paris which is to the east of the French capital – take just two hours and 24 minutes. They are popular with British families and have operated since 1996 apart from a suspension during the pandemic. New rules for visitors to the EU due to come into force next year will involve arrivals from outside the bloc and the Schengen area having their fingerprints scanned and a photograph taken to register them onto a database. This will apply to UK visitors. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of more than 700 UK travel agents, said: “The axing of direct trains from the UK to Disneyland Paris will be disappointing news for many." “Taking young ones and families to the famous park in France has been a highlight for thousands of British families for many years." “Eurostar has suggested that they have taken this decision based on the logistical implications of Brexit, which doesn’t surprise me.”
