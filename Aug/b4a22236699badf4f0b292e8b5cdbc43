Alex Scott, 37, looked radiant as she posed in a brown checked suit, giving a cheeky glimpse of her black bra underneath. The footballer-turned-presenter held up two peace signs before crouching on the floor and beaming for the camera. It comes days after the star was moved to tears by the women’s Euros, as England stormed to a 2-1 victory over Germany. “Stepping into a new season with #footballfocus feeling on top of the world,” she wrote. “See you Saturday 12pm BBC One”. Many of Alex’s followers complimented how stunning she looked - while others added that they were incredibly inspired by her latest documentary, The Future of Women’s Football.
