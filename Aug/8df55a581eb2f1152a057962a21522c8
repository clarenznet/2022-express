At least 17 per cent of adults have missed a payment – with the figure climbing to 36 per cent among 18 to 34-year-olds. The nation is now bracing for the “most expensive winter in living memory” after forecasters warned yearly energy bills could rise above £3,600 in the new year. Nearly half (47 per cent) of the 2,000 people polled by shopping app ZipZero were not confident about paying their energy demands this year without falling into debt or arrears. Co-founder Mohsin Rashid said: “These findings show how aggressively the cost-of-living crisis is hitting the British public, particularly younger adults.” Energy consultants Cornwall Insight last month estimated yearly energy bills would typically rise to £3,244 from October and then to £3,363 from January. Other experts predict £3,800. Cornwall Insight’s Craig Lowrey said surging gas prices and concerns about Russian supply had prompted the increase. And he warned: “Given the current level of the wholesale price, this level of household energy bills shows little sign of abating.” Charity National Energy Action predicts a third of households will be in fuel poverty if the average bill reaches £3,250 a year.
