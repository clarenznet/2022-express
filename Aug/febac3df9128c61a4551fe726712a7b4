 The most recent predictions from Cornwall Insight state that the cost of energy bills could rise to £4,200 for typical use from January 2023. By comparison, the standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit and over the age of 25 years is around £4,018 a year. The income shortfall for a claimant works out around minus £182 every year or around minus £15.16 a month if they pay their energy bill.    For a person under 25 years, it is even less with the average amount received by the claimant being £3,183 annually. This income shortfall works out at around minus £1,017 a year or around minus £84.75 a month. A couple who are both under 25 years receives £4,997.40 a year through Universal Credit. With the energy price cap rise, this couple will only see £797.40 of their payments over the course of the year. For a couple over the age of 25 years, their Universal Credit claims equate to around £6,308.64 annually, and of that, they will be £2,108.64 for the year or around £175.72 a month. Charities have voiced their concern that a large number of Britons are going to be pushed even further into poverty if their Universal Credit payments do not increase. Many have called on the Government to act as many believe that the current response to the cost of living crisis is “not enough”.

We need a plan to help people through this crisis and end #UKpoverty!” This month, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and 70 other charities have written to the Government, and the two Conservative party leader candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak urging action. Some of the charities who signed the letter included StepChange Debt Charity, Age UK, Turn2Us, Carers UK, Oxfam GB, Scope, and The Trade Unions Congress. The charities stated that the cost of living crisis for low-income households was the “gravest issue our country faces” and that it “cannot be allowed to continue”.   The letter said: “So far this year, nearly three-quarters of low-income households receiving Universal Credit or other means-tested benefits, many of them working families, have been forced to go without at least one essential. “This means people having to skip meals or not being able to heat their homes properly.” It also highlighted that the £1,200 pledge which has already been made to the most vulnerable households was “no longer sufficient”. The charities called on the Government to “at least double the current cost of living support package”. The letter stated that the “most efficient way” to provide this support would be through “further payments through the social security system”.

It said: “Those subject to debt deductions face particularly high levels of hardship. This simple, low-cost action would enable people to keep more of their money and immediately relieve some of the financial pain they are enduring.” Paul Kissack, chief executive at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The nation faces another national emergency now, and people rightly expect the Government to act to offer protection. “Instead, we are seeing a Government asleep at the wheel, and leadership contenders failing to grasp the scale and urgency of the crisis. “Even before the current crisis, the social security system failed to cover the essentials, degraded by years of cuts. People are already selling their possessions, taking on risky debt and building up arrears they may never be able to pay back. And things are about to get far worse. Planning for a substantial support package needs to start immediately.     “Without it, vulnerable people will face a catastrophe on a vast scale when winter sets in. The consequences of sitting idly by are unthinkable." In a statement provided to Express.co.uk for a previous story regarding this topic, a Government spokesperson said: “We recognise people are struggling with rising prices which is why we are protecting millions of the most vulnerable families with at least £1,200 of direct payments, starting with the £326 cost of living payment, which has already been issued to more than seven million low-income households. “Through our £37billion support package we are saving the typical employee over £330 a year through a tax cut, allowing people on Universal Credit to keep £1,000 more of what they earn, while all households will receive £400 energy payments.”
