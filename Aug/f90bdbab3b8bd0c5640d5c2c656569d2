Sigtryggr couldn’t bare to kill Rognvaldr and instead demanded he should walk nine steps while carrying a hot iron bar. As his hands were singed, Rognvaldr took his steps while crying in agony. Actor Micki opened up about the emotionally driven scene and shared a mishap which happened during filming.     Micki revealed he had been inspired by the 2008 Tom Hardy film Bronson. Detailing a scene movie, he shared: “If I could get a little bit of snot or saliva running out of my mouth that would be amazing. “And fortunately, I don’t know what happened by that day I had tears… a lot of saliva running out of my mouth and snot dripping from my nose.” Speaking about the scene, Micki added: “They took this little shot where it just quickly comes out and then they quickly cut away.” DON'T MISS...BBC Breakfast guest told ‘put it away’ after wardrobe mishap [INSIGHT]The Last Kingdom exit: Why did Thea Sofie Loch Naess leave as Skade? [INSIGHT]The Last Kingdom’s Sigtryggr nearly played by different star [INSIGHT]  “I wanted there to be more snot actually,” the actor confessed. He continued: “It was so funny because finally, I have a character where it doesn’t ruin anything. “There’s such a big difference if it's a character like Uhtred and his snot is running, you don’t really want that, but a character like Rognvaldr it’s okay, he can be a little disgusting.” During his interview on the Screen Chronicles Podcast, the Rognvaldr star added: “I got happy and loved how there was snot there and to be honest I’m proud that it’s not fake, that it is real, it’s my own snot.”         As Sigtryggr decided to keep Rognvaldr alive, he chose to leave his brother’s fate to the Gods and when his hands began healing, Sigtryggr accepted the Gods had spared him. Although Rognvaldr survived the ordeal, Sigtryggr met his demise after he stormed the Saxon camp and was punished by King Edward (Timothy Innes). He was stabbed to death by his father-in-law Uhtred, which left Stiorra heartbroken as she had to witness her husband die whilst Rognvaldr lived. As Rognvaldr was still alive when the series came to an end, this could indicate the character could appear in the show’s upcoming feature film, Seven Kings Must Die.  The Last Kingdom is available on Netflix
