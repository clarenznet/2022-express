The family had visited the Liberton Toby Carvery, Edinburgh. for a Sunday Roast on August 21. Looking forward to a traditional roast dinner with all the trimmings, and an opportunity to spend some time together, the family claim they were left disappointed with their experience. Hitting out at the food chain specialising in carvery dinners, the dad-of-two branded the experience a "serious disappointment" due to "cold roast potatoes and overcooked meat". Sharing his experience on Trip Advisor, in a post titled 'Serious disappointment', Paul wrote: "Family of 4 decided to go for Sunday dinner, wish we hadn't bothered. Overcooked meat and cold roasties, looked amazing but were rock hard and cold with no taste. "The best part was the peas and carrots, I'm not one for complaining but, to be honest the food was terrible. £65 down the drain, absolute disgrace." The restaurant manager responded to the scathing review, Edinburgh Live reports, apologising for the "cold and tasteless" food and reassured them he would speak to the chef responsible. The manager also invited the family back with a promise of hot potatoes.   The pub's general manager took to Trip Advisor to address the complaint and accepted the slip-up, writing: "I am so sorry you haven't enjoyed your meal with us on Sunday and I am so sorry that the food was cold and potatoes were hard on your visit, it shouldn't be like this. "I will pass it on to my chef and we will make sure next time you come in the food will be hot and potatoes will be soft. "Thank you for letting us know and I'm sorry you had to experience this. Hope to see you back again soon." The restaurant is ranked 602 out of 2,557 restaurants in Edinburgh and has had over 400 reviews coming out with an average four stars.
