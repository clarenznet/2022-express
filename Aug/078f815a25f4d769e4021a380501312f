Despite a spirited effort, Swarmz was unable to overcome the odds against KSI in the first of two bouts for the British YouTube star tonight. KSI -- whose real name is JJ Olatunji -- stopped the rapper in the second round as Swarmz ran and span around the ring. Those actions would come back to bite him, however, when he was sent tumbling to the canvas by a looping right. Dusting himself off and getting back to his feet, Swarmz shocked many by seeing out the opener but wouldn't last much longer. At the start of the second round, he was clocked on the chin by a KSI haymaker and was unable to meet the count. MORE BOXING NEWS...
