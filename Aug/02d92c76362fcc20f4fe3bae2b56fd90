They said: "Blue shark attacks on humans are extremely rare but have been recorded. "In total, on a world-wide basis, there are four confirmed cases of fatal blue shark attacks on humans with twenty-five confirmed non-fatal attacks.  "In August 2012 a beach in Ceredigion, Wales was closed to bathers due to the presence of a blue shark. "The shark was spotted swimming in between boats and came very close to the shore, swimming past tourists in just a few feet of water." The first shark attack to take place in the UK was in Sussex in 1785 on Brighton beach. This latest incident is the first shark attack recorded since 2018 when a windsurfer was attacked in Felixstowe, Suffolk.
