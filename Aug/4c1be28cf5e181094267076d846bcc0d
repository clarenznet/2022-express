The original Winnie the Pooh book entered the public domain in the US this January meaning that Disney no longer holds exclusive rights to the characters as depicted in the original novel. Now a horror retelling’s first full trailer has landed and it really looks terrifying. Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey sees Pooh and Piglet go on a brutal rampage after being abandoned by Christopher Robin when he grew up and went to college. During that time, the cuddly pair went feral and unhinged, killing and eating Eeyore in the process. Christopher had hoped to introduce his wife to them but perhaps that wasn’t a good idea. The low-budget horror was shot in the UK over a period of 10 days, with the production being careful not to include Pooh’s red T-shirt which is associated with the Disney incarnation.
