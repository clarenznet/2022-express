Mercedes ace George Russell has congratulated Alex Albon for earning a new Formula One deal and reacted after the Williams driver referenced Oscar Piastri’s Alpine contract debacle in his announcement. On Tuesday night, Alpine announced that Australian Piastri had signed a contract for the 2023 season - only for the 21-year-old to deny that this was the case soon after. And Williams star Albon amusingly mocked the situation when announcing that his own contract had been extended into next season. The 26-year-old has confirmed his seat at Williams for the 2023 campaign. Mercedes and former Williams man Russell responded by laughing at the reference to Piastri and Alpine. The 24-year-old replied to Albon’s tweet with two laughing emojis and the words: “Love it!!” Albon's announcement was clearly well-humoured. Piastri liked the tweet within five minutes of it being published.
