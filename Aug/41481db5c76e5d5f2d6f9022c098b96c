The end of the summer transfer window is in sight and there is still likely plenty of business to be done from the Premier League big boys. Manchester United's need for reinforcements was made all too clear during their dismal 4-0 defeat to Brentford on Saturday, and manager Erik ten Hag has reportedly pleaded with the club's superiors to splash the cash. With Cristiano Ronaldo looking like he'd rather be anywhere else, the need for a new forward is painfully obvious. The Red Devils have been linked with a whole host of names, but PSG's Mauro Icardi is beginning to appear the most realistic option, and United are thought to be ramping up their efforts in hope of signing the 29-year-old striker. Meanwhile, Chelsea drew 2-2 with Tottenham in a frenetic and bad-tempered London derby on Sunday. Manager Thomas Tuchel is believed to be keen on adding at least one or two new faces in the coming weeks, and Everton winger Anthony Gordon could be the next one through the door, with the deal potentially sealed before their next match. Elsewhere, the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Leeds could also all make late moves, and with money being spent left, right and centre so far this summer, you just never know what will happen next.
