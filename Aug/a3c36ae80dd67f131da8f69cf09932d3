Nadia Sawalha, 57, didn't let her Greek holiday get in the way of her Instagram parodies. The Loose Women star posted a short video on Instagram which included social media influencer Sommer Ray, who was advertising a resistance band. Nadia took the opportunity to impersonate the American influencer as she performed squats in the hysterical video. She attempted to copy every move while poolside in Greece where she is currently holidaying with her husband Mark Adderley. She looked amazing in a tiny yellow bikini while jumping in the air and attempting push ups only to collapse into fits of giggles. Nadia captioned the post in view of her 516,000 Instagram followers: "V@sommerray and I know we are blessed with great genes, but that doesnâ€™t mean we are complacent when it comes to exercise and healthy eating! "Neither of us ever leave the house without our exercise bands! Bottoms up team!"
