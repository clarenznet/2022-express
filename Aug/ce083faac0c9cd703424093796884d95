Andrew Tate has threatened to break “every bone” in KSI’s face after the British YouTube star criticised his opinions on women. The Nightmare described Tate’s beliefs as ‘skewed’ and ‘terrible’ during the press conference for his upcoming fights. KSI – whose real name is JJ Olatunji – faces two opponents on the same night this evening at the O2 Arena in London. Olatunji kicks off his own card by facing rapper, Swarmz, in the opening bout of the evening before closing the show three hours later against 2-5 professional boxer Luis Pineda. Providing everything goes well, Olatunji is expected to have one more fight before facing long-time rival, Jake Paul. There had been talk of a potential clash with ex-Love Island star Tommy Fury next, but now it seems as though a bout against Tate may be an option as well. The controversial internet celebrity delivered an X-rated call-out during the latest episode of his Rumble podcast. "This is a personal message to you KSI, I had no problem with you, I don’t f**king know you; I don’t watch your bulls**t YouTube channel but when I get banned, you want to go from a fan to just instantly cowering out to the matrix? That makes you a hypocrite,” said Tate who was recently banned from social media for his misogynistic ideologies. “There's nothing more disgusting than a male hypocrite. You don’t even stick by your guns, he doesn’t even stick by his f***ing guns, he doesn’t even say ‘you know what? Andrew was all right he said some funny things he shouldn’t have and got banned’. "At least Jake Paul was man enough to say stand up for free speech. If you ever fought Jake, he would smash your f**king face in. And if you want to get smoked twice, I’ll f**king smoke you myself! "You’re full of s**t, you’re a f**king hypocrite. The s**t you've said in the past is worse than anything I've ever f**king said and you know it. You want to talk about a boxing match, your f***ing three rounds boxing against some nobody. “I will take you twelve rounds and I will break every bone in your f**king face either before or after Jake’s done with you, you’re a f***ing hypocrite as well. F**king dork. F**k KSI." Responding to the call-out, KSI tweeted: “Crying from outside of the club. Jake Paul and you can get it soon. I WANT ALL THE SMOKE.”
