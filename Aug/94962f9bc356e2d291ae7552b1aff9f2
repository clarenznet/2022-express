The 34-year-old died following the incident at the recreation ground in Hillson Drive, Portsmouth, at 10.25am on Wednesday. He was declared dead at the scene by paramedics from South Central Ambulance Service. A 20-year-old man from Fareham has been arrested on suspicion of being the owner of the dog. Hampshire Police said they are investigating. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: "We are speaking to people in the area and carrying out other lines of enquiry to establish how the man died. "As part of our enquiries a 20-year-old man from Fareham has been arrested on suspicion of being the owner/person in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death. "He has been released from custody without charge but remains under investigation while enquiries continue." Police say a dog was secured and removed from the scene. The man's family have been informed. The manâ€™s death follows a spate of dog attacks across Britain in recent weeks. There have been seven fatal dog attacks in the UK since the start of the year. They include a three-year-old mauled to death by an out-of-control dog in May. Daniel John Twigg died in hospital following the attack at a home in Milnrow, Greater Manchester. Statistics from the Canine and Feline Behaviour Association show there was a 54 per cent increase in dog attacks from 2020 to 2021. The RSPCA believes the spike in people buying puppies during lockdown could be behind the rise in attacks. In a separate incident earlier this week, a three-year-old suffered life-changing injuries after she was attacked by a Doberman dog in Hampshire. Last month, a mother was mauled to death in a horrific attack by her dogs in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Her partner suffered devastating injuries to his face, hands and chest as he desperately tried to save her. MORE TO FOLLOW
