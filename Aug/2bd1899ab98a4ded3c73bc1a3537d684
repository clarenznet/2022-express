Former chancellor Mr Sunak confirmed the primary threshold for the main rate of National Insurance would rise by almost £3,000 from July 6. The change will mean that workers can earn £12,570 instead of £9,880 before they pay National Insurance contributions (NICs). On top of this, the Government estimates 2.2 million people will stop paying Class 1 and Class 4 National Insurance contributions and the Health and Social Care Levy all together. The HM Treasury estimates around 30 million people will see their take-home pay increase from July. There’s an online tool where people can work out exactly how much the NI threshold change will affect them. The Treasury’s new online calculator estimates how the National Insurance changes will affect take home pay and can be found at Gov.uk.

The changes will improve the finances of around 70 percent of people who will end up paying less NI than last year. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: “Any tax cut is welcome right now, especially one that eases the pain for lower earners. “They've faced the brunt of the rising cost of essentials because it makes up a bigger proportion of their spending, so they need all the help they can get." She continued: “However, we're not talking about vast sums of cash. £330 spread over 12 months is £27.50 a month. “It's a drop in the ocean compared to rising costs. "So while it will help ease the pain slightly, those on lower incomes will still have a huge headache in making ends meet.” People can check their take home pay at Gov.uk
