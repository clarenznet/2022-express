 David Beckham, 47, has marked National Dog Day with his three gorgeous pups, Olive, Sage and Fig. But the former footballer had his wife Victoria, 48, baffled as he “French kissed” them in a hilarious new video. David could be seen feeding his pooches biscuits directly from his mouth, as Victoria filmed it for his 75million Instagram followers. He could be heard ordering the dogs to “stay” and wait their turn as he fed them one by one. “Is it kind of weird that he likes to French kiss the dogs?” Victoria wondered aloud. But far from being disgusted, several of his fans admitted they were jealous. Ptipitch commented: “The only reason I wish I would be a dog”. “Never in my life have I wanted to be a dog so much,” agreed loopylisaxxx. Lesaheydon added: “I would sit very still for him”. Elsewhere, Victoria revealed on her Instagram that she and David are in Aspen. They have been enjoying a hot and sweaty hike today - but as Posh Spice chatted to her followers about their day, her husband couldn’t help but tease her. “I hope you’re not putting on that dodgy accent though!” he could be heard remarking. “This is just how I talk,” she hit back.
