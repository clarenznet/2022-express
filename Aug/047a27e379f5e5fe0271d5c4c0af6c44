Unite national officer Robert Morton also warned there will be more walkouts if his members' pay demands are not met. Nearly 2,000 members at Felixstowe, Suffolk, are striking for the first time since 1989. Yesterday, the second day of industrial action, Mr Morton said Unite wants a pay offer of between "seven and 12.3 per cent" - adding: "It could be over this afternoon if the employer agreed to meet us for real-time negotiations." Paul Davey, head of corporate affairs at the port, said: "The offer on [when] they voted to strike was five per cent plus £500. It's now seven per cent plus £500." Members had voted by more than 9-1 in favour of strikes - and some told how they are relying on food banks and struggling to make mortgage payments. A tug driver, who did not wish to be named, said: "I am now down to £4 in my bank account this week, but we've got shoes to buy, a school uniform to buy." Dock worker Phil Pemberton, who has worked there for nearly three decades, said: "Where's the money coming from for us to live on a day-to-day basis and be able to start saving a bit for retirement?"
