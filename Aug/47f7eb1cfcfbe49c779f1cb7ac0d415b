Manchester United remain hopeful of signing Frenkie de Jong after Barcelona boss Xavi refused to shut down the possibility of him moving to Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag has made him his No 1 target but a deal has been complicated by De Jong's desire to remain at Barca and the fact the club owe him £14million in deferred wages. Chelsea are also keen on De Jong and are said to have an advantage over United, with the player more open to joining them. However, while the Blues are planning to make an offer for the midfielder, they are focusing on two defenders. Wesley Fofana of Leicester and Denzel Dumfries of Inter Milan are their priorities right now though Chelsea are exploring possible swap deals after being quoted a combined £118m to land both signings. Arsenal, meanwhile, are thought to have four main targets they could still sign after Mikel Arteta confirmed his intentions to bring in more fresh blood before the window shuts. There is expected to be plenty more goings on at Newcastle, Liverpool, Everton, West Ham and across Europe over the next few weeks as well with the rumour mill running into overdrive at present.
