This Morning's Alison Hammond, 47, was all smiles as she enjoyed a desert safari in Dubai with her sister Saunra. The break away came after she learnt she had been nominated at the forthcoming National Television Awards ceremony. Alison was in high spirits as she rode atop a camel and swished through the orange sands, before showcasing her cleavage in a close-up selfie. However she received criticism from animal rights group PETA, which declared the camel would have experienced "tremendous suffering" and that activities involving the "exploitation" of animals should be kept off tourism itineraries. The group said that camel rides were so cruel that the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism had banned them from taking place by the Pyramids of Gisa, while they warned that, around the world, the animals suffered with the weight of tourists on their backs for "hours". There is no suggestion that Alison was aware of the potential animal welfare concerns at the time as there are no restrictions on riding camels in Dubai.
