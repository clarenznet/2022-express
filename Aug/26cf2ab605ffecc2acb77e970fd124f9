Oti Mabuse, 32, was looking sensational as she perched on a ledge with spectacular island views stretching out as far as the eye could see behind her. The South African Strictly Come Dancing star, who quit her pro dancer role on the show earlier this year, was on the island with elder sister Motsi, who is set to rejoin the BBC series' judging panel for 2022, and the pair brought their husbands along to share the magic. Oti was showing off her toned and athletic physique in a pair of bright orange leopard print shorts, paired with a dark golden brown vest top and trainers. The star later stripped down to a tiny brown bikini as she clambered over the Santorini cliffs. Turning daredevil, she then jumped off and plunged into the sea. "Cliff jumping in Greece!!!! another one off the bucket list!" she wrote, before posing for further photos with her Romanian dancer husband Marius Iepure.
