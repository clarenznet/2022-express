Some 40 per cent of us agree that petting a dog or a cat is the best way to unwind. Enjoying a good old-fashioned cup of tea with a biscuit came in second place with 30 per cent, followed by sitting down and reading a book (29 per cent). Bingeing on a Netflix marathon, going for a run, getting into bed with clean sheets and ordering a takeaway also made the top 10 list of instant comforts. The survey of 2,000, by pet insurance brand ManyPets, found the average person feels stressed as much as four times a day. Oke Eleazu, chief executive of ManyPets UK, said: “Many of us are looking for moments of happiness to help us unwind and de-stress. “Research and science show the huge benefits that pets can bring to our lives, being our best friends and therapists.”
