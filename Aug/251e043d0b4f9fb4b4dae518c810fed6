Aine Davis, 38, allegedly helped recruit a friend of his wife to take £21,000 from the UK to Turkey. He is also charged with possessing a rifle that, the court heard, he intended to use for a terrorist act abroad. Wearing a grey tracksuit, Davis appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court accused of three offences under the Terrorism Act 2000. Two were concerned with alleged funding of terrorism in January 2014. The firearm offence was said to relate to from July 2013 to January 2014. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring remanded Davis in custody until September 2, when he will appear at the Old Bailey. Londoner Davis, who was raised in Hammersmith, west London, was arrested by Scotland Yard detectives at Luton airport on Wednesday night, after flying in from Turkey. Kashif Malik, prosecuting, said Davis, who took the name Hamza after converting to Islam, travelled to Syria in 2013, where he “retained regular contact with his wife and sent images”. Mr Malik said: “It was clear from the images being sent that he was with fighters in Syria and not there for lawful purposes and was in possession of a firearm.” In January 2014, Davis’s wife, Amal el-Wahabi, asked a student friend to take the £21,000, which had been raised in Britain, to Turkey, the court was told.  Mr Malik told the court the friend was to be paid £1,000 for the job. But, he said, she was stopped at Heathrow airport, where wads of cash were found in her underwear. Mr Malik also said officers seized media devices, which showed text messages between Davis and the two women and speeches of prominent terrorists including then Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The IS “Beatles” were so called because of their English accents. Cell ringleader Mohammed Emwazi, widely known as Jihadi John, was killed in a drone strike in 2015. Alexanda Kotey was jailed in the US in April for his part in the torture and murder of American hostages. His co-defendant, El Shafee Elsheikh, will be sentenced in August.
