About 40 people were taken to Dungeness in Kent before they were transferred by coach to a Home Office processing facility. No journeys were known to be made on Friday and of Thursday, 24,231 people had made it across in 2022. With calm weather in the Channel, the expectation is the 25,000 milestone will be hit over the bank holiday weekend. Yesterday’s arrivals come as it was revealed the cost of the asylum system has topped £2billion this year. Home Office spending on asylum rose by £756million from around £1.4billion in 2020/21. This is the highest on record and double the amount spent in 2019/20, official figures showed. And there were 63,089 asylum claims in the 12 months to June – the highest since 2003.
