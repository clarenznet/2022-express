The 2022 US Open gets underway this week in what is sure to be a memorable fortnight at Flushing Meadows, with the tennis world waving goodbye to Serena Williams. The American, a six-time champion in New York, is retiring after the final Slam of the year - which saw history made 12 months ago with Emma Raducanu's sensational triumph. Daniil Medvedev will defend his men's title, although the man he conquered in the final in 2021, Novak Djokovic, will be absent. The Serbian confirmed last week he was withdrawing as he was banned from travelling to the US, over his continued refusal not to be vaccinated against Covid-19. And Djokovic will miss an event that has increased its prize money to a staggering £51 million, breaking its previous record of £47.9 million from 2021. The US Tennis Association have confirmed they have agreed the figures with the WTA and ATP Player Councils “with a goal of increasing prize money in the earlier rounds of the main draw, as well as the US Open Qualifying Tournament Prize money." According to inews, the two individual champions will earn £2.2 million each, £400,000 more that what Raducanu and Medvedev walkes away with last time around. Runners-up will have the consolation of £1.1 million each.

Those who make the last-16 will receive £236,000, and third-round losers will have the blow softened with a £160,000 prize. However, it is players who go out in the first and second-rounds who will benefit the most. A player who falls at the first hurdle will get £68,000, almost double what they would have had in 2016 for going out at the same stage. Second-round losers will earn £103,000, more than double the figure of six years ago.

Round two losers will bag £30,400 each, and any first-round hiccups will still earn players £18,000 each.
