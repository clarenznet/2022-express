American conservative commentator Candace Owens made the comments as she discussed the Duchess of Sussex's royal racism claims after she accused an unnamed member of the Royal Family of making a racist comment about her son Archie before he was born in her and Prince Harry's Oprah Winfrey interview.  Speaking to commentator Matt Walsh, Ms Owens said: "This is a Hollywood star going into a country that loves its traditions and then accusing them of being fundamentally racist. "It's the height of ignorance to me to have this D-list actress that nobody knew go over there. "I think we're just tired of the race narrative here in America and it's just obnoxious that we've sent this girl to start the same thing overseas." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL FAMILY:
