National Lottery officials have asked for one lucky winner to come forward and claim a £20million jackpot. Lotto organisers Camelot have said the "Must Be Won" jackpot was won on Saturday, August 6. One lottery player has the numbers required to claim the sum, and they should get in touch as soon as possible. Each lottery draw has varying criteria to win prizes, especially for the jackpot. Saturday's was a "Must Be Won" draw produced by five successive rollovers. The August 6 winner needed to match six numbers and one "bonus number" to win the £20million.

According to Camelot, someone has a ticket with those numbers and must now come forward. The £1million runner-up prize for matching five numbers and the bonus was neither claimed nor won. If the lottery winner does not claim their prize, they risk losing it altogether. Unclaimed lottery wins remain available for some time after someone buys a winning ticket. Winners must claim their prize in 180 days after the draw unless they follow an alternative procedure to receive it within alternative timescales. Players must come forward before the clock ticks midnight on the last day of that six-month window. If they fail to come forward, the National Lottery redistributes any unclaimed winnings. The sums and their accrued interest go to National Lottery-funded projects across the UK. The August 6 jackpot is one of several that lottery winners have not claimed yet in 2022.
