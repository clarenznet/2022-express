He continued: “What I would like to do in your honour is make a donation to the comprehensive services of veterans. “Under your name I would like to give you $5,000 because I know that means a lot to you and it’s the least we could do.” Donn said: “I’m ready to lose it. How sweet is that. “They’re going to think I’m a hero. It feels great to not be forgotten because I thought for a long time we were.”
