The man, who uses a wheelchair, was attacked last month when passing through the Cathedral Green in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Police say the man, who is in his thirties, was accompanied by friend in his forties when the pair were chased by youths around 9.15pm on July 19.  A gang of four young people are believed to have followed the pair onto the High Street, then onto Crane Street. The attack left the man "incredibly distressed" with "potentially life-changing" injuries. On Tuesday, police launched a renewed call for witnesses and information about the attack, believing there are others who have not yet spoken to police who may still come forward. Wiltshire Police released footage of those the force wish to speak with in connection with the attack.     CCTV footage published by the police show four teenagers in a group of three males and one female. The female caught on CCTV is dressed in a white top without sleeves, with one male who is topless. The two others in the group are dressed in blue and grey. Police called the attack "abhorrent", adding the local community is understandably "frustrated" by the attack.  Detective Constable Susan Ellway said: “This was a sustained attack, during which a vulnerable man has suffered serious injuries which have left him incredibly distressed. "The incident happened in a public place with a number of members of the public believed to be witnesses. "We have already obtained a number of witness accounts and we would continue to urge anyone with information to get in touch. “Behaviour of this nature is completely abhorrent and will not be tolerated within our community. "I know those living in Salisbury will be frustrated and upset by this incident. "We would like to reassure residents that we are conducting a robust investigation to identify those involved.” MORE TO FOLLOW...
