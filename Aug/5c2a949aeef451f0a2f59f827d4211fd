In May, the £52million France international, 28, denied seven counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of sexual assault. The latest charge relates to a new complainant.  It had already been reported but not put to the player until yesterday. Jury selection for the trial at Chester Crown Court started around lunchtime. The football ace, from Prestbury, Cheshire, is alleged to have committed the offences against seven young women between October 2018 and August last year. He is due to stand trial alongside co-defendant Louis Saha Matturie, 40, of Eccles, Greater Manchester. Matturie denies eight counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault relating to eight young women. Matturie’s alleged offences span from July 2012 to August last year. Mendy has played for Manchester City since 2017. He was suspended by the club after being charged by police. Both defendants are on bail.
