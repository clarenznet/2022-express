AA president Edmund King said since early June, wholesale petrol is down 20p-25p a litre depending on whether or not you factor in VAT. He added: "But average UK pump prices are down by around 9.5p a litre for petrol and 7p for diesel compared to early July. In many areas of Britain, a 10p-a-litre drop is still a "pumpdream"." Independent retailers have been leading the charge, but supermarkets sell massive quantities of fuel.
