  Aaron looked dapper and when he attended the film festival alongside Sam, with whom he recently celebrated his 10-year anniversary. The Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging star looked smart in a double-breasted black suit jacket and trousers, which he teamed with an unbuttoned white shirt. Sam looked stunning in a figure-hugging black jumpsuit with a daring cut out section across her chest. While promoting Bullet Train on BBC Radio 2 earlier this week, Aaron explained that an incident occurred during filming which led to him passing out due to blood loss. He said: “Brad, in that scene, actually drop-kicked me into a table. “I did cut my hand open and then quite quickly passed out.” He added: “Couple of stitches, but it was all good, because I got my battle wounds from Bullet Train with Brad. It’s a dream right there.”
