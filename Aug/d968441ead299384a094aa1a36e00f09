While holidays are something many people look forward to all year, the thought of packing for the family can be a nightmare. This is especially true if you are battling with luggage restrictions, or trying to keep all of your clothes wrinkle-free. If you are only taking a small bag, or one without compartments, you might also find yourself having to pack shoes on top of some of your favourite clothing items. This can run the risk of leaving scuffs or marks which have transferred from well-worn shoes onto your garments. However, one TikTok influencer has shared a rather bizarre hack which promises to leave your clothes "protected and clean" while also making use of the free hotel room shower caps. Posting to TikTok, user HelloKristen shared a video showing her encasing a pair of shoes inside of a shower cap.
