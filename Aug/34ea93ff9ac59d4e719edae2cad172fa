It is the latest evidence of a crisis in the NHS after figures revealed A&E departments in England recorded their worst performance on record in July, with 29,317 people waiting more than 12 hours to be admitted to a ward last month. The average ambulance response time for urgent cases – known officially as “Category 3 ambulance calls” – was three hours and 27 minutes. And one in ten people in this category waited eight hours and 21 minutes or longer. This is more than four times the NHS target of two hours. Urgent cases include women in the late stages of labour and patients who need treatment to relieve pain or suffering, but not those with life-threatening conditions. The average response time for a Category 2 “emergency” call, including for heart attacks and strokes, averaged 59 minutes in July. Response times have been in the spotlight since a 90-year-old woman waited 40 hours for an ambulance after a fall and spent 20 hours waiting to be admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital. Dr Adrian Boyle, an Emergency Medicine Consultant at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said of the latest crisis: “Behind these figures there is a lot of human misery that needs to be dealt with. “This is not just about ambulances – it reflects a system-wide problem. It is dire and catastrophic.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We absolutely recognise the pressures ambulance services are facing – with call handlers answering nearly 950,000 calls nationwide in July alone – and we are taking action to support them. “This includes the NHS investing £150million to help ambulance services meet pressures.”
