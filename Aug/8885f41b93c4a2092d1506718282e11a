Fern Britton, 65, has taken to Twitter in an "au naturel", make-up free selfie. It didn’t take long before her fans rushed to the post and shared their positivity and well-wishes with the former This Morning host.  The star was dressed in a black top with her blonde hair worn long as she smiled in view of her 116,800 followers.  @Suekruz wrote: “Au naturel and no botox."  @Mankymam said: “Well you won’t be seeing a pic of me tonight. Hairdresser ill so I thought I’d put a colour on…ash blonde to tone down my blondness. Now have black hair…reckon the dye was old though bought in Boots today. All thick and squidgy when I mixed it.” (sic)  While James praised: "Love your new Profile Picture and @Fern_Britton you haven't changed a bit. I loved watching you on Ready Steady Cook and This Morning."  And Tony gushed: "Stunner."
