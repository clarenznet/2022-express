Diana was 36 when she died in Paris on August 31, 1997, and her death continues to attract conspiracy theories. French detectives tell a Channel 4 documentary, Investigating Diana: Death In Paris, that the Fiat Uno's driver could have helped to explain the movements of the black Mercedes she was travelling in. Martine Monteil, head of the Brigade Criminelle, said: "The whole of the world has struggled to accept the Princess of Wales died in a mundane accident." "I have frustration about the Fiat Uno because I like a well-finished business. For sure, it's out there. Unfortunately, we don't have it. But you know the driver of the Fiat Uno, he's not the real culprit. He's driving along quietly and then a Mercedes arrives at high speed and bumps into him. "The responsibility remains with the Mercedes."
