Jack Gleeson, 30, married his girlfriend Roisin O'Mahony in a "dignified" ceremony in County Kerry, Ireland this week. The Game of Thrones star looked unrecognisable from his days playing villain Joffrey Baratheon on the hit HBO series. Priest Fr Patsy Lynch took to Twitter on Monday to share the happy couple's news along with a string of pictures, describing the intimate ceremony as "simple" yet "dignified". Jack cut a smart but casual figure in grey trousers and a green linen shirt, paired with brown suit shoes. Meanwhile, his bride stunned in an elegant pastel dress as she posed holding a pink bouquet.
