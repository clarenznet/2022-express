Emergency services have closed Birchington Avenue in Grangetown, Middlesbrough, in the last hour. Gary Sudron and his son Jensen Sudron, 10, had been magnet fishing in Lazenby Stream yesterday, Sunday, when they found the item, but thought nothing of it at the time and threw it in the bucket with their other finds. However, when the 39-year-old told his work colleagues about the find and showed them pictures of it they said it looked like a "moratr shell", reports Teesside Live. His colleagues told him to phone the police so Gary rang them and officers asked for pictures of it. He snapped some photos of it and they arrived within minutes. They evacuated the street immediately and the area was cordoned off. A spokesperson from Cleveland Police has confirmed that officers are at the scene and the properties have been evacuated. The force said: "As a precautionary measure, some adjacent properties have been evacuated and a temporary road closure has been put in place while police await information on the exact nature of the item - as well as any further advice - from explosives experts. "We would like to thank any residents and motorists affected for their co-cooperation and patience while we work to bring the situation to a safe conclusion."
