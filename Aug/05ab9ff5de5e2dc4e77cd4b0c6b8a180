Julian Jessop, also scoffed at attempts to blame Brexit for the economic downturn, saying such suggestions “fall at the first hurdle.” Mr Jessop, an Economics Fellow at the Institute for Economic Affair, was commenting after the Bank opted to raise interest rates last week by 0.5 percent. He tweeted: "Three points on the #BankofEngland's forecasts of a 2023 #recession that most have missed. "They are probably too pessimistic because they are based on current government policies. In reality, both #Sunak and (especially) #Truss would provide more support from the autumn... "Even if these forecasts are correct, this would be a relatively shallow #recession, with #unemployment remaining relatively low. (Of course this won't be any consolation to those struggling to pay their bills, but some perspective is still needed)... "The UK is far from alone (again, no comfort here, but attempts to blame any recession on #Brexit fall at the first hurdle). “’Consensus' forecasts (and the IMF/OECD) take time to catch up. But many are now forecasting prolonged #recessions in the US, euro area, and elsewhere." [THIS IS A LIVE BLOG - SCROLL DOWN FOR REGULAR UPDATES]
