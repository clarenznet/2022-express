Discretionary outlay on the likes of clothes and home improvements has fallen - but money paid for hotels and air tickets has shot up. An analysis of the buying habits of more than 4.8 million UK consumers shows spending was up 30.6 percent per person in July against the same month last year. There was also a rise in buying fuel, up 5.2 percent in July compared with June, and on train tickets, up 5.6 percent - a pointer to staycation successes. The report, from money exchange app Revolut which looked at debit and credit card bills, found overall spending was up 7.6 percent year on year. The Office for National Statistics has revealed shoppers blew 7.5 percent per consumer July compared with June. Yet despite the rush to travel abroad, people are skipping the airport shops - with spending down 11.8 percent last year. Adam Gagen, from Revolut, said: "Inflation is already hitting spending, which may lead some to conclude that the Bank of England forecasts are correct." "The only area of strong spending growth remains travel and leisure."
