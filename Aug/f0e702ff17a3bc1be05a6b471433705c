But three Supreme Court judges refused to hear the application, a day after the Court of Appeal refused to postpone ending Archie’s treatment. The justices expressed sympathy but said there was “no prospect of any meaningful recovery.” They added: “Even if life-sustaining treatment were to be maintained, Archie would die in the course of the next few weeks through organ failure and then heart failure.” Archie has been kept alive by medical interventions at the Royal London Hospital in east London since being found unconscious at home on April 7. Speaking outside the hospital yesterday, Ms Dance said she felt “very let down, very disappointed” and called for legal reform. She said: “I did say I would fight to the bitter end with Archie and as his mother, that’s exactly what I’ve done." “I hope I’ve paved the way for any other parents that want to go up against a trust in this country and the justice system. It needs reforming dramatically." “It’s not fair, it’s not right. How dare they discriminate against somebody that could potentially have disabilities?" “Other countries offer so much hope and so many different treatments.” Ms Dance added the family were exploring one more legal option last night, but “that really is sort of the end.” Alistair Chesser, chief medical officer for Barts Health NHS Trust, said: “Our deepest sympathies remain with Archie’s family." “As directed by the courts, we will now work with the family to prepare for the withdrawal of treatment." “We aim to provide the best possible support to everyone at this difficult time.” Before the Supreme Court decision, family friend Ella Carter said Archie’s loved ones wanted him to be moved to a hospice if his life support was to end. She said: “If this is Archie’s last couple of days it needs to be peaceful and it needs to be a calm atmosphere.”
