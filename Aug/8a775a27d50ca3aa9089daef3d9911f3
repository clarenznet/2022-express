Alexandra Wilson-Jones, 49, says she has been served an eviction notice in Poundbury - his model village. The future King is a known lover of plants and flowers and has previously said he loves to talk to them. But Alexandra says a letter from the Duchy told her to significantly reduce the greenery by January 2023. The landscape architect began compiling a protest petition when she got a Section 21 notice telling her to leave her home after September 27. She claims the plants are the reason behind the eviction and now she wants the Prince to intervene. Alexandra said: "I am appalled. I feel utterly humiliated. The garden is not detrimental to anyone, it's something very beautiful for Poundbury." "The plants are very much in line with the Prince of Wales's ideologies. I'm promoting gardening. I can't understand why anyone would be opposed to that." She moved into the property as a temporary place while a nearby house that she had inherited from her late mother was being renovated. Alexandra added: "I've got the most support from everybody in Poundbury. Everybody loves the garden." It is unclear if she is being turfed out from her Dorset home because of the plants. She was sent an eviction notice care of the owners and Oracle Estates, based in Weymouth. A spokesman for the Duchy said: "The Duchy has had no involvement in the decision by the private landlord to end the tenancy."
