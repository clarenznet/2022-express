Cameras will follow the University Challenge quiz master, who was diagnosed 18 months ago, for ITV’s Putting Up With Parkinson’s. The 72-year-old star will reflect on how the condition is affecting his life and will look at potential treatments. In the 60-minute film, he will meet Parkinson’s UK president Jane Asher, go to an English National Ballet therapy dance class and play bowls – as well as observing a brain dissection. He revealed in May 2021 that he was being treated for Parkinson’s, but said his symptoms were “currently mild”. The former Panorama and Newsnight presenter joined the BBC’s graduate trainee scheme in 1972, working in local radio and reporting on the Troubles in Belfast. He is currently TV’s longest-serving quiz host, having first given a University Challenge starter for 10 in 1994.
