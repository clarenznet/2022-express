Demi Rose Mawby, 28, left fans stunned with a new Instagram snap, as she flaunted her curves in a cleavage-enhancing bandeau dress with a butterfly wing print on it, symbolising freedom. She matched it with a pair of turquoise heeled sandals, as she posed against a bright blue door. The model shared the snap from Mykonos, a Greek party island notorious for its blue hues, where she has been enjoying yet another exotic holiday. She has been staying at one of the island's most luxurious hotels, Cavo Tagoo, in her own cave pool suite. As she posed, Demi quizzed her followers: "Doesnâ€™t it hurt your mind, me being on it all the time?"
