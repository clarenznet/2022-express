BrewDog is loved by the nation for its craft beers, delicious burgers and relaxed atmosphere. Now, BrewDog has rolled out a massive perks scheme that helps customers save when they go to the pub. BrewDog has just launched a new benefits subscription scheme with massive perks that will help save on spendings at the pub. Available now, BrewDog Plus is priced at £99 and the year-long membership comes with huge benefits including a £150 bar voucher that can be used at any local BrewDog bar. There’s a maximum of £50 use per visit and since the subscription is only £99, the bar voucher gives customers a free additional £50 to spend. Join BrewDog Plus here. In addition, another major benefit is that BrewDog Plus members will be able to get a free coffee daily from any BrewDog bar. The BrewDog bar serves up London’s favourite coffee brand Grind and the perk saves up to an estimate of £1,000 in caffeine. Other benefits that members get with the scheme include free shipping on all beer orders from the office BrewDog website. This means that customers save £6.95 every time they buy a 12 pack of BrewDog’s Punk IPA or Elvis Juice. Lauren Carrol, Director of Brand & Marketing at BrewDog, said: “With customers feeling the squeeze right now, we wanted to pack as many perks and benefits into one great value service as possible. Anyone who likes to make sure the beer fridge is always stocked - this one is for you.” BrewDog Plus is available exclusively on BrewDog’s website here and is £99 for a year. Since BrewDog was founded in 2007, it has grown to become one of the biggest beer brands in the UK. There are now over 100 bars across the world and BrewDog is available to buy in 60 countries.
