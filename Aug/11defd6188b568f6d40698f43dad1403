As the Queen's eldest son, Prince Charles is next in line to the throne. Like many royals, Charles has continually undertaken charity work during his role within the Royal Family. According to royal correspondent Richard Palmer, the Prince of Wales will, however, "whittle down" the amount of time he spends with his chosen charities as he prepares to become head of the monarchy. Mr Palmer spoke to the Daily Express' Royal Round-Up's host Pandora Forsyth about the preparation Charles in undertaking for his future role. Mr Palmer told the Royal Round-Up: "In 2018, he rode back on quite a lot of his charity work. "He rationalised his charities." He added: "From what I understand, that is a process that is going to continue as he goes forward. "He's whittling down the amount of time [that] he spends going to visit the charities, and certainly, putting pressure on them to raise money." READ MORE: 'Want something else in my life!'

"It's not clear yet", he added. He did state "he may well have to do something formally to corden them off from his work as King."
