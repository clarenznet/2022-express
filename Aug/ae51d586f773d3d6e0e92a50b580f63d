Liam Gallagher, 49, shared an Instagram snap of himself sporting a dramatic new transformation, teasingly captioning it for fans: "Ey blondie!" Stunned fans, who are accustomed to seeing his locks dark brown, made comparisons to the late Nirvana star Kurt Cobain. The former Oasis rocker, whose music manager fianc√©e Debbie Gwyther is now sporting a ring on her wedding finger, then took to Instagram teasingly to insist that he hadn't actually dyed his barnet at all. "I've not dyed my hair blonde you lunatics it's just the light n the sunshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine ffs," he laughed. Brother Noel, with whom Liam has an infamous feud, has not commented on his transformation. However, in the past he rarely missed the opportunity to take a swipe at his former co-star, once saying on Matt Morgan's podcast that he'd rather wear a Jimmy Savile costume than anything from Liam's clothing brand.
