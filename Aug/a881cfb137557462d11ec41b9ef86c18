Princess Anne's hard-working attitude to royal duties has won her a legion of fans, and at the age of 72, she still completes a full schedule of royal engagements on behalf of the Queen. Born in 1950, Anne was born at a time when the Queen was yet to ascend the throne, and she was incredibly close to her late father Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
