Members of the public are being moved away from Central Park in Plymouth, Devon, following reports of a significant gas leak. Engineers are at the scene and a 150-metre cordon has been put in place while the incident is being investigated. The park, one of the largest in Plymouth, was busy with people enjoying the sun as sweltering 30C temperatures hit the city. Residents are being asked to avoid the area, Plymouth Live says. Several fire crews are  present at the recreation space, which is near the Home Park area of the city. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: "Gas engineers are at the scene. Please continue to avoid the area at this time."   Photographs show members of the public, including families enjoying half term, being ushered out of Central Park. Other images show a large cordon in place at the park, which features wide boulevards, open meadows and woodlands, with views over the city towards Plymouth Sound and Cornwall. Last month, emergency services rushed to a suspected gas leak in Manchester City centre. Fire crews have been spotted on Cambridge Street, near the junction with Chester Street over a suspected gas leak. Police were also at the scene, as well as North West Ambulance Service's incident response unit. Diversions and cordons were in effect on Cambridge Street. Five Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue crews were in attendance. A spokesperson for Cadent said damage to a gas pipe was reported on a construction site.
