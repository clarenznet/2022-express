For years historians had believed that the violence against Jews did not reach its apogee until Kristallnacht in November 1938. The Final Solution to eliminate European Jewry was not definitively decided until the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. However, historian Hermann Beck claims that the attacks against Jews occurred much earlier than was previously thought – in fact, in the months after Hitler took office. The assaults included everything from boycotts of Jewish businesses, violent attacks, robbery, extortion, kidnappings, and demeaning “pillory marches” to grievous bodily harm and murder. Using newly discovered archival sources and documentary evidence, he also shows that the German elites who ran the media and the universities and those in the Catholic and Protestant churches could have spoken up about the Nazi savagery but usually chose to remain silent.  Before the Holocaust shows that if they had spoken up, what followed may have been delayed or even stopped. It is a book all students of the Nazi regime should read.
