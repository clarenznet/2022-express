The youngster was reported missing at around 3.55pm, with officers deployed to the scene at Horton Road, Datchet, in Berkshire today.  A huge search operation was launched with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service and South Central Ambulance Service drafted in. The search was supported by the National Police Air Service (NPAS). The girl was found just over an hour later, and her death is now being treated as unexplained with an investigation launched. Officers say she was taken to Wexham Park Hospital but has sadly died.  Local policing area commander for Windsor and Maidenhead, Superintendent Michael Greenwood, said: “My thoughts are with the family and friends of the girl who has died as a result of this tragic incident. “We are in the early stages of investigating this incident to understand the full circumstances. “There was a swift response from all emergency services and following an extensive search of the lake, the girl, who was 11, was located at around 5.10pm and taken to hospital but sadly died. “This has been an extremely traumatic and upsetting incident for all involved.  Another said that the girl was seen going under the water and "didn't come back up". She told Sky News: "At that point, the lifeguards came running. She was with a group of friends for a girl's birthday."  The woman also noted: "After about 30 minutes, we were asked to leave the beach, just as the ambulance and fire crew arrived at the site. "There was a police helicopter, air ambulance, and a boat for search and rescue. "I saw one of the adults from the group which the girl had been with, and I asked if I could do anything to help, and she just asked that I prayed for her."
