Sir Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 and went on to star in the first official James Bond movie in 1962. The original 007 didn’t live to see the 60th anniversary of Dr No, having died on Halloween 2020, but now he’s received a great posthumous honour. The James Bond film franchise announced today on what would have been Connery’s 92nd birthday, that Pinewood Studios would be honouring the late Scottish star with a new sound stage named after him. According to 007.com: “Pinewood Studios has announced that its new sound stage will be named in honour of the late Sir Sean Connery. The purpose-built, 18,000 square foot Sean Connery Stage is one of five new stages opening at the iconic lot. Sir Sean Connery filmed all six of his 007 movies at Pinewood in Buckinghamshire, from 1962’s Dr. No to Diamonds Are Forever in 1971. Today’s announcement coincides with what would have been the Oscar-winning actor’s 92nd birthday (August 25), and the 60th anniversary of the first James Bond film released in 1962.” Connery’s son Jason and stepson Stephane said: “Our family consider it a great honour to have a stage named after Sean. It is fitting, considering the amount of time Sean spent at Pinewood, and we know that he would have been very touched by this privilege.” The official James Bond social media accounts all paid tribute to the Hollywood legend with snaps from his time as 007. The caption read: “Remembering Sir Sean Connery who was born on this day in 1930.” READ MORE: James Bond: Sean Connery’s hilarious Thunderball toupé scene 1660216 The Sean Connery Stage follows on from the 007 Stage, which opened in 1976 at Pinewood Studios at the cost of $1.8 million. It had been conceived by production designer Ken Adams, who had built Blofeld’s volcano lair a decade prior for Connery’s You Only Live Twice. The new sound stage was set to be a permeant structure that could be rented out to other productions. On December 5, 1976, the 007 stage was christened in an opening ceremony which saw a bottle of champagne broken on one of the submarines inside. The event was attended by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Roger Moore and many others associated with The Spy Who Loved Me’s production.
