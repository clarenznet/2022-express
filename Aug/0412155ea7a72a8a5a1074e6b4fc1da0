These ladies put the work ethic into the game and deserved the result. Their after-game excitement, enthusiasm and sheer joy was a pleasure to behold. Now I hope the men can learn all the lessons that these sporting ladies have demonstrated and replicate them. In other words, less of the unnecessary open-mouthed aggression and facial ugliness that should never be a part of sport. The women don’t need it to be victorious. Why do the guys? Chris Hyland, Northampton --------------------------------------- Brilliant Lionesses roared on to success by nation Well done Lionesses. It was a fantastic win over Germany, the old footballing enemy (“Lionesses restore our pride”, August 1). When that winning goal went in it brought back memories of a famous commentator called Kenneth Wolstenholme in 1966 when England won the World Cup as he said: “They think it’s all over… it is now!” Well done. Jim Wooster, High Wycombe, Bucks --------------------------------------- Ladies’ game set for big bucks after Euro triumph Well done the Lionesses for winning a hard-fought match with determination, style and in such good spirit, without diving or disputing every decision. Let’s hope it rubs off on the men’s game and that it survives when the big bucks start rolling in (“New goals as female interest set to ‘explode’”, August 1). Roy Daniels, Luton, Beds --------------------------------------- Victory even sweeter after beating old foes Germany The girls did it and emulated our men’s World Cup win in 1966. The icing on the cake is that they beat our long-standing nemesis, Germany. The team looked full of spirit and had excellent skills which should give them the confidence to continue their winning ways. Peter Rushton, Chorley, Lancs
