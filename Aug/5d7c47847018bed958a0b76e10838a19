Cristiano Ronaldo was named on the bench for Manchester United's game against Southampton, but the Portuguese superstar was clearly still in high spirits ahead of the match. Ronaldo had started just one of United's opening three matches heading into the clash with Southampton on Saturday. And he was once again snubbed by Erik ten Hag, who opted to go with the same starting XI who beat Liverpool on Monday. Ronaldo didn't appear frustrated in the pre-match build-up against Liverpool as he went over to Gary Neville and Roy Keane before snubbing Jamie Carragher. The 37-year-old was once again on the cameras for BT Sport's coverage of United's match against Southampton. Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Peter Crouch were all previewing the match with host Lynsey Hipgrave. Ronaldo was training just behind the quartet when he pulled a small prank on Ferdinand. The United forward was watching on before taking his water bottle and spraying his former team-mate's shoes.

Earlier before the match, Ronaldo had also rushed over to the side of the pitch to say hello to his former team-mates. He first went to Ferdinand, giving him a huge huge before shaking hands with Scholes and Crouch before returning to the warm-up.  Ronaldo's future has been a topic of discussion throughout the summer transfer window with reports indicating that he was pushing for a move away. But Ten Hag has refuted any notion that Ronaldo is telling United that he wants to leave. "That’s not what he’s telling us," Ten Hag said this week. "We plan with him and that has reasons, he scores goals. "We are happy with him, we have to fit him in the system and the way we’re playing. That is what he’s trying and we’re trying."
