Brooklyn Beckham, 23, appeared madly in love with his new wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham as the couple attended The Power of Young Hollywood event in LA. It comes amid rumours of an ongoing family feud between Victoria and Nicola, which was said to have begun when Nicola chose not to wear one of her mother-in-law’s wedding dress designs.  Regarding the rumours, he said: “I’ve learned they’re always going to try to write stuff like that.”  Brooklyn added to Variety: “They’re always going to try and put people down. But everyone gets along, which is good.”  The star won an award on Thursday as an honouree alongside other recipients Chris Olsen, Becky G, Angus Cloud, and Halle Bailey.  They looked as loved up as ever while celebrating their magazine cover together.  Nicola opted for a grey Fendi belted strapless top with matching trousers.  She heightened her frame by wearing black platform boots with full glam makeup and showcased her newly dyed brunette hair.
