Photographs show stretches of the deformed structure in the central reservation of the A63 near South Cave, East Yorkshire. One image captures the barriers, which are usually at either side of the reservation, meeting in the middle. New safety barriers were installed along the A63 last year. The road connects the M62 near North Cave, East Yorkshire, with Hull in the east. The National Highways Agency has confirmed it is aware of the issue concerning the appearance of the barriers and are investigating the cause. Crash barriers made of steel are at risk of changing shape when subjected to extreme heat, similar to railway tracks, reports Hull Live, and the authority is looking into this possibility. Mandy Foster, National Highways Service Delivery Manager (Maintenance) said: "We are aware of the issue with the appearance of the steel central barriers on the A63 near South Cave. Our teams have attended the site to investigate the exact cause, whether this is due to seasonal variances or another cause. "We are continually monitoring and assessing the issue to ensure the barriers remain safe."  The project to install the barriers sought to improve safety for the thousands of drivers who use the A63 every day and create smoother journeys for commuters. The roadworks also involved improving road verges, resurfacing the road and renewing signs and streetlights. The work resulted in months of camera-enforced speed limits on sections of the road. But writing on social media, some drivers were unhappy to see the photos so soon after the project's completion. "Road is now totally unsafe and should be closed," wrote one motorist. Another said: "Cheap materials not fit for purpose." A third posted: "More delays sorting them out - can’t wait for the temporary speed cameras in place again."
