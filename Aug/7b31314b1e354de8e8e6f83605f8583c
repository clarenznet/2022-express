After 24 hours of torrential rain, the River Lyn broke its banks, becoming a raging torrent which swept through the village carrying rocks and debris with it. 45 years ago (1977) The "King of Rock and Roll", Elvis Presley, died suddenly of a heart attack at his Graceland home in Memphis, Tennessee, aged 42. The following day thousands of mourners gathered to view the open casket of the singer. President Jimmy Carter credited Presley with having "permanently changed the face of US popular culture."
