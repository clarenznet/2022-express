Christian Horner did his best to answer a challenging question about rivals Ferrari after Red Bull's Max Verstappen sealed another Grand Prix win. The Dutchman won his second race in a row to extend his lead at the top of the driver standings to 80 points.  After starting 10th at the Hungaroring, the calculated Verstappen smartly made his way through the field to finish just under eight seconds ahead of second-place Lewis Hamilton. It was another poor GP for Ferrari, who failed to secure a podium place despite the Red Bull’s starting 10th and 11th respectively. Post race, Sky Sports asked Horner if Red Bull were being gifted the championship by their rivals. He deflected by issuing the response: “Are we live?” He then added: “I can only focus on our performance. We did a great job today. We switched our strategy.” It should have been at the very least a double podium for Ferrari, only the Scuderia once again got it all wrong. Their decision to pit him from the lead for hard tyres baffled everyone in the paddock.

Ferrari pitted him again for soft tyres, but it was too late and he wasn’t able to recover. Leclerc went on to finish sixth, while teammate Carlos Sainz finished fourth.   “And from my side as well, I always try to get the best result out of it and the team as well. Sometimes you do that better than other weekends. “And we also dropped quite a few points as well from our side by having issues but yeah, I find that difficult to say that they helped me because at the end of the day you always have to perform yourself and as a team.” Verstappen goes into the summer break full of confidence after achieving one of his greatest victories and remains in a comfortable position as he pursues a second consecutive world championship.
