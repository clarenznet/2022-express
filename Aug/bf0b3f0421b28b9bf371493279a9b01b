KSI has called out Jake Paul just a day before his fights with rapper Swarmz and pro boxer Luis Alcarez Pineda. Tomorrow night KSI will return to the boxing ring for the first time since 2019 and will make history in the process. The YouTuber will fight rapper Swarmz after fellow YouTuber Alex Wassabi pulled out of their matchup citing a concussion. However, fans in attendance will get two for the price of one as the Watford local is due to face Pineda on the same night. At the weigh-in earlier today, the 29-year-old addressed the crowd and started a savage chart aimed at Paul. “The nightmare is back!” the energised star said. “Three years fam, three years I've had to watch all these motherf*****s fight in front me and it's good to be back ladies and gentlemen. “It's good to show everyone why I am the one. Why I am numero uno. Numero uno! Are you not entertained ladies and gentlemen? Yeah sing it. F**k Jake Paul, f**k Jake Paul. F**k all these motherf*****s.” He then turned his attention to opponent Swarmz, and made a very bold prediction for their fight.

This prompted a response from the rapper who issued a slightly more diplomatic response. “27th, I'm going to surprise everyone, watch," he said. "27th, watch. KSI, watch. I ain't got to talk too much bro." Before a flight was arranged with Swarmz, ealier this month Paul told KSI to 'hurry up' and 'send him in the contract' after ‘accepting’ KSI's outrageous demands to make a fight happen. According to Paul, KSI – whose real name is Olajide William Olatunji – has told ‘The Problem Child’s’ manager that he will only sign the contract to fight him if he is able to keep all the revenue and doesn’t have to pay Paul a fight purse. Taking to Twitter, Paul responded to the demands, writing: “My manager just told me KSI is down but only if I fight him for free and he keeps all the revenue. That’s what they offering… I said hurry the f*** up and send me the contract.” DON'T MISS Should the Watford local emerge victorious, perhaps a blockbuster bout with the younger Paul brother may be on the cards in the near future. While KSI made the announcement regarding boxing twice in one night, he said: “Never been done before in YouTube boxing. “Honestly, I don't think it has ever been done in normal boxing, especially on pay-per-view. Ladies and gentlemen, I am fighting a pro boxer for my second fight, on the same night. I am fighting Swarmz and a pro boxer on the same night. Am I insane? Probably. Am I crazy? Probably. Is this ridiculous? Probably. But are you gonna watch it? Probably."
