  ITV chef James Martin has both worried and intrigued his Instagram followers after uploading a cryptic post. The James Martin's Saturday Morning star posted a mysterious message about “karma”, which left many people scratching their heads.       James, 50, took to Instagram this evening to share the confusing post in view of his 696,000 followers. Without a caption, he posted a picture of the words “Karma is a b****” in all caps. The star’s fans quickly rushed to the comments section to work out what he could be referring to. Motorsports racing driver Marino Franchitti commented: “Karma is a dish best served cold, Chef and it’s one of my favourites!” READ MORE: Jamie Redknapp issues urgent plea for help on holiday       Yvone wrote: “Oh dear what’s going on here!!!

The conversation in the comments section quickly turned back to food, with Valerie Ashdown writing: “Now that looks really delicious.”        “Yum that looks amazing x,” added Sharon Peters. “OMG that looks so good. Yum yum,” Kath Raper penned. (sic) However, some fans were still worried, with Julie Ann writing: “Looks very nice, hope you’re ok James."
