"Alert" is a six-metre stack of steel blocks depicting a person squatting, and is due to be installed at Imperial College, London. But a student union motion says it may hurt the college's reputation because of its "obvious" three-metre phallus.  The work was donated by ex-student Brahmal Vasudevan, founder of private equity firm Creador, who says the work is "world class" and "iconic". Gormley's Angel at Gateshead is considered one of the UK's greatest sculptures.
