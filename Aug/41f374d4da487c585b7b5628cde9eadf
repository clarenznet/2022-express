The Prince of Wales said the Jamaican diaspora “remains a vibrant, well-loved and respected part of our society”. His words were read by the Rt Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Jamaican-born Bishop of Dover, at a service in Birmingham to mark 60 years since the Caribbean nation became independent. Charles said: “The contribution of Jamaicans to the life of this country has been immeasurable." “The UK owes a profound debt of gratitude to the many who proudly served in the British Armed Forces in the First and Second World Wars, and to those who, in 1948, sailed on the Empire Windrush to help us rebuild from the ravages of war." “Their courage, ingenuity and determination, and that of their children and grandchildren, continues to shape and enrich our communities and society.”
