The silver Mercedes looks to have been abandoned after hitting a kerb close to the sea front. The vehicle is stranded at the Hall Road car park in Crosby, Merseyside.  Hundreds of people are flooding to Crosby beach to enjoy the sunshine on the last day of the bank holiday weekend, reports The Liverpool Echo. Debris can be seen scattered along the pavement as the car looks as though it has been driven along the curb before becoming stuck. Dirt has since been spread on the ground where suspected oil or fuel has been spilt as a result of the incident. Express Online has contacted Merseyside Police for a comment. It comes as earlier this month a homeowner who allowed a stranger to park on his driveway finally saw the car moved - some eight months on. Omar Badran's "foolish generosity" backfired in December last year when he let the man he did not know use his driveway in the Stoke area of Plymouth. The black car had remained there in the eight months since and Omar was unable to reach the owner. But the Mercedes was finally removed from the driveway earlier this month and sent to a scrapyard. Omar said: "The car was removed by the scrap guy who took it away. It didn’t cost me anything else other than the legal fees for the legal advice. I just want to move on with my life now. "This entire thing has made me really miserable and so many people have told me I’m stupid for having allowed him to park on my driveway but I was just trying to do a nice thing." Omar agreed to the stranger's request on the condition that when he wanted to use the driveaway again, he would be able to do so. But he claims the owner was unreachable.
