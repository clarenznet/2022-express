Weeks have gone by and Home Secretary Priti Patel has hardly put her head above the parapet. She is definitely one for the chop once the leadership contest has unfolded, and not before time. I agree with Leo McKinstry that this ineffective control, which has become a ferry service, should be at the top of any worthwhile candidate’s list of things to address as a matter of urgency. I would start with a total reassessment of the legal process. Peter Rushton, Brindle, Lancs ------------------------------------------ Migrant crisis could cost Tories the next election The migrant crisis has prompted another excellent article from Leo McKinstry. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss may want to avoid the subject but it won’t go away and may well cost the Tories the next general election. Mervyn Bramwell, Warrington, Cheshire ------------------------------------------ EU only strong on human rights when convenient When is someone in government going to take responsibility for this farce? It is obvious that these migrants are being shuttled across Europe to the French coast. If they can ferry them across the Channel in these boats, why don’t we keep them moving until they reach the Republic of Ireland, back in the EU? The EU makes out it is strong on human rights but this is only evident when it suits. Tony Moore, Preston, Lancs ------------------------------------------ Keep them afloat while we process applications Perhaps a “retired” cruise ship in the Solent could prove effective, providing a large capacity and immediate, safe accommodation for all these migrants. It would also give us the chance to vet people under one roof. Christine Kershaw, Minehead, Somerset
