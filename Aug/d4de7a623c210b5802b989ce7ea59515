Chrissy Teigen, 36, is expecting her third child with her husband and singer John Legend, 43. She broke the news with two Instagram snaps of her blossoming baby bump as she posed for mirror selfies in high waisted lace underwear. Chrissy captioned the post in view of her 38.7 million Instagram followers: "The last few years have been a blur of emotions to say the least, but joy has filled our home and hearts again. "1 billion shots later (in the leg lately, as u can see!) we have another on the way. "Every appointment I’ve said to myself, 'ok if it’s healthy today I’ll announce' but then I breathe a sigh of relief to hear a heartbeat and decide I’m just too nervous still. "I don’t think I’ll ever walk out of an appointment with more excitement than nerves but so far, everything is perfect and beautiful and I’m feeling hopeful and amazing. "Ok phew it’s been very hard keeping this in for so long!" This comes after the Hollywood couple tragically lost their third child, a baby boy, 20 weeks into the pregnancy in September 2020.
