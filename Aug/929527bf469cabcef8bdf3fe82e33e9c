The mother-of-three, who is a patron at a number of charities and organisations, made several royal appearances, including during the Platinum Jubilee. A royal insider told PEOPLE: "Catherine always does her homework and doesn't go on visits on a wing and a prayer. "She has read the papers and puts in the effort. "She is a hardworking person."
