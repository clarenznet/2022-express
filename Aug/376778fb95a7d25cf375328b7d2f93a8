More than 65,000 people liked actor and director Tyler Perry's tweet which he posted to celebrate his friend, the Duchess of Sussex, on her 41st birthday. Taking to Twitter on Friday, Mr Perry wrote: "I’ve had a front row seat in your life for the past few years. I’ve watched you endure things that would have broken a lot of people. I'm so incredibly proud to see how happy you, your husband, and your kids are now. It fills me with joy to say Happy Birthday Princess Meghan." The actor's tweet received mixed reactions in the US and the United Kingdom, with royal fans quick to point out she is not a princess. Twitter user @candigennaro said: "Your title is a Princess, but you’re Truly a Queen! Happy birthday beautiful." To which @suzanne_brmptn replied: "No, sadly her titles are Duchess/Baroness/Countess." @merelaveau added: "Not Princess Meghan no matter how hard you try." Meanwhile, @starflower68 said: "She's no Princess and he will never be King." FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES…
