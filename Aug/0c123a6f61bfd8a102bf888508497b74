They gave him his chance but ultimately the doctors were right, and Archie was too injured and weak to carry on. His mother, Holly, and his dad Paul will one day be proud of their efforts, but they lost their little boy, allegedly to an online “game” and now their best hope of giving Archie a legacy is to tackle the social media companies that feature such dangerous activity. Our thoughts and prayers are with Archie and his family. Ashley Smith, March, Cambs ---------------------------- Hunger for latest gadgets put before starving kids So folk are in such a bad state that children are going hungry, but their parents can still afford expensive mobile phones to carry on their “tweeting” and social media. Family home-cooked meals can be made cheaply, so it is a question of educating the nation on how to produce a meal and leave the phones alone (“Scandal of hungry children who will go without 50m meals this summer”, August 5). Jean Angus, Stanford-le-Hope, Essex ---------------------------- Too many on our planet is behind current problems I have sympathy for people whose circumstances have changed through no fault of their own or who are on a small fixed income and are struggling to manage. I find it difficult however to empathise with people who have deliberately large families. Why is publicity given to these irresponsible people? There are too many of us in this world. Education and birth control should be the priority. Lynette Williams, Benllech, Anglesey ---------------------------- UK must tell EU migrant situation just can’t go on Leo McKinstry’s article (“Truss and Sunak’s silence on migrant crisis is baffling”, August 4) begs the question why the UK is still giving any funding to Europe, and especially France. The UK must show some leadership and bring it to a head. Stop all EU funding for whatever reason and only resume that funding when illegal migration to the UK is resolved. John Fox, St Brelade, Jersey
