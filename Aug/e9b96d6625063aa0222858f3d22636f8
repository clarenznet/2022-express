Meghan Markle, 41, and Prince Harry, 37, got married over four years ago. Not only is it the most watched royal wedding of all time, but it was also actually the third most watched event in history. The Betway Digital PR team have conducted some research into the most watched TV events in human history and found that two royal weddings made it into the top 10 most watched events.  These were Harry and Meghan's 2018 wedding, and also Prince Charles and Princess Diana's wedding in 1981. Even though Charles and Diana's wedding was back in the 1980s, it is still one of the most watched live streamed events the world has seen with a total of 750 million viewers tuning in to watch the fairy tail wedding. However, 37 years later, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding was watched by a whopping 1.9 billion people, making it the third most watched event in history. This meant that it was watched by 25 percent of the global population.

In comparison to other big TV events of the year, 2.7 million more Americans watched Harry and Meghan's wedding over the Oscars in 2018. Prince Harry has beaten the rest of the Royal Family for popularity in terms of a global audience and population share.  Meghan walked down the aisle of St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle with 600 guests in attendance, including Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams and David Beckham. While that number is down 2,900 from his parents, there were an extra 1.15 billion people across the world who tuned in compared to Charles and Diana. Of those viewers, an estimated 29.2 million came from the USA despite the ceremony beginning at 04:00 Pacific Time and 07:00 Eastern Time. For context, that is 2.7 million more Americans than those who watched the Oscars that year.

A further 600,000 flooded the streets surrounding St Paul’s to celebrate the marriage. Those crowds were managed by 4,000 police and 2,200 military officers, with £490,950 being spent on security out of a total cost of £39million for the wedding.  But those spectator numbers had nothing on the masses watching the festivities from afar. Of the 750 million viewers, 28.4 million of those came from the UK alone with BBC and ITV both broadcasting the event. The remainder, meanwhile, were split across 73 other countries.
