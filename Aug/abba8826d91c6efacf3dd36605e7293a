 The overpayments happened as a result of the properties being put in the wrong council tax bracket. East Lothian Council moved 79 houses in the town of Haddington down from the band they originally assessed them in after a review. The Lothian Valuations Joint Board (LVJB) carried out an investigation into council tax bands in the town after a number of appeals raised concerns there was an inconsistency among similar houses.     The investigation saw 127 houses moved up a band. The new bands were introduced on August 1. There has been no suggestion the homeowners who moved up a band will have to pay any underpayments. However, those who were paying too much will be now contacted by the council over potential refunds. READ MORE: NS&I Premium Bonds: Can you boost your chance of winning £1m prize?     Some of the local residents reported being in the same Council Tax band for around 30 years, so they could possibly receive thousands in refunds. Council tax is set by local authorities with the money raised being used to spend on the area and Council Tax valuations are based on the value of properties that aren’t used for business purposes. The value is based on the price the property would have sold for on the open market on 1 April 1991 in England and 1 April 2003 in Wales. In England and Scotland, the bands are: A up to £40,000 B £40,001 to £52,000 C £52,001 to £68,000 D £68,001 to £88,000 E £88,001 to £120,000 F £120,001 to £160,000 G £160,001 to £320,000 H more than £320,000    People are able to find out how much Council Tax they will pay on their local authority’s website. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is the body in charge of assessing properties to ensure that they’re in the correct Council Tax band. The Government department assesses properties when they have been newly built or there has been a change, for example, it has been made bigger. The VOA also assesses properties when asked to do so, such as during a Council Tax appeal or band review.

These include the size, the layout, the character, the location, and the change of use. If people have any concerns regarding the assessment of their Council Tax band then they should contact the VOA. If the VOA is unable to get enough information to band a property in their assessment then they’ll arrange a visit. According to data from the VOA, a total of 49,940 households challenged their council tax last year.     Of those 13,430 successfully had their bills reduced. However, 50 households saw their bills increase and the majority of cases were unchanged. The figures have prompted calls for people to check their Council Tax band amid the cost of living crisis. People can check their council tax band on the Government’s website by simply entering their postcode. When Council Tax was brought in, the Government didn’t have the time to get detailed information about every property in the UK. The Government hired estate agents to evaluate properties but they did this with “just a glance” according to MoneySavingExpert.com. This is why thousands of homes in the UK could possibly be in the wrong Council Tax Band and paying the wrong amount.
