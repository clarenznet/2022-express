Thick plumes of black smoke can be seen rising from a military airbase in the village of Gvardeyskoye, located in the Simferopol region of Crimea, local residents told the Kommersant publication. There have also been reports of several loud explosions that were heard around the territory of the military facility. Crimean officials have not yet commented on the situation. The incident comes only hours after a fire at a transformer substation near the town of Dzhankoi in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. And another reported explosion near the village of Mayskoye. Ukraine has yet to formally take responsibility for the attacks but speculation that Ukrainian Special Forces could be behind the attacks, or pro-Ukrainian partisans. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
