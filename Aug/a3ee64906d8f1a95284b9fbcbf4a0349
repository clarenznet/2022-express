The 59-year-old endured some pretty harsh weather during her Channel 5 show Jane McDonald: Cruising Scotland which caused her journey to be anything but plain sailing. During one segment, the presenter admitted she felt “woozy” due to the motion of the boat. Setting sail from Oban, the star revealed the cruise she was about to go on was very different to her as there were only around 13 people on the small ship.Jane initially mentioned how small the trawler was, she was pleasantly surprised with her cabin and said the inside had a “cosy feel”.Although the 59-year-old was content with the inside of the boat, what was happening on the outside appeared to be the main issue. In a voiceover, Jane told viewers that beforehand she was warned the journey isn’t always smooth sailing. Informing viewers the ship used to be part of the Irish Herring Fleet, she joked the trawler has probably seen rougher seas than this.Speaking to the camera, which was unsteady because of the waves, she admitted: “I’m feeling a bit woozy, it’s really rocky because it’s such a small ship.”After making the comment, both the cameraman and Jane were jerked sideways trying not to fall over. Referring to what just happened she commented: “As you can see!” Jane was holding onto some water and a motion sickness tablet as she instructed people to be prepared.Talking to the person behind the camera, she said: “You don’t want to be filming that, you really don’t.”“It’s the swell that goes with it, that is a problem.”Showing viewers the harsh weather outside, the star opened the door which let in a huge gust of wind as the waves crashed outside the boat outside. She said: “This is pretty rough out here, I feel a bit like a pea on a drum at the minute!”Elsewhere in the episode, the 59-year-old got emotional as she paid tribute to her father Peter, who passed away in 1993.Throughout the Channel 5 show, the presenter mentioned her childhood and touched on certain memories with her dad.One of which she went to Tobermory to get involved with traditional Scottish dancing called Cèilidh. Having fun dancing away, Jane then joked she was much fitter back when she was younger and danced with her father.Reflecting on her memories, she said: “I used to go every week ballroom dancing with my dad, and you don't know how special that is until they are gone."The presenter was starting to get emotional as she commented: “Don't make me cry.”At the end of the show, Jane reflected on her journey and admitted it felt as though her father was with her before raising a glass to him.Jane McDonald: Cruising Scotland is available to watch on My5
