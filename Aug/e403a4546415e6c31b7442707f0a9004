In recent years there seems to have been a management strategy to pull back from public contact by closing down police stations. I recall a time when uniformed officers walked the streets and spoke to people. This is how they gained information about what was going on in a community and who was committing crime. Criminals are cunning and the police need to have the training and skills to combat that. If police had their fingers on the pulse they would have dealt with the problems by now. George McCrone, Penrith, Cumbria -------------------------------- It’s about time somebody realised what was wrong Finally somebody in authority accepts that the police don’t do enough when it comes to investigating robberies, shoplifting and car theft. We all know there is no profit in investigating a burglary or mugging whereas there is a profit in booking speeding motorists. Hate crime is blown up out of all proportion and suits the modern “woke” agenda but does nothing for the average citizen, who just wants to live in a crime-free area. Susan Dance, Harrogate, N Yorks -------------------------------- Decision to close stations was a criminal offence Why did it take HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Andy Cooke so long to discover what people have known for years? The closure of local police stations, even in areas of high crime, was a crime in itself. The absence of beat officers patrolling at times when criminals operate left communities open to burglary, robbery and assault and created an industry in stolen goods. Mike Crump, Bridgnorth, Salop -------------------------------- People now need methods of protecting themselves How can batons be classified in the same way (“Banned swords and batons are sold online for pennies”, August 11)? Surely people need to be able to have some sort of protection from thugs. The police aren’t much good until you have been attacked, and God help you if you harm the thug. Justice today is bordering on a joke. John Fox, St Brelade, Jersey
