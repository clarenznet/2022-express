The youngest child Thomas (Scott Haze) is the only one still living at the family farm. His relationship with his unhinged dad makes up the first part. The second follows Eli (Nick Stahl) as he gets sucked into a crime plot involving a missing girl, a gangster and a gang of gypsies. The third introduces us to troubled, middle child Mary (Kelli Garner) as she tries to adopt a child. All strands come together in the brutal final act. There was one twist too many for me. But the performances are excellent, the dialogue is sharp and director Vincent Grashaw ties his very different tales together with a consistently menacing tone.
