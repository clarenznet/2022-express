That night is best remembered for when John Lennon said: "For our last number, I'd like to ask your help. To the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands, and the rest of you, if you'd just rattle your jewellery." But the occasion on November 4, 1963 was also special for Fiona James, whose actor dad Gerald James performed for the Queen Mother too. She wanted the signatures of the Fab Four - and the moment her father passed a pen to Lennon was captured on camera with Ringo Starr in the foreground. Gerald, who died in 2006 aged 88, had performed in the show with Harry Secombe. Fiona also got signatures from Paul McCartney and George Harrison at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. The autographs along with the photograph are expected to fetch up to £5,000 in the Beatles Memorabilia Auction at the Cato Crane venue in Liverpool. Other items for sale on August 27 include a Selcol Jnr Beatles Guitar - the size of a ukulele - attached to its backing card plus a Cavern Club brick complete with box and receipt. The masonry, from the venue of the Beatles' early gigs, had cost £5 but could be sold for £600, with proceeds to cancer charity The Bloom Appeal.
