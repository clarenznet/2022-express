Michelle Cooke, 37, reportedly spiralled when she found a lump on her breast on Wednesday, July 27. Her family say that she was "panicking and fearing the worst". The mum-of-two, from Crosby, had battled with her mental health from the age of 16, when she tried to take her own life. Since that time, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and often turned to alcohol when she began to struggle. The mum to Jaimee and Tyler, spiralled after discovering a lump on her breast, ringing the doctors to try and make an appointment. However, Michelle took her life the next morning after a day and night of drinking, her mum told the Liverpool Echo. Janet Filipe, 67, said: "She had everything going for her but she had this lump on her breast on her mind. I remember she went to Turkey when she was pregnant and she said it was the last holiday before she had children with her and since her death, we've had people she met 12 years ago there ringing up about her. "That's the type of person she was, a beautiful, caring person. She would spend so much time helping people. She helped the homeless and cooked meals for them. That was her and that was my daughter."   Michelle's mum has now also called for more support for people who are suffering from poor mental health. She has said that there weren't enough services to help her daughter. She said: "There's not enough help for people like Michelle. There needs to be more support for people suffering from mental health problems." Michelle's family are now raising money for her funeral. To read more and donate, click here.
