Time is ticking along towards Thursday night's transfer deadline and Manchester United still have plenty of business to conclude. Thankfully for Erik ten Hag and transfer chief John Murtough, a major breakthrough in negotiations for Antony could pave the way for other deals to kick up a notch. After months of pushing from both the player and the club, it looks like United may finally get their hands on Antony with Ajax admitting defeat following a mammoth bid. The Brazilian had been left out of the past two matchday squads as he tried to force through a move. PSV Eindhoven star Cody Gakpo remains an attacking target and could follow Antony to the Premier League in a move that would be even more likely if Cristiano Ronaldo jumps ship. The Portuguese is once again being shopped around Europe by super-agent Jorge Mendes and it remains to be seen whether anyone will bite before September 1.
