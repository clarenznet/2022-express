There are just over two weeks to go until the summer transfer window slams shut with both Manchester United and Chelsea particularly involved in the latest drama. Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag may finally be closing in on a new attacker after giving chase for weeks, while the Blues are eyeing up two more deals to add to their collection. United are reportedly closing in on a left-field deal to sign Matheus Cunha for £42million. Man Utd had initially moved for Antony but have been searching for alternatives after being priced out of a move by Ajax. Chelsea, meanwhile, are working on two deals to take their total signings for the summer to seven. A £12.6m agreement with Inter Milan for 19-year-old Cesare Casadei could be struck today while the Blues have also submitted a fresh and improved bid for Anthony Gordon. Everton rebuffed their first offer but the player has told Frank Lampard he wants to join Chelsea and may force the Toffees' hand. Chelsea and United remain in the hunt for Frenkie de Jong but the saga looks set to go right down to the wire. Meanwhile, the likes of Arsenal, Newcastle, West Ham and Liverpool could still do some late business with reinforcements being eyed.
