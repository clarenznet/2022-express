Dr Gail Milligan, 47, was found in woodland in Bracknell, Berks, 24 hours after she was reported missing. In tribute, her husband Christopher Milligan wrote: "It's such a sad waste of a wonderful, beautiful, funny and absolutely bananas wife, mother and doctor."  Four days a week, his wife left for Camberley Health Centre, Surrey, at 6.45am. She returned at 8pm but worked to 11pm. On her Thursdays off she worked 12 hours from home and at weekends. He added: "Her job became overwhelming. Especially during the pandemic. The pressure of not making mistakes, and endless emails and paperwork meant she'd been neglecting herself. "Next time you hear someone bang on about lazy doctors, please... think about my wife." Police are not treating the death as suspicious.
