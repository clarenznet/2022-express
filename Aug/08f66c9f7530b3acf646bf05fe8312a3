The UK Ministry of Defence announced the move "as part of an enduring commitment to help the country defend itself against Russia’s illegal invasion". Although the number of artillery to be provided was not specified, the MoD said it will provide Ukraine with multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) and a "significant number" of precision-guided M31A1 missiles. The M31A1 missiles can strike targets up to 80km away. The support is expected to enable Ukraine to "continue to defend itself against Russian heavy artillery", the UK MoD said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “This latest tranche of military support will enable the Armed Forces of Ukraine to continue to defend against Russian aggression and the indiscriminate use of long-range artillery. “Our continued support sends a very clear message, Britain and the international community remain opposed to this illegal war and will stand shoulder-to-shoulder, providing defensive military aid to Ukraine to help them defend against Putin’s invasion.” READ MORE: Russia heats up as Ukraine war conscripts see barracks destroyed  It comes as the UK has already gifted Ukraine a large number of heavy artillery in June, and trained Ukrainian troops in using them.
