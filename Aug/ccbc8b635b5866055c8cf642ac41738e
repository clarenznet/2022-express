Ben Habib said it was time for the Government to make good on its Brexit pledge to take back control, almost three years after the 2019 election - by taking unilateral action in the national interest. Mr Habib was commenting on the failure to stem the tide of migrants crossing the channel as well as resolve the ongoing issues related to the Northern Ireland Protocol, the controversial mechanism intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland which critics claim has instead resulted in a border down the Irish Sea. He told Express.co.uk: “Could someone please inform Her Majesty’s Government that Parliament is Sovereign and it has a significant majority in Parliament? “Our Government acts as if it is a minority government of a vassal state. Every time it wishes to do something it either trots off to one foreign power or another to seek their prior agreement/support and then blames them when it fails. “Three years into this administration it has still not solved the Northern Ireland problem because HMG insists on doing so in agreement with the EU. It has still not taken control of our borders, because HMG seeks either for the French to do our job for us or for the ECHR not to stand in the way of its crazy Rwandan plan.” Mr Habib added: “Remember, the Rwandan plan is a deportation plan, not border control. It is failed border control that requires a deportation plan. If HMG simply properly physically monitored our borders, the problem would disappear. The ECHR is a red herring. “Our government must learn the value of acting UNILATERALLY in the interests of the United Kingdom. It was not elected to spend endless hours in negotiations with foreign powers that are mostly hostile to our aims. It already has the requisite authorities and power domestically to charter a path for the UK. It needs to get on with it.” THIS IS A LIVE BLOG: SCROLL DOWN FOR REGULAR UPDATES
