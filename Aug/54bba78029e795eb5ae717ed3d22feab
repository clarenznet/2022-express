Callan Kemp travelled some 70 miles from his home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, to the then yet-to-open café in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester. He arrived at 4pm on Saturday and then waited almost two days for the branch to open its doors at 7am on Tuesday morning, reports Manchester Evening News.    A spokesperson for the chain was unable to confirm his exact movements over this period, but said: "I believe he stayed in his car until the restaurant’s official opening." Another customer, Sam Greenwood, performed a similar feat of retail endurance, setting up camp on deckchairs outside the Trafford branch at 8pm on Sunday evening with his partner. He then became the first walk-in customer on Monday morning, and also won free drinks every day for a year. The chain, which specialises in breakfasts, pastries, donuts and coffee, is going in for an aggressive expansion plan in the UK. It also recently opened a new branch on the edge of the Arndale Centre, just by Market Street tram stop. The Trafford Park drive-thru is a two-storey branch, close to the Asda and the Costco and opposite the Trafford Centre. Kevin Hydes, chief commercial officer of Tim Hortons franchises in the UK, said: "The Greater Manchester community has welcomed us with open arms over the years, so we are delighted to now be officially open this two-storey site at Trafford Park. "We’ve already seen a tremendous turnout and our team can’t wait to welcome guests to this flagship venue with our renowned Canadian offering. "This is officially our largest drive-thru in the UK, so wanted to make sure it was a special one." The chain has previously opened branches in Sale and Altrincham in 2017, however the Sale branch closed in 2020, and the Altrincham branch will close in September, with its staff being transferred to the Trafford Centre branch. There are other branches on Wilmslow Road in Rusholme, on Bury New Road (and another in Bury town centre) and one in Stockport. There are 60 in all in the UK.
