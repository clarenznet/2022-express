The starry production will feature a performance from the upcoming theatre show Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby. The smash-hit crime series is one of the most popular TV programmes ever to be set in Birmingham, and fans will get a taster for the stage version at tonight’s ceremony. Written and adapted for the theatre by the TV show’s creator Steven Knight, the production will receive its world premiere at Birmingham Hippodrome on September 27. The series stars Cillian Murphy as gang boss Thomas Shelby. And British singer Laura Mvula will also pay homage to the Blinders gang tonight, performing a new track inspired by Nick Cave’s Red Right Hand, the series’ theme song. The closing ceremony at the Alexander Stadium will feature performances from artists including Beverley Knight, Dexys Midnight Runners, Goldie and Musical Youth. Legendary Birmingham band UB40 will also be appearing. Martin Green, chief creative officer of the Games, said: “With this closing ceremony, we wanted to create a spectacular line-up of global artists from the West Midlands for an exhilarating musical production to conclude an unforgettable 11 days.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “I am particularly proud of the city of Birmingham for being fantastic hosts and welcoming our Commonwealth friends with open arms.”
