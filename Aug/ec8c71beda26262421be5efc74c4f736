Criminals are cashing in on "revenge porn" pictures and videos posted by ex-partners after discovering the victims' identities. BBC's Panorama discovered how a sordid marketplace has grown where images of young women and their personal details are sold. One told how a stranger tried to blackmail her into having sex with him by threatening to send intimate images of her to her family. He warned: "I will come and find you. If you don't agree to having sex with me, I will rape you." She was so distressed she tried to kill herself. She added: "Being a Pakistani girl, it's not right in our community for us to even get sexual before marriage." Another woman was contacted by a man she had never met who said her explicit images were being shared on the internet. She said: "I can't even compute how many people might have seen them." The marketing of sexual images and personal details is seen as a sinister evolution of "revenge porn." Bitter ex-partners post explicit pictures on to humiliate them. Much of it is taken without their knowledge or consent. Some use hackers to find victims' identities, a practice known as doxing. In a programme shown last night, investigators tracked down a man it claime set up one of the trading groups. He said it was to "appreciate south Asian women" but shut it down. The social media platform used said it removed 88,000 non-consensual sexual images last year.
