Teddy Sheringham has recalled a wild minibus brawl with Roy Keane as tempers flared at Manchester United 24 years ago. Keane didn't speak to the treble-winning striker for almost four years in the aftermath, despite the pair remaining teammates at Old Trafford. In Matt Dickinson's book '1999: Manchester United, the Treble and All That', he spoke with Sheringham about his fractious affinity with Keane. The duo played together at Nottingham Forest in the 1991/92 season and shared an 'awkward' relationship before linking up again at United when Sheringham joined from Tottenham Hotspur in 1997. On a night out in 1998, celebrating Eric Harrison's retirement, Keane, who the book claims is known to be unpredictable in his behaviour, especially after a drink, made his disliking toward Sheringham known. In a minibus heading back to Cheshire also containing Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin, among others, the Irishman suddenly aimed fire. Sheringham recalled: "All of a sudden, Keany said, 'Why don't you f*** off back to London in your f***ing red Ferrari and your penthouse?' I went 'Eh?' And he says, 'Yeah, f*** off back to London.' I'm like, 'Are you coming for me, Keany? Why are you coming for me, you Paddy? F***ing what?' And he went 'f*** off', and he goes on 'f***ing red Ferrari, penthouse..."

The night ended with Keane storming off into the night, and Sheringham admitted he 'couldn't sleep' thinking about what could potentially explode in training. He arrived in the dressing room to see Keane sitting in the cubicle next to him, expecting round two. But he told Dickinson: "Keany gets up and walks out. He didn't say a word to me. He didn't say a word to me for the next three-and-a-half years." When pressed on the fact they were teammates for three years after the incident, he insisted the Red Devils skipper said 'nothing' to him over that period.

They didn't converse in team meetings, in the dressing room or while games were going on. His treatment mirrored that of Peter Schmeichel, who shared agonising tension with Keane due to their clash of alpha personalities in the dressing room. But all is peaceful between Sheringham and Keane now after a shake of hands during their first embrace post-playing careers, with plenty of stories to tell from on and off the pitch.
