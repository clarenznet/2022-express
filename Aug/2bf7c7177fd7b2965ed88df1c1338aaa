Aaron Bell, 17, and Louis Banks, 18, suffered devastating injuries when the Alfa Romeo they were in crashed in the Yorkshire Dales on Friday night. Another teenager lost his life in the accident, while a fourth - the 18-year-old driver - was seriously injured and is in hospital. Neither have yet been named. The four friends - all understood to be pupils at Bedale High School - were travelling in a grey Alfa Romeo on the B6268 near Bedale when it veered off the road at around 11pm. North Yorkshire Police does not believe any other cars were involved. Yesterday devastated Wensleydale Rugby Club paid tribute to Aaron and Louis. It said: "Both lads started playing at Wensleydale aged seven, and last season Aaron became a regular in the senior squad, scoring tries for fun for both the first and second team. You couldn't find nicer lads than these two and they were an absolute pleasure to coach. You will both be sorely missed and always a part of our club."  North Yorkshire Soccer Academy said: "Aaron Bell was a phenomenal footballer, rugby and cricketer. He had the most cheeky grin and had an unbelievable attitude to all sports. He was an all-round great kid too. "We will remember Aaron for his tenacity, pace and power and, of course, that beaming smile." Hundreds of people also shared their heartache over the loss of the lads, both from farming families. Friend Elise Lee said: "You guys were taken from us too soon.We all love you and we hope you're in a better place.You were truly amazing." And Miaisie Clark said: "I'm in utter shock.You've broken many hearts."
