The Duke of Sussex appears to be "at odds with his message", climate campaigner Anna Hughes said after it was reported Prince Harry boarded a £7.67million Bombardier Challenger 600 to fly from California to Aspen, Colorado, for his charity polo tournament despite having often spoken with concern about climate change. Ms Hughes, director of Flight Free UK, told the Daily Mail: "He has so much potential to do good but he keeps taking private jets. It seems to be at odds with his message." The campaigner hasn't been the only one to criticise the Duke for this choice, in particular after it was claimed his Colorado-bound private jet, to which he had travelled using an electric car, remained idling on the tarmac for a few minutes while waiting for his staff to bring him his polo kit in a separate car. Among the critics, GB News host Dan Wootton wrote on Twitter: "Prince Harry arrived for a flight on a private jet for a one-day polo match - before the aircraft sat idling on the tarmac for at least 30 minutes as it waited for his staff to arrive in a gas-guzzling SUV to drop off his polo kit. Ignore his preaching!" Similarly, during a panel discussing the issue, Talk TV host James Max said: "What I really disagree with is this kind of double standard which is if you are going to preach us about the environment, you are in a privileged position, perhaps you can get us to change our ways, you've got to lead by example." In September 2019, after Harry and Meghan Markle had been criticised for making four private jet trips within 11 days, the Duke said he mostly travels using commercial flights. However, he added: "Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe – it’s generally as simple as that."
