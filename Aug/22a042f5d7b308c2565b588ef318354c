Nile Gardiner, a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, has revealed a wave of American businessmen coming to the United Kingdom despite the liberal media "hissing" at Brexit. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Gardiner said: "The East and West Coast elites sneer at British sovereignty, worship Brussels and cheer the imminent departure of their hated transatlantic nemesis, Boris Johnson." But, he added: "Despite their mocking tone, however, there is a growing exodus of wealthy elites from big Democrat-run US states, particularly from California, with many executives now ironically relocating to Brexit Britain. As much as US elites like to hiss at Brexit, Global Britain, free of the shackles of the EU, is an increasingly attractive place to do business for Americans, especially in comparison to Left-wing California, frequently derided today as a socialist basket case by US conservatives." Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, is amongst the people abandoning the US for Brexit Britain, as is former deputy Prime Minister and ardent Remainer Nick Clegg, who relocated to Silicon Valley for social media giant Meta in 2018.
