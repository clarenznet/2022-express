Mr Lavrov has described Pelosi's visit to Taiwan as a show of US "entitlement" and "lawlessness," giving the impression that it can "do whatever it wants with impunity". He went on to compare it to US support for Ukraine against Russia. He said: "It reflects the line we have been talking about in relation to the Ukrainian situation. This an ambition to prove to everyone their impunity and to show their entitlement: I can do whatever I want." Ms Pelosi, who is third in line to the US presidency, touched down in Taiwan - becoming the first Speaker to visit the contested territory in 25 years. China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. But Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims and says only its people can decide the island's future, with the US promising to help defend its sovereignty. In response to Ms Pelosi's visit, China has launched military drills which have invaded Taiwan's territory. FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
