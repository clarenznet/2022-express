This week, the Duchess of Sussex said in an interview with American magazine The Cut that she was trying to “forgive” the Royal Family. She also said that Prince Harry had “lost” his father Prince Charles in the aftermath of their exit from frontline royal life. In the 6,500-word interview, the Duchess of Sussex compared the breakdown of her own relationship with her father, Thomas Markle, with that of Harry and the Prince of Wales. Speaking of her leaked letter to her father, she said: “Harry said to me, ‘I lost my dad in this process.’ It doesn’t have to be the same for them as it was for me, but that’s his decision.” Commentator Niles Gardiner said on Twitter this morning: “The sheer arrogance of Meghan Markle is breathtaking. “One of the most destructive characters in modern Royal history. “Duchess of Sussex says she has made an ‘active effort’ to forgive her in-laws ... but adds that she is now ‘free to say anything’.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
