She said: “There’s no doubt that pubs across the UK have been raising their prices to try and offset the rising prices they are having to pay and to help claw back revenue they lost during the long lockdowns. “A simple money-saving solution would be to drink at pubs less and take advantage of the nice weather by having drinks outside in your garden. “Of course we still want to go to the pub, though, so another idea is to create specific savings ‘buckets’ or ‘pots' through your banking or savings apps that can be allocated to socialising. “This should help stop you from spending beyond your means, and if you use features that let you round up your spare change then you’d be surprised at how quickly this adds up. “The UK average price of a pint is £4.19 so that is the price to beat in your area. “There will inevitably be a range of prices around you though, so look out for the local pubs that have lower prices than competitors as well as happy hours,” she added.
