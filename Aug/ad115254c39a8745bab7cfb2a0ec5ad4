The third feature from director Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us) unfolds beneath the clear, star-filled skies of southern California. After the mysterious death of their father, stoical, weary OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and his manic, live-wire sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) are struggling to address their grief and maintain the family ranch. But there is something in the air. A vast cloud formation refuses to shift from day to day. Those piercing blue vistas are turning slate grey and full of dread. Jittery, unpredictable horses can sense the danger. Convinced that hostile aliens are lurking in the skies, OJ and Emerald vow to secure conclusive photographic evidence of their existence. The prospect of fame and fortune overrides any thought of running for their lives. But it isn't the smartest move and pushes the film towards do-or-jeopardy. Peele is very good at building suspense and you are constantly wondering where the story is heading. Further complications arise from flashbacks that show a shocking incident in the 1990s when a chimp ran amok during the filming of a television sitcom. The traumatised child star, Jupe (Steven Yuen) now runs a Wild West theme park near OJ and Emerald's ranch. There is a hint of a western alongside elements of blood-spattered horror and science-fiction spectacle. There is way too much plot for Nope to handle and it doesn't always stitch together seamlessly. Though the build-up is edge-ofthe-seat stuff, the grand finale is a bit of an anti-climax.
