 Kate Beckinsale, 49, stunned yesterday as she shared a new bikini picture in view of her 5.4 million Instagram followers. The actress showed off her svelte figure as she lounged on an inflatable swan in the pool. She was joined in the summery pictures by her grey, long-haired cat, who was laying on their own inflatable swan. Kate sported a tiny pink bikini and completed the casual look with a high bun and some oversized shades.
