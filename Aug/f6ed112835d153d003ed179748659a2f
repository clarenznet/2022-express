Sir Rod Stewart, 77, and leggy ex-model Penny Lancaster, 51, enjoyed a luxurious Italian getaway recently while celebrating the Maggie May singer's granddaughter Delilah's 11th birthday. Kimberley, 42, Rod's daughter with actress Alana Stewart, wore a white floral playsuit, a pair of beige leather sandals and a denim jacket slung loosely over her shoulders for the ultimate boho chic look. Little Delilah, shared with her ex-partner Benicio del Toro, flashed an innocent and slightly shy smile at the camera as she posed in her red spotted dress. Meanwhile, Sir Rod and Penny's two sons, 16-year-old Alastair, and 11-year-old Aiden, were also present at the family reunion. Ruby Stewart, Rod's daughter with model Kelly Emberg, was also present, and enthused on Instagram afterwards: "It can be difficult getting us all together, but the incredible @penny.lancaster managed to do it this time."
