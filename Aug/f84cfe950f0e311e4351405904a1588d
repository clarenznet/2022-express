Lisa Faulkner, 50, showed off her enviable figure in a plunging leopard print bikini. She could be seen leaning against the wall, as she posed for the sultry snap, showing off her ample assets. Lisa wore her hair in a bun and accessorised with large black shades, while she enjoyed her holiday with husband John Torode, 57. She captioned the snap in view of her 319,000 Instagram followers: "The sunshine and the sea is the best isnâ€™t it?! "I love how we Brits live for and love our holidays, the whole build up and deciding what to pack only to spend the majority of our time in our favourite bikini and oldest kaftan! "So grateful for every minute. All of my love to you ps bikini is one of @myleeneklass for @nextofficial that I bought and love."
