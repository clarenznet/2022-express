Officials and emergency services are urging people to take precautionary measures when spending time outdoors and avoid barbecues. Among others that warned against disposable barbecues, London Fire Brigade has called for a total ban of the product from retail stores, after the service saw one of the busiest weeks in its history. Retailers are being pressured to remove disposable barbecues from the shelves, with M&S being the first business to completely remove such products from all shops across the country. Meanwhile, the Met Office has warned that “there’s little in the way of rain in the forecast”, after the country saw the driest July in England since 1935. As a result, water companies including Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water are imposing hosepipe bans, in an attempt to avoid droughts or potential rationing of their water supply. For this weekend, the Met Office Fire Severity Index has warned over “Exceptional” fire risk in counties across South and South East England. A study put together by Confused.com shows which areas are most fire-prone in the country, based on the number of incidents the Fire and Rescue Services responded to, per 100,000 residents.
