Someone Like You singer Adele, 34, has put on a breathtaking display while posing for the cover of the October 2022 issue of ELLE UK in a series of figure-flaunting outfits. The British megastar flaunted her new gym-honed figure as she went topless under a chic winter coat, before showing off her off-duty style in a skintight blue long sleeved top, which she paired with jeans for the fashion-forward photoshoot. However, it wasn’t just Adele’s outfit choices that were at the centre of her latest magazine appearance, as she also broke her silence on plenty of rumours that have been circulating about her romance with boyfriend Rich Paul, and the backlash over her Las Vegas tour cancellation. Adele told the publication that she pulled out of the dates because: “There was just no soul in it. The stage setup wasn’t right. “It was very disconnected from me and my band, and it lacked intimacy. And maybe I tried too hard to give it those things in such a controlled environment,” she admitted. The Rumour Has It hitmaker went on to deny rumours she’s engaged to her beau Rich Paul, after being spotted with a huge diamond ring. After gushing about her “obsession” with Rich, Adele quipped: “I’m not engaged. I just love high-end jewellery, boy!” The October issue of ELLE UK is on sale from 01 September
