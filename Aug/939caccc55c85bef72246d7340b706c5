Former Manchester United footballer David Beckham, 47, has proven that he’s just like any other dad, as he owned up to “embarrassing” his and wife Victoria Beckham’s daughter Harper, 11.  The father-daughter duo were enjoying a night out at The Weeknd’s tour in Miami when David attempted to show off his singing voice as Abel Tesfaye, 32, belted out his hit, Out of Time, on stage.  However, David got the timing a bit wrong, as he started singing the lyrics ahead of the music.  Admitting to his blunder in view of his 74.9 million Instagram followers, alongside a video of him singing in the audience with Harper, David wrote: “Embarrassing dad moment timing was a little off but we got there in the end and I made HarperSeven laugh.  “@theweeknd WOW what a show #Miami THAT SMILE.”  Harper could be seen chuckling at her dad’s attempts to sing along to The Weeknd’s track, before grinning from ear to ear while watching the rest of the concert.  Fans loved the exchange between the duo, with leili_bayatani declaring: "You are best dad." Instagram user nicola.howson quipped: "Stop pretending it’s all for Harper."
