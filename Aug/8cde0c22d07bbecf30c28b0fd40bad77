She is said to have searched online for the footballer's "worth", jurors heard yesterday. The woman told Chester Crown Court: "He's headlines and stuff. Obviously I'm going to Google him." She alleges Mendy, 28, raped her in the cinema room of his Â£4.8million mansion in Prestbury, Cheshire, in July 2021. Asked if she would be seeking compensation, she added "no, and I haven't done". Mendy denies eight rapes, one attempted rape, and sexual assault, against seven women. Co-accused Louis Saha Matturie, 41, of Manchester, denies eight rapes and four sex assaults. Both insist any sex was consensual. The trial continues.
