The Prime Minister stressed official support was still being distributed but he said more would be needed with energy bills predicted to hit nearly £5,300 by the spring. Mr Johnson said whoever is in Downing Street would be "making sure there is extra cash to help people". He added: "I think it is crucial to understand that, first of all, we realised for a long time that things were going to be tough and that's why we put in place a lot of measures already." "The money has started to come through. I think it is very important for people to understand, most people have not yet received the help the Government has already allocated, so over the course of the next couple of months you will see about eight million households get another £326, you will see everybody in October get help with the energy support scheme." Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who was visiting Broughton Airbus plant in North Wales with Mr Johnson, insisted the next prime minister would "hit the ground running" as the Treasury is looking at "all the options" so decisions can be taken swiftly. He said: "My message to families today is: we will have those options ready to go." "I met with the industry to look at what more we can do with the industry on direct debit, on prepayment meters, all the things that families are worried about." But Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said she believed energy prices would be "nothing near" the dismal forecasts made by the gas and electricity industry's analysts. Consultants Auxilione expects the £1,971 price cap to hit £3,628 in October, then £4,538 in January and peak at £5,277 in April.
