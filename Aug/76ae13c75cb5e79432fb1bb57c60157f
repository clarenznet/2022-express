China carried out anti-submarine attack simulations and sea-raid operations despite stating that military exercises were due to finish on Sunday. Beijing also defended shelving talks with the US amid fury in China over a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives. It said communication “requires sincerity”. China has said its military would now conduct “regular” drills. Taiwan demanded Beijing “pull back from the edge” and put its military on alert after 21 Chinese fighter planes entered its airspace. It is also monitoring ships and drones.
