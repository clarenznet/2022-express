Catherine Deneuve, 78, showed age is just a number as she posed for snaps prior to accepting her Lifetime Achievement Award at the Venice International Film Festival this evening. The French actress cut a casual figure in smart black trousers and an oversized purple shirt. She showed off her flawless complexion with her light makeup palette and accessorised with gold hoop earrings and a striped colourful body bag. Catherine styled her signature blonde tresses in loose waves as she smiled for the cameras. The Hollywood actress has had a hugely successful career, even being nominated for a BAFTA and an Oscar, as well as being the recipient of several CÃ©sar Awards.
