The incident occurred on Saturday in Liverpool, as the boy went to visit a friend's house. The young victim was set upon by a dog in Wellesbourne Place, Norris Green, according to reports. A neighbour came to the rescue of the boy and managed to pull the dog off him. Despite the heroic efforts of his rescuer, the boy suffered serious injuries and was rushed to hospital. He remains in a serious but stable condition. The dog was seized by police who also arrested a 31-year-old woman in connection with the attack. Detective Inspector Chris Hawitt, said: “This incident has left a young child with serious injuries to his face and head, and will have been an extremely distressing incident for all who witnessed it. "I would like to commend the neighbour whose quick thinking and selfless swift actions have probably saved the life of this young boy, who has suffered life changing injuries. “Our enquiries into the full circumstances of the incident are ongoing, and we have seized the dog for the safety of the community and to establish its breed. "We have a dedicated sergeant who reviews all cases concerning dangerous dogs, and are keen to speak to any witnesses who may have seen the incident or this dog on previous occasions. "I want to emphasise that dog owners need to be mindful of their dogs' behaviour at all times , particularly where young children may be around the dog. "And if owners take their dogs into public spaces they should keep their pet on a lead and muzzled if it is liable to be aggressive.”
