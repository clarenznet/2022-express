The Whiter Shade of Pale singer and co-writer gave his music collection to nephew Bradley Gould after his wife Francoise picked out her favourites. His bequest read: "I give all my physical collection of records, CDs and videos to my nephew Bradley provided that if Francoise shall have survived me then I would want her to be able to select anything from them." Brooker gave his fishing gear to Ellis Gould, another nephew. Some is being sold by Thomas Turner Fishing Antiques. The firm's John Stephenson said: "From what I can see going through the collection, he collected what he liked and he rated it all the same. It was an odd collection - every bag I opened I thought: 'Wow, that's nice!'" The rest of his property went to his trustees, his wife - they marked 50 years of marriage in 2018 - his sister Angela Gould and his lawyers. Brooker, pictured left in 2019, founded the band in 1966 with friend Keith Reid and later toured with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr. He died from cancer at his Surrey home in February, aged 76.
