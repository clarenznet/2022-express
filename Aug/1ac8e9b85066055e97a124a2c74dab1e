Escape To The Chateau fans have taken to Instagram to express their disbelief at how "grown up" the two Strawbridge children, Dorothy and Arthur, look. It comes as the show's official Instagram shared snaps with their 241,000 followers after the family enjoyed a visit to Disneyland in Paris with friends from the UK. Angel shared a selfie with her son Arthur, nine, as she donned a pair of Minnie Mouse ears. The caption read: "Last week, the Strawbridges took a very magical trip... "'A couple of hours on the train and we found ourselves in a complete wonderland. There was Mickey and Minnie, oodles of Princesses, face painting and glitter, big rides and littles rides, and very dear friends from the UK including my gorgeous goddaughter. We had a ball!'" Instagram user leenamichaelau wrote: "You all look fabulous and how have the kids grown, can't believe it." As belleandbeaubabyknits commented: "Gosh, how theyâ€™ve grown up since the last series!"
