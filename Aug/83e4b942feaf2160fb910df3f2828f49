The Frenchman produced a stellar display on Sunday as the Magpies drew 3-3 with Premier League champions Manchester City at St James’ Park   The 25-year-old tormented the City backline and set-up two of his side’s goals as the north east giants continued their unbeaten start to the season. And a big-money move to Old Trafford could now be on the cards. The Red Devils have already landed Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen this summer after a dismal campaign last time around. And they are also chasing Ajax forward Antony and PSV attacker Cody Gakpo. United endured a miserable start to the new Premier League season as they were defeated 2-1 at home to Brighton before being humbled 4-0 at Brentford. But on Monday night they finally got their campaign up and running as they stunned Liverpool 2-1 at Old Trafford. And club chiefs will be hoping for more good news in the transfer market. Chelsea, meanwhile, are confident of signing Everton starlet Anthony Gordon before the end of the week and are also targeting AC Milan forward Rafael Leao, according to the Times.
