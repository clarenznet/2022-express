Romeo Beckham has got tongues wagging with his new “family” photo on Instagram. The 19-year-old posted a snap of himself with mum Victoria, 48, dad David, 47, sister Harper, 11, and brother Cruz, 17 - who was wearing a Spice Girls t-shirt. He captioned the post “Family,” alongside a white love heart, before tagging two friends and congratulating them - presumably for opening the venue the famous family were inside. But his followers couldn’t help but notice one family member was absent - eldest son Brooklyn, 23. Brooklyn, who recently married Nicola Peltz, 27, has been spending a lot of time overseas with his new wife, and Romeo’s followers noticed. Heatherames12 asked: “Why is brooklyn never w you guys anymore”. Another follower enquired: “Brooklyn?” Brooklyn and Nicola were recently forced to quell rumours of a rift between them and Victoria, insisting they all “get along”.
