Although Christmas is still months away, GREAT! clearly thinks people will want to get in the mood early this year with the channel officially arriving on September 8. The firm says it will broadcast films 24 hours a day and show movies such as A Christmas Melody starring Mariah Carey. Other things confirmed are Whoopi Goldberg in the family film Call Me Claus, Liam Neeson, Pierce Brosnan and Suranne Jones in A Christmas Star, and Lesley Manville, John Hannah and Sylvester McCoy in The Christmas Candle. Viewers are also being promised exclusive channel premieres such as The Mistletoe Promise, A Taste of Christmas, Christmas Cupcakes, Welcome to Christmas and many more. If you fancy tuning in, you'll find the service on Freeview 52, Sky 319, Virgin 424, and Freesat 303 from next month and it's free to watch.
