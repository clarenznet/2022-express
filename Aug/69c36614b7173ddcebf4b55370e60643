Jennifer Lawrence, 32, is known for her enviable Hollywood looks and Oscar-nominated performances. The Hollywood star has had a successful career already spanning over a decade, with her fashion choices always catching eyes. This can be said for the red carpet gown at 2011's 83rd Annual Academy Awards. Jennifer, who recently gave birth to her first child with husband Cooke Maroney, stunned in a simplistic figure-hugging red dress, showing off her svelte figure. She styled her signature blonde tresses in a soft curl, and accessorised with a sparkly gold clutch bag. You can watch Jennifer Lawrence this evening in Red Sparrow at 10pm on Channel 4
