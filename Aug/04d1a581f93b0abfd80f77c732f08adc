Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said causing death by dangerous cycling will go before MPs this autumn. It means cyclists who take pedestrians' lives could now be sent to jail for longer than the current two-year maximum.  Mr Shapps said victims' families had "waited too long for this straightforward measure". Reckless cyclists are currently covered by the Offences Against The Person Act 1861 - designed to prosecute "wanton or furious driving" of horsedrawn carriages. On June 28 the maximum sentence for motorists who cause death by dangerous driving went up from 14 years to life.
