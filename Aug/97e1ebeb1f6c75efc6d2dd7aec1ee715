The 23-time Grand Slam winner announced three weeks ago that she will be “evolving away” from tennis after a 25-year career. After beating world No.80 Danka Kovinic 6-3 6-3, fellow legend Billie Jean King paid tribute to her in the Arthur Ashe Stadium while there was a video montage narrated by Oprah Winfrey. And the capacity crowd held up blue and white cards with the words: We Love You Serena. It was all planned in case the American superstar lost but she will return play No.2 seed Anett Kontaveit on Wednesday night. She will be guaranteed more amazing support in her swansong.
