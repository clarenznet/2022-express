In his version of events, engineer Gustave Eiffel (Romain Duris) designed the iconic tower as a monument to the great love of his life. Flashbacks fill in the details of his doomed, long ago romance with the captivating Adrienne (Sex Education star Emma Mackey). Decades later, they meet again. Now, she is married to prominent journalist Antoine (Pierre Deladonchamps) who is a supporter of Eiffel and the construction of the tower. It is a predictably messy business as, despite the guilt of betraying her husband, Gustave and Adrienne find their love is stronger second time around. Visually, the film is sleek and inviting with memorable moments along the misty banks of the Seine, and among the walkways and dizzying heights of the unfinished construction. It's the story that keeps dragging everything back down to earth. Duris brings a twinkle of mischief to the role of the grand designer but doesn't really strike sparks with the rather bland Mackey. The result is perfectly watchable but it's hard to believe a word of it.
