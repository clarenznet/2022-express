Some 3,683 migrants travelled on 90 small boats last month, with journeys taking place on 20 days of 31, official figures reveal. Yesterday morning several young children were among the dozens of people brought ashore on Border Force catamaran Typhoon.  The group, many wrapped in blankets, later left the port in Ramsgate, Kent, on a double decker bus. They were among around 200 arriving yesterday. Meanwhile, it was reported Home Secretary Priti Patel wants to make another multi-million pound deal with France to help improve its beach patrols and surveillance equipment. Britain has already provided more than Â£80million over the last few years to boost efforts across the Channel. But since Ms Patel unveiled plans to send migrants to Rwanda as a deterrent back in April, 11,131 more people have made the journey in small vessels or dinghies.  On Saturday, 460 crossed some of the world's busiest shipping lanes in 12 boats - as the daily figure topped 400 for the sixth time this year. No arrivals were reported on Sunday. April 13, when 651 hit our shores, still holds the daily record for 2022. The highest monthly figure on record since 2018 is November 2021 with 6,971 crossings.
