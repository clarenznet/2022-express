Daniil Medvedev gained his “revenge” on his American opponent as he began his bid to become the first man to defend his US Open title since Roger Federer in 2008. The world No.1 revealed Stefan Kozlov was “unbeatable” in the juniors. But in the opening match in the Arthur Ashe Stadium today, the Russian romped to victory 6-2 6-4 6-0. Medvedev won the final eight games from 4-4 in the second set as the world No.111 Kozlov struggled in the heat. It was a different story in the past as Kozlov, who is of Russian descent, had a brilliant junior career and reached two junior Grand Slam finals. Medvedev said:  “I remember in the juniors it was impossible to beat him even though he was two years younger. He was unbeatable. I was happy to get my revenge today.” JUST IN: Murray outlines reasons for US Open success after tough conditions  Medvedev sent down 10 aces and broke the Kozlov serve eight times in his first Grand Slam match since the French Open after he was banned at Wimbledon.
