As Liz is an advocate of small government, she should start wielding the axe now, starting with a streamlined Cabinet, which under Boris Johnson was standing room only. I can't believe we really need 43 government departments and 413 agencies, which include the now superfluous ministries for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus those for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Levelling Up and Business.

The vastness of the universe and the secrets of space don't matter an iota if we can't heat our homes or put food on the table. It is very disturbing to read that around 20 per cent of young children do not own a book, says Stephanie Clarke, from Reading, Berkshire.
