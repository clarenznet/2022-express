Judges are to receive revised directions that will help them lock up the worst abusers for longer. The Sentencing Council advisory body has proposed a “very high culpability” threshold which, if applied, would allow abusive fathers and mothers to be jailed for 14 years. Judges would be told to consider if multiple “high culpability” acts – such as prolonged cruelty, gratuitous degradation, using weapons and failing to protect a child – make them liable for tougher penalties. In 2020, some 330 people were sentenced for crimes of cruelty to children – down from a peak of 740 recorded in 2015. Sentencing Council data revealed that only a fifth of offenders were sent to prison. The total of parents jailed for causing or letting a child die and causing or letting one suffer serious harm plummeted to eight last year. The Sentencing Council revealed: “In 2019 and 2020, all offenders sentenced for causing or allowing a child to die received immediate custody." “Half of the offenders sentenced for causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm received immediate custody.” The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which came into force in June, stated that offenders who premeditate the killing of children can be given whole life imprisonment orders. Clare Kelly, NSPCC associate head of policy, said: “It’s crucial judges have the proper powers and guidance to hand down sentences which reflect the seriousness of abuse. Sentencing isonly part of the picture. It is vital that we have a child protection system that has the resources to intervene early.”
