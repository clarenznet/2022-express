The grim find sparked a huge police presence in the area on Saturday, who have since launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. Officers sealed off a section of the Alexandra Road site, which is run by Sandwell Council. Several blue tents were subsequently erected at the burial ground following the harrowing find. A forensic team continued to work at the site over the Bank Holiday weekend. Images shared from the scene show officers surrounding the three forensic tents, which had been erected near the yellow skip where the remains were discovered.  A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: "We're investigating after human remains were found in a skip at Tipton Cemetery, Alexandra Road, on Saturday evening (August 27). "The area has been cordoned off for further searches to be carried out. "They will undergo forensic and archaeological analysis. There is no information linking this discovery to a criminal investigation at this stage." Sandwell Council would not comment on the police activity but told BirminghamLive the cemetery was "open as usual today".  It comes after a similar incident happened in Walsall - also in the West Midlands - in June. Human remains were found at a local nature reserve in the area. It was discovered by police near Cuckoo's Nook in Sutton Road on Saturday, June 4. The police investigation lasted around two weeks but officers were unable to identify the deceased.  Police previously said the discovery is being treated as unexplained. At the time, a spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: "The scene has been closed and we are still working to identify the deceased." The death was referred to the coroner.
