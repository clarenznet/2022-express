The Duchess of Cambridge, 40, is number one in Tatler's best-dressed list for 2022. Royal commentator Richard Eden commented on the Duchess of Sussex not making the top 10, questioning if it was a "bit harsh". Mr Eden tweeted: "Bit harsh? Duchess of Cambridge is Number One in @tatlermagazine's Best Dressed list for 2022 while Duchess of Sussex fails to make top ten." Tatler described future queen Kate's style as "sovereign superstar". It added: "Everything should be perfectly tailored, embracing current catwalk trends through a lens of appropriate dress lengths and classic silhouettes."
