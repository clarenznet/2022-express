The fire reportedly started from a balcony on a three and six-storey block on Heathstan Road and has expanded to other flats of the building. About 30 residents were evacuated from the building after the fire broke out. The cause of the fire is still unknown. A baby with smoke inhalation has been taken to the hospital as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) was called to respond to the blaze at 2.45pm. The service urges nearby residents to keep their doors and windows shut due to the large amount of smoke. In a statement, LFB said: "Firefighters are tackling the fire on a second-floor balcony of the block. "Around 30 people left the building before the Brigade arrived." Station Commander Matt Brown, who is at the scene, said: "Firefighters are working hard in hot conditions to tackle this blaze, which started on a second floor balcony. "It has also affected a third floor balcony and the third floor flat roof. "One of our 32m ladders is at the scene to assist firefighting operations.  "Residents in the area are advised to close their doors and windows due to the smoke. "While there are no current road closures, we would ask motorists to please avoid the area where possible as there are a large amount of vehicles at the scene." Fire crews from Park Royal, Chiswick, Fulham, Willesden, Richmond, Hammersmith and surrounding fire stations are at the scene. In a Twitter update earlier, LFB had said: "Eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters have been called to reports of a fire on Heathstan Road in #ShepherdsBush."
