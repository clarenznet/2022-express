It features fresh interviews with French detectives and witnesses and explores the many conspiracy theories surrounding the tragedy. Royal experts are urging Princes William and Harry not to watch it. In one poignant moment, Martine Monteil - former head of the elite Brigade Criminelle police unit - recalls how she found pearls at the crash scene that had been ripped from Diana's neck by the force of the high-speed impact. And a former detective who sat by the bedside of Diana's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones as he was recovering from horrific injuries, recalls how he spoke of her last words. Aides have confirmed William and Harry were neither consulted nor shown a preview of the four-part series. Programme makers say it is told as a "gripping and forensic police procedural" and claim it explores "how powerful individuals, the press and internet created and fuelled conspiracy theories that overwhelmed facts and called into question the very nature of truth". The show also rehashes some of the wilder theories about the tragedy, flashing on screen a string of disturbing internet messages such as: "The British elite know damn well it was murder." Royal author Margaret Holder condemned the "sensationalism" and said the series "is unlikely to be welcomed by Princes William and Harry". She said it shows an "uncaring attitude to the princes and all the families involved". "In the last decade or so, social media has provided new platforms for all manner of conspiracy theorists."
