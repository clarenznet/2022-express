According to National Highways, two lanes are closed on the eastbound stretch of the motorway between junctions J25 and J26. On their website, National Highways said the closures are due to an accident involving an overturned vehicle. The event is expected to clear between 9.30am and 9.45am, with normal traffic conditions expected at the same time. It comes ahead of essential maintenance works on a section of the M62 Westbound slip road at Junction 6. The road will be closed with a diversion viaÂ  Roby Road, Tarbock Road, Cronton Road and vice versa. On Wednesday, the M62 westbound, junction 25 to junction 24, will see a lane closure for survey works. The works last from 8pm on August 17 to 6am on August 18, and from 8pm the same day 6am on August 19pm. It also comes after a car fire on the M62 at Birchwood, Warrington on Friday afternoon. The incident took place at 1:51pm on the M62 J11 Westbound. Fire crews from Birchwood and Warrington attended at the scene as one lane of four was closed while firefighters extinguished the car fire. The fire is believed to have started due to an engine fault.
