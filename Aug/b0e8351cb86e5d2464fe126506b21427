Manchester United's pursuit of Frenkie de Jong - as expected - is going to head down to the club with the Red Devils preparing to restart negotiations. United had reached an agreement on a fee with Barcelona some weeks ago but that has since expired after De Jong refused to entertain leaving the La Liga giants. However, United are going back in for the Dutchman as Erik ten Hag looks to strengthen his team before the window shuts on September 1. Along with De Jong, the likes of Antony, Cody Gakpo, Casemiro and a new right-back and goalkeeper could come through the doors at Old Trafford. United are not the only club in the Premier League busy working on transfers, with the likes of Tottenham and Newcastle still keen to add to the business they've already done. The former has already made seven signings so far but Antonio Conte is not fully satisfied and still wants a creative midfielder. Nicolo Zaniolo is his No 1 target, and though the Italian is in talks to extend his contract at Roma, Jose Mourinho has admitted the midfielder could still leave. Atalanta's Ruslan Malinovskyi has been identified as an alternative should a move for Zaniolo fail to come to fruition. Newcastle, meanwhile, are close to sealing a deal for Joao Pedro from Watford and are eyeing a Â£10million move for Maxi Gomez. Other clubs in the Premier League such as Chelsea and Arsenal are also expected to welcome one more fresh face before the window shuts.
