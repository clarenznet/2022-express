The former Norland nanny – the elite agency that works with the Royal Family – now trains dogs to do circus tricks. Deborah set up The Incredibly Clever Canine Circus while working as a dog behaviour specialist at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.  Her favourite clients are children who want to teach their pooches how to perform. “Some of our best trainers are kids,” said Deborah, 51, who was a nanny for 15 years. “It’s the adults that can be hard to work with because they say things like, ‘my dog won’t’ or ‘my dog can’t’ before they’ve even tried.” Deborah, who has studied human psychology and animal behaviour at university, teaches owners how to get their pets to perform agility skills and tricks such as jumping through hoops, sitting on bicycles or unrolling ayoga mat using their noses. She said: “Dogs process information in a similar way to young humans. Most dogs get to the stage of understanding of a two-and-a-half-year-old child, which happens to be my favourite age group.” Deborah, who lives in Surrey, takes her circus to events and festivals. She is at Camp Good Life in Wales next month.
