Based on new data, the UK comes in third place in terms of countries that have seen the biggest increase in the number of electrified vehicles on the road. The UK has seen a year-on-year change of more than 312,000 from 433,000 EVs in 2020 rising to almost 746,000 in 2021. This falls below Germany which saw an increase of 681,000 EVs and China which saw an extra 3.3 million EVs on the road between 2020 and 2021. However, the UK’s public charging infrastructure hasn’t kept pace with the number of EVs on the road in the past year, according to carwow. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of EVs per charging point increased by 7.3, which is the seventh highest increase in the world. With the 2030 sales ban of petrol and diesel vehicles quickly approaching, many industry experts are calling for more to be done to promote electric vehicles as a suitable replacement.

He said: “China has been leading the way in many regards, installing more new charging points (340k) and selling more EVs and PHEVs (3.3 million) in 2021 compared to 2020 than any other country. “With a population roughly one-twentieth the size of China’s, the UK is holding its own though. “Out of 44 countries, the UK’s stock of EVs increased by the third-highest figure (+312k) between 2020 and 2021.

Behind this data, however, lie wider geopolitical and economic considerations.” In the UK, 460 electric vehicles were sold per 100,000 of the population in 2021. While this does rank in the top 15 per capita in the data, it is still a long way off from countries like Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg. Around 24 percent of people are still hesitant when it comes to buying an electric vehicle. The main reason cited for the lack of confidence is that there aren't enough public charging stations for them to make the switch. Mr Griffiths continued, saying: “The UK’s relatively small geographical size, meanwhile, means implementing a comprehensive charge point infrastructure is far less of a challenge than it is in countries that take days, rather than hours, to cross by car. “Yet the UK Government recently withdrew the Plug-in Car Grant after putting £1.4billion of taxpayer money towards the cost of almost half a million new EVs. “The Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme, which provided grants to help homeowners get private chargers installed, also recently ended. “It remains to be seen if the removal of these incentives will have an impact on EV uptake.” The UK Government expects around 300,000 public chargers as a minimum by 2030. The £950million rapid charging fund will support the rollout of at least 6,000 high-powered chargepoints across England’s motorways and major A-roads by 2035. A further £500million will be available to local authorities to “find innovative ways” to increase local chargepoint coverage.
