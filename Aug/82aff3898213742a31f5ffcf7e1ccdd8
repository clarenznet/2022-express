Jobs as sommeliers at high-end restaurants introduced their taste buds to the complexities of wine. The men set their sights on representing their home country at the World Wine Tasting Championships in Burgundy. You can't help but admire their infectious enthusiasm as they prepare for an elite competition in which you need to be able to taste the difference between a Malbec and Merlot, identify the country of its origin and the year in which it was produced. Wine expert Jancis Robinson is among those cheering them on as they strive to prove they deserve a place at the top table. This entertaining documentary follows the rocky road to Burgundy and allows us to become better acquainted with Pardon, Marlvin, Tinashe and Joseph, the lives they left behind and their hopes for a brighter future. The subject matter initially suggests a kind of Cool Runnings with plonk - but Blind Ambition soon builds into a full-bodied feel-good film.
