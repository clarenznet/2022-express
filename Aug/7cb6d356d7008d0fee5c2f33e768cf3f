Jennifer Lawrence, 31, stunned in snaps as she wore a jaw-dropping brown dress, strutting down a cobbled street as she walked away from a meeting with French film director, Leos Carax on Tuesday. The actress looked prepared for the sun as she dressed for the warm weather. The filmstar took a stroll and held up her dark shades as she attempted to shield her eyes from the sun. The Hunger Games actress stunned in a long brown summer dress with dark sandals teamed with a black bag while out and about in the Big Apple. She accessorised her outfit with two silver necklaces to finish her look. The new mum wore her long blonde tresses over her right shoulder.
