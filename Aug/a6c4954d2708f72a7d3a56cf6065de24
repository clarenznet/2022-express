The 60-year-old soap star looked incredible in the stylish two-piece as the couple was pictured exiting Islington Town Hall while holding hands. Michelle accessorised her attire with a floral garland atop her head while her husband mirrored her style in a white jacket which he wore over a black shirt and trousers. The couple left their wedding ceremony in style as they were seen in a classic white convertible that had been decorated in ribbon. Michelle and Mike began dating in late 2012, after they were set up by Michelleâ€™s niece, who is said to have worked for Mike at a retail store. Michelle's former co-star Adam Woodyatt, who played Cindy's ex-husband on EastEnders, was also in attendance but looked fairly casual in blue trousers and a striped shirt.
