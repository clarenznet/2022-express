Pretty Woman actor Richard Gere, 72, looked like the perfect gentleman as he stepped out with his beloved wife, Alejandra Silva, 39.  The blonde beauty stole the show on the red carpet at the Starlite Porcelanosa gala in Marbella, Spain, as she put on a jaw-dropping display in an ethereal yellow dress, featuring a white floral pattern.  The couple looked closer than ever at the star-studded event, as Richard planted a kiss on Alejandraâ€™s cheek in a tender exchange.  Dapper Richard, who channelled Hollywood glamour in a classic black tuxedo, wrapped his arms around his wife, as she gazed at him lovingly in front of the cameras.  Richard and Alejandra have returned to the spotlight after taking a sun soaked break on a family holiday to Ibiza with their two young sons. The An Officer and a Gentleman actor previously insisted he has no issues with being an older father.
