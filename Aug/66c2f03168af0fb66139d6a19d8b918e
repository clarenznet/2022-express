The 50-year-old Property Ladder presenter revealed yesterday she has breast cancer. Now she has posted a poignant picture of herself on Instagram - with a pixie cut, courtesy of her boys, Billy, 18, Charlie, 16, Rafferty, 14, and Laurie, 12. She has donated the locks to the Little Princess Trust which provides free real hair wigs to children and young people who have lost their own through cancer. Sarah captioned her photo: "A little pile of not very good condition hair on its way to @officiallittleprincesstrust - my trainee hairdressers cut off my hair on Friday night - getting one step ahead after first chemo treatment for breast cancer on Friday - the exclusive club you'd rather not be a member of!" The post has attracted more than 30,000 likes from all over the world. Sarah, who is married to artist Graham Swift, lost her 39-year-old mother Ann to breast cancer when she was 10. The property expert said she had been expecting the diagnosis for 40 years but felt "lucky" because she lives in a family "where we all talk". Thanking fans for their messages of support, Sarah apologised for missing CarFest in Hampshire at the weekend, where her children's band, Entitled Sons, performed. She posted on Twitter: "Thanks so much for your kind comments after not being at CarFest supporting my sons - first session of chemo for breast cancer on Friday kept me away - not much else would!" Sarah is to carry on working during her treatment, with plans for a TV series and a book later this year.
