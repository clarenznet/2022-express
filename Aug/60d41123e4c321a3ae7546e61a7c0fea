Geri Horner, 49, has faced backlash after posing in a photo of herself alongside Conservative minister Nadine Dorries. The culture secretary shared the snap in full view of her 152,600 followers on Sunday as the two attended the women’s Euro 2022 final between England and Germany. She captioned the post: “Girl power radiating from Wembley tonight.” Fans were furious that Geri would pose with Nadine after the politician's various stances on certain social issues. Many fans specifically pointed out Dorries’ history of voting against gay marriage and “only recently demonising the trans community”. Twitter user, @notboysean tweeted: "Geri really does do everything she can to p*** on her legacy. Madness."

It was for her work championing children, young people and women’s rights in June.  READ MORE...
