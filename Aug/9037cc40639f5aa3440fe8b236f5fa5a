Hosepipe bans, a last resort for British water firms, will come into effect this week. Severe dry weather and high temperatures have forced companies to take drastic action, with demand rising well above the summer average. Two firms have announced they will require their customers to conserve water, with bans covering parts of southern England. Severe hot weather experienced over July primarily settled in the south, where regions saw the mercury reach 40C and above. While temperatures have reverted to their usual mid-20C averages in the last few weeks, rainfall remains scarce. The country is now on the verge of drought, and two firms, Southern Water and South East Water have responded with hosepipe bans.
