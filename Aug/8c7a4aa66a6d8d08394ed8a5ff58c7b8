Nicole Scherzinger, 44, put on a stunning display in LA last night, as she went for dinner with Andrew Lloyd Webber, 77. The Pussycat Dolls star, who was originally tipped to star in the Broadway version of Andrew’s Cats musical, looked sensational in a glittering champagne-coloured dress. The one-shouldered gown featured a daring thigh high slit, and Nicole paired the number with a pair of gold sandals. She was seen clutching the hand of 77-year-old Andrew, who looked casual in black trousers, a white t-shirt and black jacket. Nicole’s ex Lewis Hamilton, who she dated from 2008 to 2015, recently opened up about his reluctance to talk about his relationships publicly. "I learned the hard way, I learned the hard way,” he told Vanity Fair. "I haven’t talked about it much. I’m really just super focused on work. "I’ve realised that I can’t do two things or three things at once, I’ve got to focus on one. He continued: "I really wanted to go through a growth process of getting myself to a point where I’m happy on my own, comfortable in my space. "So that if I ever do meet someone, it’s an addition, rather than 'I need you in my life'," he concluded.
