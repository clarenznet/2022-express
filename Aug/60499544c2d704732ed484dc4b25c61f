There are now under two weeks left of the summer transfer window and we could be about to enter the most frenetic and unpredictable period of the market as we build up towards deadline day. Premier League clubs have already splashed out hundreds of millions of pounds on new signings - but expect that figure to grow in the coming days. Manchester United fans were finally given something to cheer as they reached an agreement for Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro earlier this week. But they still want much more, and links to Ajax winger Antony, PSV Eindhoven star Conor Gakpo and Brighton talent Moises Caicedo continue to grow. Meanwhile, Chelsea also still want at least one or two new faces, and talk linking them with Leicester's Wesley Fofana and Harry Maguire of United will not go away. Do not be surprised to see movement in the coming hours. And with Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, Newcastle and Leeds among others still eyeing additions to their squads, strap yourselves in because this summer transfer window is far from over yet.
