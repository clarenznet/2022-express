Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle will return to the UK next month for a surprise trip. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are “delighted” to visit the prince’s home country and work with “charities close to their hearts,” according to a spokesperson for the couple. They will first head to Manchester for The One Young World Manchester Summit, before travelling to Germany to attend the Invictus Games Düsseldorf One Year To Go ceremony. Then they will return to the UK for the WellChild Awards 2022 in London. It will mark their first return to the UK since they visited for Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee in June.Meghan and Harry crossed the pond to attend events during the special four-day weekend in celebration of the monarch’s historic 70-year reign.In order to keep a low profile, the couple only attended two public events — the Trooping the Colour parade, and the national service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral.Their visit was brief, with the Duke and Duchess jetting back to the US before the festivities came to an end.

However, one royal commentator has argued the memoir is an opportunity for the Sussexes to “press the reset button” on their so-called feud with the House of Windsor.Tom Sykes, The Daily Beast’s royal correspondent, appeared on last week’s episode of Royally Us to discuss the upcoming memoir with hosts Christine Ross and Christina Garibaldi.He said: “I really wonder whether this kind of narrative that has gained a bit of ground — that it’s going to be all about sticking machetes in the backs of the royals and doing one over on his father — I just really doubt that is going to be the case.“I think that in the Oprah interview they kind of did that, and the Apple documentary they kind of did that.

"I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story — the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned — I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think."He continued, "I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful." Harry’s book was initially expected to be published in autumn this year, but it has now been said that it is due to be released around the festive season.As a source told The Sun last month: “The manuscript has been finished and gone through all of the legal processes. It’s done and out of Harry’s hands.“The publishing date has been pushed back once but it is on track for the end of the year.”
