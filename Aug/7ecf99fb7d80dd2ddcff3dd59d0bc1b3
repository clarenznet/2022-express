Following the death of Kevin Brooks, who was buried in May 2021 at St James' Church in Newchapel, Staffordshire, his family requested a blue pearl granite memorial with gold lettered wording, including "dad". However, the church rejected the request.  Church officials objected to the blue pearl granite with the gold lettering, and they also wanted "father" instead of "dad," reports StokeonTrentLive. The case was taken to the Church of England's Consistory Court. Now Judge Dr Anthony Verduyn has overruled the initial decision of The Reverend Janet Arnold and her parochial church council. The Brooks family successfully argued that the word "Dad" was on other gravestones within the churchyard and that there are identical memorials to their preferred choice. Dr Verduyn ruled: "In this case, the irregular shape of the memorial appears elsewhere and nearby, and it could be harsh to deny the erection of a similar stone. "Like considerations apply to its colour, lettering and the reference to 'Dad'. "It seems to me, and I find that, the proposed memorial would not jar visually or in sentiment in this graveyard and I accordingly grant the permission." It comes as human remains were found at a graveyard last week, sparking a police investigation. They were found in a skip at Tipton Cemetery in the West Midlands. Several blue tents were erected at the burial ground following the grim discovery. Police sealed off a section of the Alexandra Road site, which is run by Sandwell Council, on Saturday, August 27. A West Midlands Police spokesman said at the time: "We're investigating after human remains were found in a skip at Tipton Cemetery, Alexandra Road, on Saturday evening (August 27). The area has been cordoned off for further searches to be carried out. "They will undergo forensic and archaeological analysis. There is no information linking this discovery to a criminal investigation at this stage."
