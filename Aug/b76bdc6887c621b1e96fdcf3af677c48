Liverpool head coach Jurgen Klopp has aimed a dig at Bournemouth over their sacking of boss Scott Parker on Tuesday. The Reds' 9-0 thumping of the Cherries on Saturday proved to be Parker's final match in charge. Parker was dismissed by Bournemouth on Tuesday morning, with a brief statement appearing to suggest that there was a divide between his aims and the club's board. The former England international has been criticial of some of the transfer activity this summer. "Some clubs are owned by countries but others have a structure like us and maybe Arsenal. Then three teams who came up, Nottingham Forest are spending, Fulham is and I can't remember Bournemouth doing a lot, which is difficult for a coach. I felt for Scott."

Our search for a new head coach will begin immediately.” "And probably not surprised so much, in the sense of the levels we're playing against here and the quality is just far greater than what we have in this present moment in time at our disposal. While of course it's not me making any excuse because there's some goals in that game that were of our own doing, in terms of the set-play goals were really poor, and we can do something about that. “But at this present moment in time I feel sorry for the fans, I feel sorry for the players, to be honest with you, because at the moment we are just a bit underequipped at this level from where we have come from."
