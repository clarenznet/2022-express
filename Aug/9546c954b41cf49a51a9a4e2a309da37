The company said its two rivals copied its mRNA technology, covered by patents filed between 2010 and 2016.  Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is the genetic script that carries DNA instructions to each cell's protein-making machinery. It has been used in the production of coronavirus vaccines. Moderna, which supplied millions of shots to the NHS, is seeking unspecified financial damages in a lawsuit filed in the US and Germany. The US biotech company had said in 2020 that it would not enforce its Covid-related patents while the pandemic continued. But in March, the pharma giant said it henceforth expected manufacturers to respect its intellectual property. In a statement, Pfizer said it had not yet been served with a suit.
