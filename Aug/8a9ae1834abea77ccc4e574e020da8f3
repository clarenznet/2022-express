Josep Borrell, high representative of foreign affairs, appeared at a conference in Spain to argue for a “selective” visa process. Russian oligarchs are currently banned from entering the bloc’s territory as part of sanctions packages.  Mr Borrell said: “To forbid entrance to all Russians is not a good idea. We have to be more selective. “There are many Russians that want to flee the country because they don’t want to live in this situation. “More than 300,000 Russians have [fled] their country because they don’t want to live under the rule of Putin. “Are we going to close the door to these Russians?

Members of the bloc are split over the policy, with Cyprus and Greece in favour of maintaining tourist visas. However Finland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states have expressed their desire for a full ban for all Russians.  READ MORE: 'Kremlin execution!'
