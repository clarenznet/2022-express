Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said the soccer star's Manchester Crown Court trial showed he had "two very different" personalities. "The one who is exposed for public consumption and the Ryan Giggs who exists on occasion behind closed doors," he said. Ex-Man Utd legend and Wales boss Giggs, 48, denies assaulting his former girlfriend, PR executive Kate Greville, 38, causing her actual bodily harm, and of controlling or coercive behaviour. He also denies assaulting her sister, Emma, 26, at his Manchester mansion in 2020. In his closing speech, Mr Wright said the star thought he could "get away with" treating Ms Greville however he liked. But he added: "All that changed...when the woman he had controlled or coerced in their lengthy, fractious and volatile relationship had the courage to stand up to him." The case continues.
