But the Countryfile TV star and broadcaster can't wait to swap farmwear for frocks on the BBC dance show - just eight months after giving birth. Helen, 39 - tipped 6/1 second favourite to win behind singer Fleur East at 7/2 - admitted yesterday: "I just wanted to wear nice dresses. I work on farms. I watch cows give birth and stand in wellies."  "I can't decide whether it's the best or worst thing I have ever agreed to. And I haven't even started yet. "I can't dance and I feel sick when I hear the theme tune. "Literally, I agreed a few days ago. They ask me, can I dance? And I say, 'No...isn't the point to go on it to learn to dance?'." But Helen, whose eight-year marriage to Leeds Rhinos rugby player Richie Myler ended in April, is confident she can juggle being a mum to Ernie, seven, Louis, five, and baby Elsie with Strictly's tough regime.  She said: "Any mum who gets a chance to go work and have their make-up done, their tea made and they learn something fun - that's a gift, isn't it." The other Strictly hopefuls include Fleur, 34, EastEnders' James Bye, 38, actress/comic Ellie Taylor, 38, singer Matt Goss, 53, radio's Tyler West, 26, ex-England footballer Tony Adams, 55, and singer and CBBC star Molly Rainford, 21. Completing the line-up are Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds, 27, comedian Jayde Adams, 37, 46-year-old Corrie stars Will Mellor and Kym Marsh, Loose Women's Kaye Adams, 59, radio and TV's Richie Anderson, 34, and wildlife cameraman and host Hamza Yassin, 32. The launch show is due to be recorded on September 7.
