The actress, who sparked a fitness revolution with her workout videos in the 1980s, has revealed she “is not proud” of having a facelift and won’t go under the knife again. She said: “We all know a lot of women who are wealthy who’ve had all kinds of facelifts and things like that – and they look terrible." “I had a facelift and I stopped because I don’t want to look distorted.” Double Oscar-winner Jane, whose long list of movies includes the iconic 1968 sci-fi romp Barbarella, prefers to stay beautiful naturally these days. She said: “I stay moisturised, I sleep, I move, I stay out of the sun and I have good friends who make me laugh. Laughter is a good thing too.” Jane hopes to encourage others to grow old just as gracefully. “I’m almost 85, but I don’t seem that old,” she told Vogue. “Just because you’re a certain age doesn’t mean you have to give up on life, give up on having fun.” She certainly seemed to be having fun as she posed for these pictures for H&M’s Move activewear. And she reckons her workouts are still paying dividends. She said: “Every day when I get out of a car, I thank the goddesses that... I’ve worked out to keep strong thighs.”
