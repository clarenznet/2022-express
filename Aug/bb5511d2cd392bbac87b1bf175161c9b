 Carol Vorderman, 61, appeared to be nude in a new video on her social media, leaving her fans shocked. The Countdown star chatted to the camera while wearing a very low cut nude-coloured bikini top, and it looked like she was in the buff. She promoted her new TikTok account from her retreat in Portugal, where she has been exercising a lot as well as enjoying some relaxation. Rob replied: “That flesh coloured bikini top made me look twice …. and I doubt I was the only one”. Exiled Sinners added: “I genuinely thought you were naked in this!” James wrote: “Genuinely thought she had the girls out there”. Carol later responded to the furore, writing: “Laughing …  but I AM NOT TOPLESS....”. She continued: “Just wearing a new bikini top from @omgmiamiswimwear....matching my SUN TAN courtesy of @tancreamworld....a brilliant SPF50 with instant bronzer included. “Anyway, I’m now on TikTok! “No idea what I’m doing (obvs) but it’s going to be lots of fun.
