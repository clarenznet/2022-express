Elton John, 75, falteringly stepped down to dry land, only for an aide to step in and hold onto him supportively, while another carried his bag - a Gucci/Adidas collaborative design. The Rocket Man star was dressed from head to toe in Gucci, as the Italian fashion house has offered to dress him for the entirety of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour. Elton wore a colourful Hawaiian style floral shirt paired with a bright turquoise GG brooch, Gucci-Adidas shorts, and matching trainers. Although some say Elton has been looking frail, his final tour is expected to extend for almost a year. He has also announced his intention to duet with Britney Spears on her planned comeback single, so we won't be saying farewell to Sir Elton's talents just yet.
