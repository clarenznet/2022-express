Her admission comes after the BBC broadcaster spoke candidly with her guest Sharon Ealy who suffered terrible injuries after being rushed by cows. Speaking about the incident, caller Sharon explained she had been walking in the fields near her home with her pet dog and a friend. She had been training to take part in the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge and opted to follow the same route she had been doing for the past three days.  Sharon had eyed a group of cows in the far corner of the field but initially was not concerned by their presence. "They then came bounding down the field and the next minute they were in front of us," she remarked. One of the cows began to snort at her and she admitted this was not something she had experienced before. Sharon said: "They charged at me, threw me in the air, I landed on all fours. They then all came around me and I thought, 'Oh my god, this is not good.' I got up and they pushed me back down again. DON'T MISS...
