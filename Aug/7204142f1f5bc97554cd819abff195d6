Victoria Beckham, 48, and husband David, 47, have joined family members including daughter Harper on a trip to the Rocky Mountains - and David was keen to introduce his wife to his biking skills. The fashion-loving ex-Spice Girl kept things casual for the occasion, wearing a sporty black outfit with a pair of trainers as she clung onto him, her arms squeezed around his waist. "Our Maverick Movement!" the helmet-clad star exclaimed to her 30.2 million Instagram followers. She added: "@davidbeckham has been trying to get me on the back of his bike for years and finally I did it! It was so much fun!!" Though she looked a little nervous, Victoria soon loosened up enough to rest her head affectionately on David's shoulder as the pair raced along.
