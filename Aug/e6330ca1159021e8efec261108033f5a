The former model and ex-wife of football star George Best was once the personal trainer for singer Cher and now owns a gym near her home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxon. Angie told Hello! magazine: "Everything has changed. We girls don't need to shrivel up and disappear into a corner just because we're a certain age. "I have no intention of doing so. The older I get, the more determined I am to work harder at staying healthy and youthful. "I want to get to 100 and still look good." Joining her on the photoshoot was reality TV star Calum, 41, her son with Northern Ireland footballer George, who died in 2005 aged 59.  Calum credits Angie with saving him from alcohol and drugs, which George failed to overcome, saying: "My dad chose the party lifestyle and my mum chose the healthy one. She's an incredible woman."
