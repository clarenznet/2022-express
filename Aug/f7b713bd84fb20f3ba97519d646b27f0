The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) is warning that the UK has become "a world leader in family breakdown" and is pressing for action to help people stay together. It is concerned marriage rates have hit a record low and argues other countries do more to support families through the tax system.  According to the Office for National Statistics, "marriage rates for opposite-sex couples have fallen to their lowest since 1862" with just 18.6 marriages per 1,000 unmarried men - and 17.2 marriages per 1,000 unmarried women - in 2019. A key CSJ call is for a spouse who is not working to be able to transfer much more of their personal tax allowance to a partner. It says if tax allowances for couples with dependent children were raised to 100 per cent of the personal allowance - usually £12,570 - this could boost finances by £2,500 a year. Under present rules, only £1,260 of the personal allowance can be transferred, meaning their tax bill falls by just £252.  The CSJ also wants the next Prime Minister to create an Office for Family, with a dedicated budget and civil service team, as a "matter of urgency". And it is confident pro-family policies would command strong public support. Polling by Opinium found 74 per cent of respondents agreed "reducing rates of family breakdown would help to tackle Britain's long-term problems". The recommendations are contained in a report, Repairing Our Society: A social justice manifesto for a thriving Britain. It states: "The evidence is clear that family breakdown underpins national emergencies - from our mental health crisis to the growth in loneliness. It is a key factor in problems from educational failure to homelessness."
