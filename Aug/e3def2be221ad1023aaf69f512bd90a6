There's less than three weeks remaining of the summer transfer window and Premier League clubs including Manchester United and Chelsea are still scrambling to get deals over the line. The window closes at 11pm on September 1 and Premier League clubs have spent over £1.3billion in total so far this summer with Chelsea the biggest spenders so far, splashing out north of £160million. But the Blues aren't done yet. Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the former Arsenal captain, is a surprise target while they are looking to rival Manchester United for Frenkie de Jong. Aubameyang's Barca team-mate has been wanted by United all summer long. But the £71million-rated Dutchman appears likelier to go to Stamford Bridge than United, who have recently ruled out signing Marko Arnautovic. Stuttgart's Sasa Kalajdzic is a possible option up top. United also continue to work on a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot for a total fee of around £19.5m. But there's plenty going on elsewhere too.
