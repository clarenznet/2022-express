The UK has a long history of democracy, and political events are often widely talked about around the country. Britain has a Parliament which makes laws, and a Prime Minister who leads the country and makes the important decisions. The two biggest political parties in the UK are the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, and they have different ideas on how the country should be run. The Labour Party is on the centre-left, and generally supports workers' rights, distributing money more evenly in society, and investing in public services. Labour was most recently in power from 1997 to 2010, when it introduced laws such as minimum wage, and put more money into education. The Conservative Party is on the centre-right, and generally supports keeping tradition, promoting businesses, and less government involvement in peopleâ€™s lives. Boris Johnson is the leader of the Conservative Party right now, but a new prime minister will be announced on September 5. The Conservative Party are often called the Tory Party, or Tories, and it is one of the oldest political parties in the UK. There are many smaller political parties which influence the UK, such as the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and the Scottish National Party. These all have different ideas and beliefs about how Britain could be better, and millions of people choose to vote for these in elections. The UK normally chooses a new prime minister every five years with a general election, where people vote for which party they want to win in their area.
