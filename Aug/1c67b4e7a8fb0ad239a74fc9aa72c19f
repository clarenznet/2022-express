The 75-year-old Scot helped defeat Wales 16-9 in the B2/B3 mixed-pairs bowls. George directed visually impaired bowler Melanie Innes.  He took the oldest gold-winner crown from compatriot Rosemary Lenton, 72, who won the bowls women's para pairs on Wednesday. Gordon Llewellyn, also 75 but five months younger, had to settle for silver playing for the Wales team yesterday. Neither veteran intends to retire. George, born in November 1946, was already the oldest Scot to compete at the Commonwealths. He said: "I'm reasonably pleased," but joked, "I think Rosemary is more pleased than I am." He added: "To be picked to play for Scotland is a dream."
