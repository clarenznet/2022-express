On Friday the Transport Secretary will open a consultation on whether to lift the ban on motorists driving anything larger than a 3.5-ton vehicle in order to solve driver shortages. The ban was imposed by the EU prior to Britain’s exit from the bloc. In a letter to MPs, the Transport Secretary wrote: “It has been suggested that now the UK has left the European Union, we may wish to allow all car drivers – not just those who passed their test before Jan 1, 1997, the right to drive these larger vehicles without the need for a further test. “Changes to the licensing categories would potentially create a greater pool of drivers. I am quite happy to explore this idea and how this may work in reality – without making any commitments to legislative change at this stage.” A Government source said: “We are past the days when EU directives were handed down on tablets of stone, and we should be prepared to liberalise where we can, testing the necessity for maintaining driving restrictions that were once thought unnecessary in this country. “Grant thinks we should have a fresh look at this, but of course, this has to be done with due regard for safety.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
