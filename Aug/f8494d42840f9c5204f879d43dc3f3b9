  BBC presenter Kimberley Walsh described Anton Du Beke as a “good addition” to the judging line-up of Strictly Come Dancing. The Girls Aloud star shared her thoughts on both Anton and his predecessor, Bruno Tonioli, in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk.      Kimberley, 40, was partnered up with Pasha Kovalev, 42, for the tenth series of Strictly in 2012. The Morning Live star became joint runner-up in the final alongside Denise van Outen and lost out to Louis Smith. Anton, 56, stepped in as a judge last year during the pandemic while Bruno was in the USA, after competing as a professional dancer on the show since it began in 2004. Bruno, 66, had been on Strictly’s judging panel since its debut and joined as a judge on US equivalent show Dancing With The Stars a year later.

Kimberley shared her thoughts on the new judging line-up, explaining: “I like Anton, actually, as a judge. “I think he's got so much knowledge and so much credibility to be there. “And I think the public loves that. He just doesn’t take anything too seriously.        She continued: “And also he's got the added benefit that he knows what it's like to be a pro, as well. “I think he's hilarious, and I think it's a good addition.” Asked how she felt about seeing Bruno go, she added: “I love Bruno as well! “I love him to bits and I’ve known him for years, but I guess it’s just hard for them when they’re juggling two series together.” READ MORE...
