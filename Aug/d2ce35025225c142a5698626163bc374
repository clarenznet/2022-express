The trio, featuring brothers Brian and Eddie Holland, crafted more than 250 songs in the 1960s and gave The Supremes 10 US No.1s, including Where Did Our Love Go, Baby Love, You Can't Hurry Love and Stop! In the Name of Love. Other classics included Heatwave and I'm Ready for Love (Martha and the Vandellas), How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You (Marvin Gaye) and Reach Out I'll Be There (the Four Tops). Creative lynchpin Dozier often manufactured crises in his own relationships to spark constant inspiration in a punishing work schedule set by Motown label boss Berry Gordy. Stop! In the Name of Love resulted from "an argument I had with a girl" he said. "I was trying to defuse the argument, and it came out, 'Stop in the name of love.' I was trying to be facetious, but she didn't think it was funny." Lamont Herbert Dozier was born in Detroit. He developed his fine ear by listening to his aunt play classical piano and by writing lyrics and poetry. He formed the doo-wop group The Romeos with school friends and enjoyed fleeting success with the song Fine Fine Baby before Gordy signed him up. Frustrated by the split of royalties at Motown, Dozier and the two Hollands set up rival label, Invictus, in 1967. They were sued by Gordy in a dispute only settled in 1977. Dozier later wrote Two Hearts for Phil Collins' Buster and worked with Alison Moyet, Simply Red and Eric Clapton. Married three times, Dozier is survived by six children. A cause of death has not been revealed
