Sunak supporter David Davis has said “a degree of delay is helpful to us” as candidates will complete more hustings before the Tory membership can vote on who they want to see as the next leader. The sending of ballots has been delayed due to security fears, allowing time for more scrutiny of Liz Truss’s policies, according to Mr Davis. Asked if it will help or hinder Mr Sunak, Mr Davis told Talk TV: “Well, I suppose it helps. I mean the most important thing is that it is secure and that is why they are doing it, they are doing it to make sure it can’t be meddled with by some foreign power or whatever because we are after all appointing the prime minister. “But I mean it cuts both ways. A degree of delay is helpful to us because after all this is a question of opening up these candidates for scrutiny and as we saw yesterday the Truss camp made an enormous mistake, talked about effectively cutting the salaries of doctors, nurses and teachers and had to withdraw from it and people will draw conclusions from that.” Voting papers had been due to start arriving at members’ homes this week but the process has been hampered, with eligible voters now expecting their ballot to arrive by next Thursday. Mr Davis added: “And that sort of exposure to challenge is a very important part of this process. I always thought it was slightly odd that we were proposing to give ballot papers out before most of the hustings rather than after they have completed. “So in one sense it will help a bit. On the other side of the coin, of course we have lost now the option for people to change their minds late on.” In a letter sent to Tory members, the Conservative Party's head of membership confirmed postal ballots will arrive "a little later than we originally said" as additional security measures are being taken". Postal ballots were due to arrive this week, but the letter says they should now receive their ballot by Thursday, August 11. FOLLOW BELOW FOR UPDATES...
