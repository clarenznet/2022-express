Will Smith, 53, and Jada Pinkett Smith, 50, have been spotted in their first public appearance as a couple since the debacle at the Oscars earlier this year, when the star stormed the stage at the annual Academy Awards to slap Chris Rock, after he made an unsavoury comment about his wife's shaved head amid her battle with alopecia. Will appeared in good spirits after grabbing a bite to eat alongside Jada in Malibu. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air star was dressed in a navy cap and zipped polo shirt alongside matching trousers. The Oscar-winning King Richard actor completed the look with white trainers. Jada trailed behind her husband, opting for a casual, black jumpsuit, which she styled with her sleeves rolled up. The actress had a multi-coloured flannel shirt tied around her waist as she accessorised the outfit with a pair of yellow tinted shades. Jada was seen holding on to Will’s shirt as her beau flashed a peace sign to onlookers as they headed towards their parked car.
