The US, which has already funnelled just shy of $7.5bn of military aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February, is preparing one of its largest donations so far, a US official told Reuters. The package is thought to include armoured medical vehicles and munitions for long-range weapons. The US recently increased the number of HIMARS, or high mobility artillery rocket systems, it was supplying to the Ukrainian resistance forces. It is believed the package will be formally announced on Monday, although US President Joe Biden is yet to officially sign off on the amount and contents. This comes as the Institute for the Study of War reports that Russia has already deployed 46 drones given to Moscow by Iran in the conflict. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned last month that Tehran intended to supply the drones to the Kremlin, in numbers reaching into the hundreds. During Vladimir Putin's visit to Iran last month, he was warmly received by the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Follow below for live updates...
