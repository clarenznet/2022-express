Britney Spears, 40, shared a number of unseen snaps from her recent boat holiday. The Toxic singer looked amazing as she used a fruit platter and hat to cover her ample assets. In other snaps, she can be seen dancing in a beautiful floral bikini, while in another she can be seen diving in the sea. Britney captioned the post in view of her 41.8 million Instagram followers: "Reflecting back Cute right ??? My first time sailing !!! "It was actually one of the best experiences of my life â€¦ and for 2 hours !!!" This comes after Britney was freed from her conservatorship late last year which she had been under since 2008.
