Allison wrote Charles, Prince Of Our Time in 1978, five years after his debut book, simply titled The Queen. And he edited The Royal Encyclopaedia with Sarah Riddell in 1991. Educated at Weymouth Grammar School, Allison worked on the Hampshire Chronicle before joining the BBC in 1957 as a sports commentator, and covered the 1966 World Cup Final at Wembley for radio. After a short spell as a freelance sports journalist, he returned to the BBC. As court correspondent, he commentated on the Duke of Windsor’s funeral. Allison played a major role in briefing the press on Princess Anne’s marriage to Captain Mark Phillips. But controversy arose when footage of the Queen opening Parliament was used in 1975 television thriller Hennessy. Allison was given a Chief Visionary Officer honour after he left the Palace to set up a public relations firm.  In 1980 he returned to small-screen media as controller of sport and outside broadcasts for Thames Television before becoming the company’s director of corporate affairs from 1980 to 1985. ITN audiences enjoyed Allison’s coverage of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer’s wedding in 1981. And he was a studio guest when ITN broadcast the funeral of the Princess of Wales in 1997. Allison had two daughters with his first wife Maureen Macdonald, and a son with second wife Jennifer Loy Weider. He died peacefully at a Winchester care home.
