She claimed some lifeguards began searching for the girl "in what appeared to be a non-methodical way" and "no one appeared to be in charge" The tragedy happened at Liquid Leisure Windsor, Datchet, Berkshire, on Saturday. The girl was reported as missing at 3.55pm and she was found at 5.10pm. She was pronounced dead in hospital. The victim, named unofficially as Kyra, was meant to be on the Total Wipeout-style challenge with around 10 friends as part of a birthday party The 41-year-old unnamed witness, from South Buckinghamshire, was there with her teenage daughter. She claimed: "I noticed not everyone was wearing life jackets and I saw a young female lifeguard not paying attention and staring across the open water rather than at the people she was meant to be looking at." The woman said she felt "uneasy" about the ratio of lifeguards to visitors. She said a lifeguard began to shout, telling people to get off the inflatable course, adding: "We realised a child was missing as two frantic women ran past screaming the child's name." "There seemed to be no plan of action. Lifeguards jumped in and started searching in what appeared to be a very non-methodical way." "Another member of staff started asking other members of staff if they were lifeguard trained. No one appeared to be in charge." The girl's death is unexplained. Liquid Leisure said: "Our thoughts are with those affected by this upsetting incident. As police are in the early stages of investigation, it would not be right to add further comment."
