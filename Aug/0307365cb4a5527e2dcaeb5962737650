ANDY MURRAY’S opponent sportingly conceded a point to the Scot after a controversial call in their first round meeting at the US Open. At 4-5 down in the first set, No.24 seed Francisco Cerundolo was serving to stay in the set. Already trailing 0-15, the Argentine scrambled to recover an angled Murray volley and recovered to win the point. But the 2012 champion immediately claimed to umpire Tim Jansen that the ball had bounced twice on Cerundolo’s side of the net before his return - and TV replays showed he was right. With booes ringing around the Louis Armstrong Stadium, umpire Tim Jansen announced that Cerundolo had conceded the point for reasons of “sportsmanship”. Three-time Grand Slam winner Murray gave him a thumbs-up and the booes turned to cheers.

The Argentine fought back to win the game but lost the first set 7-5 after serving a double fault on set point.

The former coach of Murray said: "I mean if you’re going to show it on the big screen you’ve kind of got to give the umpire the opportunity to change his mind." And when the Argentine conceded the point to the 2012 champion, Petchy added: "That’s amazing. That is the moment of the year."
