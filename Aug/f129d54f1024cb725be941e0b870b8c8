Tourists might be more likely to book a trip to Lapland but Finland’s capital city, Helsinki, is one of the country’s top destinations for British expats. The Scandinavian nation is also one of the world’s safest countries with 99 percent of expats saying they felt safe there according to William Russell. Finnish cuisine might take some getting used to but is shaped around seasonal produce including Arctic berries. In 2008, a Finnish pizza chain even won an American competition with a rye crust, mushroom, red onion and reindeer pizza. Nature loving expats will have plenty to enjoy in Finland as the country has a lot of open space to explore. According to InterNations, Finland has an unwritten code stating that every resident is allowed to use the country’s land. This means that residents are allowed to pick wild berries and go camping wherever they want as long as it’s not on someone’s land.
