US President Joe Biden is under increased pressure as a cost of living crisis impacts the US. An NBC news poll released on Sunday found that a staggering 74 percent of Americans say their country is heading in the wrong direction. In the survey, 58 percent of respondents expressed concerns that the US' "best years may already be behind us". Overall, 55 percent of Americans now disapprove of the job the Mr Biden is doing with just 42 percent saying they are happy. The US will go to the polls in the midterms in November, and many Democrats fear they could suffer as a result of Mr Biden's low approval ratings. In July, NPR spoke to three former White House chiefs of staff to gauge how well the Democrats can expect to do. Leon Panetta said: "Look, there's no question that there are serious problems out there facing President Biden and the Democrats. I think 85 percent of the American people think that the nation's headed in the wrong direction. "The worst part of this administration is that they have just failed in terms of the message to the American people. "You know, the president tries to address each of these crises, but it gives the impression that it's kind of a hit-and-miss process. "The key is to try to develop a very simple and coherent message about just exactly what is Joe Biden, and the Democratic Party for that matter - what are they trying to do for the nation?" John Sununu worked for the George H.W. Bush administration. He believes Mr Biden may have left it too late for a recovery, adding: "I don't think they have either the capacity or the time to make the changes necessary to try and salvage 2022." One threat that could see the Democrats unite behind Mr Biden is the possibility of Donald Trump running again in 2024. Earlier this month, the FBI conducted a search of Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after he was alleged to have took classified White House records there.

He also suggested they could have "planted" evidence. Some allies of the former President believe this could boost his 2024 hopes. Representative Randy Weber of Texas said recently: “He was not to be deterred." Another ally of Mr Trump told NBC: “Yes, we have problems. He’s aware of that. But the fact is that he needs a fight to give him focus. He has that now. He has that sense he’s in the arena.” DON'T MISS Cops fail to solve 95% of burglaries, they've given up JUDY FINNIGAN Truss told to warn Joe Biden to mind own business on Brexit Global world order is changing - Has the US finally lost its grip?

It’s a double-edged sword.” A third ally added: “Look, when I spoke to him it was kind of weird. It was like he didn’t really care about all of this going on or didn’t take it seriously,” this person said. “He thinks it’s all bull****-. I do, too. But bull**** can still cause you problems.”  But another supporter of the 45th president is more curious, warning that he is "slipping".
