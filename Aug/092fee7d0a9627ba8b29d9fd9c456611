Alex Scott took to Instagram earlier this evening in a stunning mini dress which highlighted her incredibly toned legs. The BBC presenter, 37, was all smiles as she posed up a storm after celebrating the Lionesses' win at the Euro 2022 final on Sunday.  In view of her 1.8 million followers, Alex showcased her phenomenal figure in a series of playful snaps. She captioned the set: "A bit of fashion & A bit of sport." The star donned a Dolce & Gabbana black mini dress which featured red roses and green foliage. She paired the designer number with a simple pair of black strappy heels and matching nails. In the third snap, Alex grinned from ear to ear as she stood next to the Euro 2022 trophy which the Lionesses bought home on Sunday night in their match against Germany.
