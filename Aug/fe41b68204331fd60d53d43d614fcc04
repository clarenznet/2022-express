Demonstrators from the “Get The L Out” group – which does not accept trans women as lesbian – were moved after footage online showed a lesbian and a transgender woman shouting at each other. An officer said: “To make sure it’s safe, we are going to remove you from the road and I want you to do that of your own accord.” A woman was then heard asking: “I want to understand that you are removing lesbians from an LGBT march?” The move ignited a Twitter row among those who disagree over the levels of inclusion trans women should be given. Journalist Suzanne Moore, who said she left the Guardian after she wrote about sex being a biological classification “not a feeling”, tweeted: “Police removing lesbians from Cardiff Pride. Right side of history boys?” But another user said: “Shame on those TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) for spreading their hatred and bigotry on the day of the Cardiff pride parade. It’s just baffling how much the existence of trans women affects so many small-minded people.”
