Lily-Rose Depp, 23, has taken to Instagram to share a snap of herself in a lacy pink lingerie set. It comes as the star promotes her upcoming HBO series, The Idol, which is set to hit screens in late 2022.  In the highly anticipated series, Lily portrays Jocelyn, a pop star who is seduced by a self-help guru, played by The Weeknd.  In the recent snaps, in which the star wears a pink lingerie set, showing off underboob as well as her lean physique, she appears to be in character.  The show also stars the late Anne Heche, but her role as of yet remains unspecified.  It is still unknown if the star, who died on Friday night after being involved in a car crash, was able to finish filming her part.
