Prince William and wife Kate Middleton, also 40, announced the three children would move to a school in Berkshire when they switch from Kensington Palace to Windsor.

According to a royal insider, Prince William and Kate Middleton maintained a hands-on approach to parenting during their time in London. The source told the Daily Mail: "Family time remains an absolute priority. “William’s experience as a young boy, being shuttled between two parents, has left him determined to lay down solid foundations for his own brood. “One, if not both of them, do the school drop-off or pick-up pretty much every day, and they always sit down to eat together as a family. “He is a very doting and hands-on dad.
