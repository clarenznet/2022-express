Coleen Nolan, 57, seemed to be enjoying the glamour of Sorrento as she celebrated her nephew Danny's wedding day, alongside family members including her sister Linda, 63, and daughter Ciara Fensome, 21. The wedding reception took place at a lavish hotel with breathtakingly beautiful balconies looking out over the sea, and boats could be seen bobbing dreamily in the background as Coleen filmed. An operatic version of Ed Sheeran's 'Perfect' played in the background, while guests milled around. Leopard-loving Coleen wowed in a maxi dress covered in the print, paired with beige peeptoe heels, and her retro outfit was accented by a very fancy fascinator. Meanwhile, sister Linda's presence will be reassuring for the Loose Women star, as she continues her recovery after her cancer treatment earlier this year. Another of Coleen's sisters, Anne, also discovered she had cancer in 2020, with both her and Linda handed a diagnosis within days of each other, but things seem to be looking up for the family now.
