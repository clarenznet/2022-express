Eurotunnel Le Shuttle said in a tweet: "A train has broken down in the tunnel and we are in the process of transferring customers to a separate passenger shuttle via the service tunnel, to return to our Folkestone terminal. We apologise sincerely for this inconvenience." One Twitter user at the scene shared a video of passengers walking in the underground tunnel. She said: "People have had to abandon their vehicles and currently being escorted on foot out. Horrific." There have been reports on social media that that a shuttle meant to take passengers away from the broken down train has also broken down, forcing passengers to leave their vehicles and the shuttle on foot through an emergency exit. Le Shuttle confirmed it was still running shuttles on a remaining line, but with reduced service. It said: "We are still operating Shuttles on our remaining line, but at a reduced service. Weâ€™re sorry for this delay - please check the app and website for latest timings." Several people on social media were reporting severe delays at Calais. More to follow.
