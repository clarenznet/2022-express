Tommy Lee, 59, has left his fans shocked after posting a totally nude photo on Instagram. The Motley Crue star bared all as he sat down in what looked like a hot tub, posing for the camera which he angled from the mouth downwards. “Ooooopppsss,” he wrote as he showed off his tattoos and famous appendage. The rocker, who was previously married to Pamela Anderson, was inundated with comments, several wondering how long it would take before Instagram took the post down. His wife Brittany Furlan wrote: “OH MY GOD”. Ryan wondered: “Does the camera add 5 lbs?” MCR.fan begged: “TOMMY PUT THE PHONE DOWN NOW”.
