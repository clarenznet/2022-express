Since the Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched, some 200,900 visa applications have been made to the UK Government - 55,900 via the Ukraine family scheme and 145,000 through the Ukraine sponsorship scheme. Of those, 107,900 people have arrived, made up of 32,000 people from the family scheme and 75,900 people with sponsors. Of the applications received, 1,000 have been refused while 22,500 people are still awaiting a conclusion to their application. A further 6,100 have been withdrawn. On top of this, the UK has had 21,900 applications to extend permission to stay in this country, of which 16,300 have been granted and 5,400 are still awaiting approval. But with Britons signing up in the millions to volunteer their homes for the scheme, many are concerned that more people have been unable to make the journey. And a family mediator has warned a crisis could be looming, as some families have found themselves homeless after disagreements with host families while others. Svitlana Stadnyk said 95 percent of the sponsorship pairing had been a success, but that "there is always going to be conflict" - and when that happens, it could leave a family out on the street if the local authority is unable to find suitable accommodation for them. In fact, the Local Government Association has already warned that councils are "concerned about Ukrainians refugees presenting as homeless", saying the "numbers are continuing to rise".
