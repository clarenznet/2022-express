As these "then and now" snaps show, at 50 the TV favourite could still run the Gauntlet and Hang Tough with the best of them. Bodybuilder Lightning - real name Kim Betts - slipped into the leotard she made famous before a date on ITV's This Morning yesterday with fellow Gladiators Hunter (James Crossley) and Saracen (Mike Lewis). Kim joined the ITV show in 1992 and was its longest-serving female star. Sharing the images, she said: "Thirty years they've been under a bed. This is a bit like trying on a wedding dress thirty years later." Reminiscing on This Morning, she added: "I still get lots of stories being sent to me saying, 'You inspired me so much, you changed my life, you motivated me.' You think, 'Wow'." But it's not all happy memories of the blockbuster Saturday night show. Kim said the leotard was "the one I disliked most...really uncomfortable".
