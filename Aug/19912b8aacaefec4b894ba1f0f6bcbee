Model Demi Rose, 27, could scarcely fit her assets into an unbelievably miniscule bikini top as she relaxed at her pool suite in Greece. First, followers saw her model a neon pink bikini top paired with low-waisted trousers, which highlighted her slim and toned waist. Then, the British beauty stepped the glamour up a notch further when she threw her head back as she reclined in the water, while wearing a barely-there black bikini. The skimpy material covered little more than the star's nipples as she enjoyed the use of her own private pool. Demi's Grecian getaway included both Mykonos and Santorini, so it's safe to say she's had her fair share of island adventures lately. The Ibiza and London-based model also posted some throwback snaps of earlier holidays in St Lucia.
