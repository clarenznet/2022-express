It is one of two main line termini in London to the south of the River Thames (the other being Waterloo) and is the fourth-busiest station in London. The station was originally opened by the London and Greenwich Railway as a local service. It subsequently served the London and Croydon Railway, the London and Brighton Railway and the South Eastern Railway, thus becoming an important London terminus. It was rebuilt in 1849 and again in 1864 to provide more services and increase capacity. Local services from London Bridge began to be electrified in the beginning of the 20th century, and had spread to national routes by the 1930s. The first underground station at London Bridge was part of the second section of the City & South London Railway (C&SLR). The company had been formed on July 28, 1884. It opened on October 7, 1999 as part of the Jubilee Line Extension.
