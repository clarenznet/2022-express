Chloe Kelly's extra-time winner gave England a memorable victory over Germany to win Euro 2022 in front of a record-breaking crowd at Wembley. The Lionesses went into the tournament as the favourites to clinch the honours and duly delivered on the biggest stage of all to seal their first-ever major trophy at the expense of their opponents, who pushed Sarina Weigman's side all the way but came up just short. Germany went agonisingly close to opening the scoring before half-time but were unable to turn the ball home from a goalmouth scramble, with Mary Earps eventually bringing the situation under control by getting her hands dirty. England went on to draw first blood after the interval through Ella Toone, who latched onto a delightful through ball from Georgia Stanway before lobbing the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the back of the net. England were pegged back with just over 10 minutes remaining whenÂ Lina Magull poked the ball home at the near post, but it was the Lionesses who had the final roar when Kelly finished past Merle Frohms in the second period of extra-time. The result marked a truly momentous occasion in the history of English football and secured the sweet taste of revenge for the Lionesses over Germany, who defeated them in their last European final appearance back in 2009.
