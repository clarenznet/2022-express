Demi Moore, 59, put her svelte silhouette on display in a new social media post as she posed aboard a luxury yacht. The actress could be seen smiling broadly as she soaked up the sun in a hot pink string bikini and an unbuttoned yellow shirt. Demi, who donned some dark aviator shades along with her casual outfit, captioned the shot: “Soaking up summer.” Demi’s ex-husband Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, even commented: “And it looks good on you!” It comes after Demi and Emma issued a family statement together about Bruce's health struggles with aphasia forcing him to retire from acting earlier this year.
