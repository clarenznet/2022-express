I reckon my daughter, 40 weeks pregnant and about to give birth any moment, could give those eagles a run for their money. As I wrote here two weeks ago, she banished us abroad while, seized by a ferocious nesting instinct, she built her baby sanctuary in our house (her own is being gutted by builders). Well, we’re back at the ranch, perched like a couple of cuckoos in Chloe’s carefully curated domestic haven. The kitchen is now dominated by a massive coffee machine which takes up almost an entire worktop. The dining room, now an office, is full of fearsomely complicated computer equipment. Our sitting room has been remodelled into a mother-and-baby chill centre with a vast daybed and huge flatscreen TV. Upstairs there’s a nursery suite and bedroom, plus a “dressing room” filled with rails of Chloe’s clothes and a sweet alcove full of baby outfits, cuddly toys, muslins and tiny hats and shoes. Somewhere, Chloe’s husband James pads about, all 6ft 4in of him, trying to look perfectly at home in this maternal shrine. And so do we. Am I bovvered? No, not a bit. In fact it’s lovely to bond with my daughter’s bump every day, watching the ripples across her enormous tummy, the sharp kicks from a tiny foot. I’ve learned things about pregnancy I’d forgotten or never knew. We chat about cervical sweeps, an alarmingly intimate procedure to get labour started. Other new induction techniques include a balloon catheter, literally a balloon in your vagina which puts pressure on your cervix to dilate. We giggle about this with a mixture of hilarity and trepidation. I keep sounding like my own mum by saying, “Well I never!” Thankfully, Chloe’s down to earth about the gory details of childbirth. She’s not expecting a transcendent spiritual experience, and I’m glad she’s so pragmatic. I’m loving this special mother-daughter time. I feel privileged to share Chloe’s great adventure, and can’t wait to meet my new granddaughter. Any time now!
