A Place in the Sun presenter Leah Charles-King showed off a silver futuristic design that showcased her incredible figure in a tiny metallic number. Almost every part of her outfit was shimmering silver, from her trainers to her mini dress and unusual hat, which looked like a disco ball version of the Statue of Liberty spikes. She boasted feathery wings, silver arm bands and even a silver lipstick for maximum futuristic effect. "Made with my own fair hands," Leah posted to almost 12,000 Instagram followers, using hashtags including #mirrorballfantasy, #partyqueen and #masquerade. "Whatcha think??" she quizzed, after uploading photos of costume creation in progress, including the work she'd done to produce extremely eye-catching disco balls.
