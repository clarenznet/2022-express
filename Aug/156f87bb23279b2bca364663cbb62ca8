The beginning of autumn is the perfect time to refresh the entrance and the entire house by simply changing the colour of the front door. Which is the perfect one for you? One colour homeowners should avoid for their front door is moss green as it is "dull and dingy," according to Nishtha Sadana, the creative director and founder of NISH. Other colours to avoid are black, as it breaks the Feng Shui of the home, and brown, as it is a boring colour which brings a "sense of insecurity," said Nishtha. Violet on the front door "may not be the best option," she explained, as it can stand out too much and make it difficult to "blend with the neighbourhood or community". Lucy Searle, from Homes & Gardens, recommended people avoid bright tones or colours that will divide opinion. She said: "If you are selling your home any time soon it's vital to choose neutral colours that won't offend," such as neutral colours that "will make a front door more attractive, too".

The experts recommended this colour for any interior feature as it is a timeless tone and "the perfect door choice for your home".  The interior experts revealed the dusty pink tone that was so trendy a few years ago is now over and lilac is the new arrival.
