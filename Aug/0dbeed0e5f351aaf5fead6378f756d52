Shakira, 45, clung onto her two sons tightly during a touching embrace, which the Hips Don't Lie star then posted a photo of to her 76 million followers on Instagram. She shares sons Sasha, seven, and Milan, nine, with ex-husband Gerard Pique. The songstress stands accused of defrauding the Spanish Treasury out of £12 million via unpaid taxes, and prosecutors are reportedly keen to secure the maximum possible sentence (eight years) for the crime. In addition, they are calling for a £19.2 million fine to be applied to the Colombian beauty if she is found guilty - but the star, who had sprung to fame in 2001 with the hit 'Whenever, Wherever' says she is not liable. The multi-million album-selling legend registered as a resident of Spain in 2015, but in three contested years prior to that, prosecutors argue she was already living there and dodging her taxes by claiming to reside abroad. Shakira, who is known for her raunchy dances and costumes, wrote alongside the latest snap of herself and her children: "El amor más puro", which translates to "the purest love".
