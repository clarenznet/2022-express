Jennifer Aniston, 53, proved she is ageing backwards when she stunned at The Hollywood Reporter 2021 Power 100 Women in Entertainment in December 2021. She was introduced on to the stage by The US Office star Steve Carell. The Friends actress won the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at the glitzy bash, and called it an “honour of the highest magnitude”. She continued: “If I went back in time to my 19-year-old self, waitressing tables in New York and auditioning for every off, off, off, off, not-even-close-to-Broadway show and someone came up to me and said, ‘One day, you’ll be receiving The Sherry Lansing Leadership Award,’ I would’ve looked at them like they were crazy and said, ‘Who’s Sherry Lansing?' “Sherry Lansing, people like to throw around the word ‘trailblazer,’ but in your case, you have blazed a trail for the rest of us to follow. “The first woman to run a studio, with strings and strings of box office hits and Academy Award-winning films to your name. “You truly paved the way for us women to have the voices and the platforms that we have today, and somehow, you remained one of the kindest and most generous people.”
