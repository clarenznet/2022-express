Former champion Bianca Andreescu apologised to Nike after complaining about her “bad” dress and then leaving the court to change. The Canadian, who won here in 2019, advanced to the second round of the US Open with a 6-0 3-6 6-1 win over France's Harmony Tan. But the world No.50 was less happy about her original outfit - and appealed to the umpire to allow her to leave the Grandstand court to fix her wardrobe malfunction. “Can this not count as one of my changeovers because, I mean, it’s not my fault, it’s Nike’s fault,” Andreescu said on court. “This dress is so bad."

He was very nice to say it was totally okay. I could have definitely used a different choice of wording.
