Taking to Facebook, West Yorkshire Police posted a photo which showed a silver BMW car parked halfway across someone's driveway in Garforth, Leeds. After officers could not locate the driver, they removed the car. The post read: "Officers attended at an address in Garforth this morning where a vehicle had parked across a drive to the point where the householder could not get their car out of the drive. "Officers carried out enquires but the owner could not be located so unfortunately the vehicle had to be removed." The Facebook post has received more than 2,500 reactions and more than 1,000 comments. Many jumped in to praise police for removing the selfish parker's vehicle, reports Leeds Live. Jenny Gillard said: "Glad to read the car got towed. Maybe the driver will think twice next time they consider blocking a driveway." Similarly, Lisa Longbottom wrote: "Not sure why it says ‘unfortunately the car had to be removed’ thank goodness the car was removed. Selfish people blocking someone’s drive." Some had thought parking was a council or civil issue, but Facebook user Ian Foss believes police were right to take action. He commented: "If the car is actively blocking a driveway preventing someone from getting out, rather than getting in, then they can legally get it towed. Serves them right for being so inconsiderate." And finally, Heather Walker said: "I used to live in that house many years ago and this was a regular occurrence. I missed work on more than one occasion due to not being able to get out of the drive. It was us that got the white lines painted on that corner but it made no difference. People just didn't care! Glad to see it is being dealt with." The new Highway Code rules came into effect on January 29 of this year. Rule 243 states the 12 places you should not stop or park, and this includes "in front of an entrance to a property". This means that if someone has parked in front of your driveway, they would be in breach of this rule.
