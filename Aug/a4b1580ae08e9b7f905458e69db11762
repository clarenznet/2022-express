China's threat to Taiwan is "more serious than ever," but the island will stand firm to protect its sovereignty, according to Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. Mr Wu's defiant message comes as Chinese military drills enter another day of aggression on Tuesday, after a four-day show of force following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taipei last week. Speaking to CNN, he said: "China has always been threatening Taiwan for years and it's getting more serious in the last few years. Whether Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan or not, the Chinese military threat against Taiwan has always been there and that is the fact that we need to deal with. I worry that China may really launch a war against Taiwan. But what it is doing right now is trying to scare us and the best way to deal with it (is) to show to China that we are not scared." His comments come amid mounting pressure for US President Joe Biden to offer more support for the encircled nation. Nikki Haley, former US adviser to the UN has warned that the US President is not taking a strong enough stance against Chinese military aggression and that of other hostile leaders across the world. She told Fox News:Â "It's been a total mess. And what we've seen is Biden run scared from his shadow the entire administration. We've got to start showing strength and preventing wars. We've got to start taking the world back towards an avenue of peace and not one that runs from any enemy that seems to shout louder, and that's what we've watched Biden do and I think it's a terrible mistake and we have to snap out of it."
