Eamonn Holmes, 62, has posted a brand new mirror selfie on Instagram, where he boasts 756k followers. Wearing a navy blue polo shirt and white trousers, the former This Morning host smiled as he held up his phone and leant on his walking stick. Eamonn, who is married to Ruth Langsford, wrote: “All set to walk the Dog ..... I just need to find out where the dog has disappeared to”. Ruth’s Loose Women co-star Coleen Nolan commented: “You look so well xxx”. To this, Eamonn replied: “Stop it,” with a laughing face emoji. Another panellist, Saira Khan, asked: “Whose that handsome dude?” Carol Vorderman wrote: “Look at you slim Jim”, and Eamonn responded: “Ha ha ...... Not in your class butclet's hope I stay that way x [sic]”. Countdown star Carol added: “well it's good to see you looking well E...really good”. Eamonn has regularly been pictured using a walking stick as he suffers from chronic back pain after trapping a sciatic nerve, and suffers from bulging discs in his spine. “Even my own family are bored of my moaning,” he said. “It has caused some strain and Ruth is fed up of hearing about it and of me saying I can’t walk the dog or tidy up, but I can’t help it. It’s agony.” However, he highlighted that taking the painkiller Tramadol helps him cope with the pains. He also exercises with his trainer James, who has previously worked with Premier League footballers and whose methods get him “moving in the mornings”.
