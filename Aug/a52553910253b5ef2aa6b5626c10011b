Last week, Neighbours fans were left emotional after the Channel 5 soap came to an end after 37 years. Viewers also saw some old faces make a return for its final episode including pop star Kylie Minogue and West End actor Jason Donovan. However, some Neighbours fans have been left outraged after the programme, which usually aired at 6pm, has been replaced with Cash in the Attic. Many upset fans have since taken to social media to air their frustrations. Some have even threatened to boycott Channel 5 over Neighbours’ replacement, while others refuse to watch the channel at all. Taking to Twitter, Neighbours fan Jules fumed: “F***s sake, Cash in the Attic instead of #Neighbours Channel 5, I hate you! #PerfectBlend.” (sic) Ruby Kathryn wrote: “When it kicks in that @neighbours is not on anymore! @channel5_tv has replaced this beloved institution with horrible landlords, earlier H&A and Cash in the Attic!

I wonder how many daily viewers you’ve just permanently lost apart from me! #Neighbours #imissneighbours.” While fan Stephanie raged: “#channel5isdeadtome #Neighbours watching Cash in the Attic is about as exciting as watching my dog chew his nails … no… in fact my dog is way more entertaining … Channel 5 - ‘Ciao, adios I’m done’!” “Can’t wait to see what happens tonight in ‘Cash in the attic’” said NO ONE EVER #benfrow @channel5_tv #neighbours,” User @for_neighbours added. William tweeted: “I was thinking of starting a boycott of Cash in the Attic as a protest against it replacing #neighbours but as I doubt anybody will watch that s**t anyway I won't waste my time.” James Webb went on to comment: “Used to watch @5_News before @NeighboursTV now they’ve replaced #Neighbours with Cash in the Attic repeats so I won’t bother watching @channel5_tv at all. #bringbackneighbours @neighbours.” However, not all viewers were unhappy with the shake-up as Dan penned: "Well that’s the end of #Neighbours as I said I’ve not watched for years but it’s the end of an era. A show axed because of money rather than losing its audience! Anyway Cash in The Attic replaces it on Monday so not all bad." Luna added: "Sooooo, who's excited for cash in in the attic, next week?" On Friday, gutted fans tuned in to watch the final episodes of Neighbours play out.
