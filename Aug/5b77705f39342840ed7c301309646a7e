Emmerdale star Rebecca Sarker left her 56,000 Instagram fans stunned as she continues to document her time abroad. The star, who plays Doctor Manpreet Jutla on the hit ITV soap, donned a blue patterned bikini as she posed casually on a white sand beach while holding a snorkel. Rebecca, 47, flaunted her enviably toned stomach and wore her brown locks in their natural wave over her shoulders. She captioned the snap: "Wet n' wild," before revealing in hashtags that she purchased the snorkel in a supermarket, while branding herself an "amateur". It comes after Rebecca shared a snap of herself in a red bikini while soaking in beautiful tropical views while sitting on the dock of a bay just a day ago.
