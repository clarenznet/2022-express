Inrix, a traffic monitoring site, reported that all traffic was temporarily held between junction 22 at Burnham-on-Sea and Junction 21 at Weston-super-Mare. Further up the motorway, traffic was reported to be "stop-start".   Traffic cameras showed that all three lanes were stationary for a time on the motorway. Holiday traffic between junction 21 at Weston-super-Mare and junction 17 at Cribbs Causeway was also reportedly causing congestion. National Highways had also reported severe congestion on the M5 slip road to the M6 in Birmingham. Traffic has now reportedly returned to normal following the incidents earlier.  The news comes following a "concern for welfare incident" earlier today which saw the M5 closed between junction 25 and junction 26. An air ambulance attended the scene. Avon and Somerset Police said in a tweet: "The M5 is currently closed in both directions between J25 and J26 while emergency services respond to a concern for welfare incident. "The air ambulance is due land on the carriageway to take an injured man to hospital. Motorists are advised to expect delays." It added: "The motorway is now open. The injured man has been taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
