The Ukrainian Special Forces are behind the dozen powerful blasts at the Russian airbase in Crimea on Tuesday, a senior Ukrainian official has told Sky News. One person was killed in a series of blasts at an airbase near seaside resorts which left dozens of onlooking beachgoers rattled. Videos were posted to social media of thick black smoke rising from the site and people fleeing the beaches. Witnesses also reported a fire on a runway and damage to nearby homes, Crimea Today News said on Telegram. The Russian Defence Ministry was left scrambling, initially claiming no damage was done or people injured and insisting the damage was not a result of Ukrainian attacks.
