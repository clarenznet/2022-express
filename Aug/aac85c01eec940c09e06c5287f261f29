Antonio Banderas, 61, and his 40-year-old partner Nicole Kimpel, who is of Dutch and German origin, both looked on top of the world as they arrived at the Starlite Porcelanosa gala last weekend, which Antonio chaired. Spanish native Antonio recently moved back to his home city of Malaga after a long spell in Surrey, and previous time spent in Hollywood. The Original Sin actor is now actively involved in charitable events such as this latest one, which raises money for the Starlite Foundation. Antonio gave the crowds a warm smile as he strutted on the red carpet in a cream blazer, white shirt and black bow tie, together with black trousers and boots. Meanwhile Nicole was the centre of attention in her blue sequined maxi dress and matching blue satin purse.
