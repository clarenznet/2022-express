LED light from TVs, phones and laptops may bring on obesity and psychological problems by negatively affecting cells, a US team found. Their findings show cell function in fruit flies – which have cells similar to humans’ – broke down if they were exposed to blue light. But Professor Jadwiga Giebultowicz, of Oregon State University, said: “We used fairly strong blue light – humans are exposed to less intense light, so cellular damage may be less dramatic.” The study was published in Frontiers in Ageing.
