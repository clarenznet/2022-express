Nick Knowles, 59, has taken to Twitter in a post calling out Red Bull racing fans after a Twitter user posted an aggressive message with Nick tagged in. The expletive-laden post was retweeted by the TV presenter, in view of his 171,000 followers. It came after upset Twitter user, @p1733ctn, called out Nick, writing: “You really are a stupid sad ****. Stick to DIY and f*** off away from F1.” The BBC star responded, criticising Formula 1 for being “so happy” to have such fans in the sport.

That’s how to start your birthday.” In a previous post, the same user had claimed he was a McLaren fan. Nick’s followers were keen to support him in the comment section, with some urging the F1 to "target abusive fans" of Red Bull star Max Verstappen. @Yesman073 wrote: “That's why this new FIA directive needs to target Max fans. “In 40 years of watching F1 I have never known abuse like the kind that comes from Max fans.
