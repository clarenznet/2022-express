Drought has left many British water companies struggling with supply, as weeks without rain and months of below-average rainfall push them to the brink. Southern Water became the first firm to impose water usage limits last week, and its hosepipe ban is now in effect. The company is the first of many to warn customers to reduce consumption and one of two requiring them to follow restrictions or face penalties.

While they have not officially scheduled a hosepipe ban, Thames Water, South West Water and Welsh Water have warned they may eventually have to take action.
