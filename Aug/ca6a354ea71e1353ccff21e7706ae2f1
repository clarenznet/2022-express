Joan Collins, 89, looked stunning and happy in new photos with her husband, Percy Gibson, 56. The star is recovering after a health scare which saw her being airlifted to hospital. The actress took to Instagram where she shared a photo of herself gazing into producer Percy’s eyes. She was glamorous as ever with a full face of makeup, enormous sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat. "When it's 100 degrees in the shade I am grateful to have a pool,” wrote Joan, alongside the hashtags #funinthesun #feelinggood and #summer. Last month, she suffered a pinched nerve in her leg while on holiday in Monaco, which left her in “excruciating pain”. Luckily, the star is said to be “recovering and doing fine”.
