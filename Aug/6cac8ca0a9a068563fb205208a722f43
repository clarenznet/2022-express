The Clean Water Action Group said it was "unacceptable" and people were becoming ill in East Sussex waters. The Bexhill Chamber of Commerce also wrote to local Tory MP Huw Merriman to demand he take the lead in securing Â£1million in compensation for the town. Southern Water has apologised for last week's pollution and said protecting the environment was a "priority". About 400 people joined Amanda Jobson, Clean Water Action campaign leader, on the beach in St Leonards yesterday. She said: "We want tougher regulations and for the Government to come down harder on Ofwat. The performance in the past five years of Southern Water has been horrendous." "People have been getting very sick, including children and the elderly. We will not tolerate or accept this, enough is enough." In his letter to Mr Merriman, Bexhill Chamber of Commerce president Howard Martin said the town's reputation was "literally going down the pan." "We are now known as the sewer pipe of Sussex", he added.
