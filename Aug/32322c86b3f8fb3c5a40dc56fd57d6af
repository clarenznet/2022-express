Actress Elizabeth Hurley, 57, looked radiant as she marked World Elephant Day today. The star participated in an elephant Puja offering at Sudeley Castle, Glocestershire. Beaming with joy, Liz posed next to a beautiful wicker elephant adorned with flowers. She wore a white maxi dress with frilly sleeves, and a white flower placed in her flowing brunette tresses. Sporting her trademark glamorous makeup, Liz accessorised with a simple gold necklace and tan sandals. The mum-of-one has recently been spotted in a bikini in the trailer for her new film, Christmas in the Caribbean. Written by Phillipe Martinez and Nathalie Cox, the film will follow Rachel (played by Liz), a hopeless romantic who is jilted at the altar. “An offer to shoot a movie in the Caribbean, after more than 18 months of lockdowns, was irresistible,” Liz told Variety, “‘Christmas in the Caribbean’ is a fun, lively antidote to all that misery.”
