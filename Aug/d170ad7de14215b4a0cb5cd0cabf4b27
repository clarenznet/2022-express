This year has been a huge one for the Royal Family, with the Queen celebrating 70 years on the throne on February 6, 2022. Even the property market has been affected by the country's love of the monarchy. According to Uswitch, properties on royal named streets including words such as William or King can sell for much more than their non-royal counterparts. Tower Hamlets saw the most dramatic difference. The average property price is £454,411, but the average sale price on a royal street is £590,522. This is a huge 29.95 percent price increase.
