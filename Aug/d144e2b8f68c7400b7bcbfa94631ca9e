Ant McPartlin, 46, and Dec Donnelly, 46, have been pictured back at work as they film 'skydiving' scenes for the I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! advert. ITV appeared to be pulling out all the stops for the new series as the duo were seen hooked up to harnesses and suspended by a wire as they simulated jumping out of a helicopter. The pair were also seen in a black helicopter filming further scenes for the advert, with a lighting umbrella seen in front of the windshield. Ant and Dec appeared in good spirits during the shoot, with the pair seen laughing and joking with the crew between scenes. This comes after Dec was left "beyond devastated" last month by the death of his "darling" brother Dermot Donnelly, who collapsed in his Newcastle parish. Dec also welcomed his second child just a week after his brother's shock passing.
