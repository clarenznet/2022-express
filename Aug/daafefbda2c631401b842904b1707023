Danni Menzies, 33, sizzled in her blue and yellow patterned swimsuit, with cut out sections that emphasised her slim waist. The sports-mad star, who showed off her muscular thighs by the pool, had been to the North African country with @fiaformulae. The trip had given her the opportunity to enjoy some motor racing action, which was a perfect fit with her long standing passion for fast cars. "This was such a good weekend," she assured her 102,000 followers alongside snaps in which she seemingly could not stop smiling. She added of @fiaformulae: "If I could just take you guys everywhere that be great!"
