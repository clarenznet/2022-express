Around 3.5 million people across the UK are already under a hospipe ban, after the recent hot weather. The summer has seen parts of the country reaching new record-high temperatures, and has led to Southern Water introducing a ban last week, whilst South East Water, and Yorkshire Water were set to impose one from Friday, August 12. According to the Water Industry Act 1991, people are not permitted to do the following during a hosepipe ban:  The ban also applies to anything "adapted" to serve as a hosepipe, according to South East Water. This includes garden sprinklers, irrigation systems, and pressure washers. However, according to Caroline Gould, head of legal at South East Water: “The restrictions under the Water Industry Act 1991 apply to domestic swimming and paddling pools, not hot tubs. We believe that this is due to hot tubs at the time being viewed more as baths, which are not a restricted activity." Under the 1991 Water Industry Act, newly-laid lawns may also be watered with a hosepipe, within 28 days of being planted - even if there is a hosepipe ban in place. Despite these exceptions being permitted, Caroline explained that South East Water is asking its customers “to consider their usage and to wait until cooler weather and demand for water reduces for any water use that is not essential or necessary”. This is due to the fact that months of below-average rainfall has led to reduced water levels in reservoirs and rivers. Whilst a hosepipe ban is in place, anyone caught breaching it risks a fine of up to £1,000. According to the government's website: "If there are restrictions on water use in your area, please follow the guidance given. "Use water-efficiency devices in your home and garden. Your water company can provide advice on how to order and install them. Many water companies also provide water-saving devices for free. Advice about gardening is available from Water UK."
