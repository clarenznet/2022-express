Sarah Hyland, 31, finally tied the knot with her partner Wells Adams, 38, after Covid forced them to delay their wedding. Many of Sarahâ€™s Modern Family co-stars attended their big day including Sofia Vergara, 50, Julie Bowen, 52, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, 46, and Nolan Gould, 23. Sofia shared some intimate snaps of the day, especially as she posed for photos with Jesse and Nolan. She looked gorgeous in an A-line white dress with a sophisticated black floral pattern. The ceremony took place in California, three years after Wells proposed to Sarah.
