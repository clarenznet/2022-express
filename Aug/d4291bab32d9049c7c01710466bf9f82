The Kremlin had alleged tapped calls proved Washington is approving attacks by US-made Himars rockets, helping Ukraine regain land. Himars can launch precision-guided missiles at targets 45 miles away - far further than the country previously had in its armoury.  Moscow said the calls proved the US "is directly responsible for all rocket attacks on Donbas and other regions". But the Pentagon said it was giving "information to help Kyiv understand the threats it faces".
