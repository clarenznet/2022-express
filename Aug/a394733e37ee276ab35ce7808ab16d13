Nicola Peltz, 27, packed on the PDA with husband Brooklyn Beckham, 23, at the Variety Power Of Young Hollywood Event. The actress stepped out in a Fendi two-piece for the prestigious event, exposing her toned midriff with the low-rise trousers. The corset-style belted bustier showed off her petite frame, while Brooklyn opted for an all-black ensemble. Nicola was at the event to support her husband, who was honoured during the evening. This comes as Nicola finally addressed the apparent 'feud' she has with her mother-in-law Victoria Beckham. Nicola quashed all rumours, with Brooklyn jumping to his wife's defence: "Everyone gets along, which is good."
