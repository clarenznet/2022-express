  Dianne Buswell has opened up about what it’s like to live about 15,000 km away from her home in an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. The Strictly Come Dancing star explained that while home feels “far away”, she absolutely “loves the UK”.       Dianne, 33, is a Strictly favourite and recently faced off some huge challenges in ITV’s Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof. As a staple of British TV, the Aussie dancer reflected on adjusting to life in the UK and whether she noticed any huge cultural differences. “I don’t think there’s anything I find too weird about living here,” Dianne reasoned. “I’ve been here now six years and that’s gone very quickly.

In Strictly 2018, the Youtuber and Australian dancer made it all the way to the final, before losing out to Stacey Dooley and her partner Kevin Clifton - who also ended up together. Speaking to Express.co.uk after setting a new Guinness world record for furthest distance danced by a couple with professional partner Pasquale La Rocca, Dianne reflected on her romance with Joe. Asked if she ever thought she’d ever find love with a celebrity partner on the show, she replied: “I never did, no.      “And I feel like all the stars aligned with Joe because we're just literally such similar people in so many ways. “We're very different in ways too, but just our personalities just click so, so well. “I always think it's so weird how we met and I feel like everything was just aligned in the right place, right time for both of us. It was pretty special. “It has been almost four years, which is amazing. I mean it’s crazy, isn’t it? It’s gone so fast!”       Dianne went on to reveal that she and Joe still dance together, although his memory of the moves is a bit rusty. “He loves dancing,” she mused. “And you know, when we're at home and a nice song comes on the radio or something, I definitely go like, ‘Oh do you remember this Joe - that song that we danced to on the show?’ “And Joe will be like, ‘I can't remember any of that now,’ but then I’ll reenact the whole dance and he’ll be like, ‘How do you do that?’ So yeah, we still do have a joke around.” Speaking about smashing a world record shortly ahead of her return to Strictly this Autumn, Dianne revealed: “It was really fun, actually. I thought it would be harder than it was. Two hours and 15 minutes of non-stop dancing - it’s something I can tick off my bucket list!” Dianne relied on Sure’s new 72H Nonstop Protection deodorant to keep her protected from sweat and odour as she pushed herself to her limits in the record-breaking dance session. Sure wants to encourage people to push themselves to their limits this summer without the fear of sweating.
