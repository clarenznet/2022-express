Izabella Scorupco looks like she hasn't aged a day since starring as Natalya Simonova in the James Bond film GoldenEye in 1995. The Polish actress, 52, shared a series of jaw-dropping snaps of herself inview of her 142,000 followers, including one of her in a simple black bikini as she enjoyed a boat ride. Another saw her looking seriously into the camera while donning a black, halterneck bikini as she spent time in Los Angeles. One of the most recent snaps saw her pose with Kiss frontman Gene Simmons as she playfully poked her tongue out. Celebrating the end of 2020, Izabella kicked up one toned leg as she sipped champagne while wearing a stunning red mini dress and gold, tie-up heels. GoldenEye airs tonight at 8pm on ITV.
