Prince Harry was snapped visiting the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda last week as he paid respects to victims of the genocide against the Tutsi which killed hundreds of thousands of people in 1994. The official account for the Kigali Genocide Memorial shared the images on Twitter. The caption read: "While in Rwanda, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex paid his respects to victims of the Genocide against the Tutsi at the Kigali Genocide Memorial." Omid Scobie, who co-authored Finding Freedom with Carolyn Durand, claimed the Duke wrote in the visitor book: "I am profoundly moved by what I have witnessed. "What an incredible show of unity and resilience we now see. "Thank you for showing us all the way to healing and forgiveness.
