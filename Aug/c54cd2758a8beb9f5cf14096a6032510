Simon Cowell, 62, looked sprightly in recent pictures as the music mogul posed on the red carpet alongside a number of cute dogs including a German Shepherd husky mix. The event was held at America’s Got Talent Live show at The Sheraton in Pasadena.  He appeared in great spirits as he showed off the pooch, as well as his recent weight loss transformation.  The star was dressed in a navy wool jumper with matching trousers as he beamed, holding the pup.  Speaking of how he achieved the weight loss, he told The Sun in 2020 that he reduced his meat intake and completely cut out sugar.  The BGT judge said: “Cutting all that out is what has made a difference, genuinely.”
