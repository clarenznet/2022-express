Jane Fonda, 84, has put on a stunning display while debuting her new workout range with clothing brand, H&M. The Grace and Frankie actress showed off her gym-honed figure in the black workout wear. Hollywood icon Jane has teamed up with H&M Move, the new move wear brand that aims to make stylish, functional, and technically innovative workout clothes more accessible. The actress is not new to the fitness world, with her being the face of hit VHS workout tapes in the 80s. She was known for her skintight leotards and knit leg warmers, as the star showed off her flexibility in aerobics routines. Reflecting on her 1981 release Jane Fonda's Workout, the actress said: "An exercise outfit helps because it sets this time apart from the rest of your day and makes it matter more!"
