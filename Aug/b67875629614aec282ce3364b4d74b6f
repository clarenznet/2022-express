The summer transfer window closes at 11pm on Thursday but there are still more Premier League deals to get over the line before then, including at Manchester United and Chelsea. Express Sport keeps you updated on all the latest news. United are poised to announce the Â£84million signing of Antony in the coming days. The Red Devils have struck a deal with Ajax that will make the Brazil winger their second-most expensive addition of all time. They're not done there though and may even sign as many as four players - a forward, a back-up goalkeeper, a right-back and a midfielder - before the deadline. Chelsea are also busy and want to snap up both Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Anthony Gordon to strengthen their attack. Liverpool are desperately searching for a late deal for a midfielder after Jurgen Klopp's U-turn while Newcastle may be spooked into more signings after injuries. Tottenham and Arsenal have both been tipped to make one more signing, too. Express Sport keeps you updated with all the latest transfer rumours and done deals below...
