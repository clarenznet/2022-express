Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, was left red-faced by Meghan's comments about their alleged feud during her 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, according to Vanity Fair royal author Katie Nicholl. During the bombshell interview, Meghan levelled several accusations against the Royal Family, including that they were racist towards Meghan and Harry’s son Archie, and that Kate had made Meghan "cry" before her 2018 wedding. Meghan told Oprah: “A few days before the wedding, Kate was upset about something pertaining — yes, the issue was correct — about flower girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings.” Commenting on the impact of this story, Ms Nicholl told OK! Magazine: "Kate has never wanted any suggestion of a rift with Meghan to come out in the press, so for this story to be circulating is very hard. From what I hear, there are different versions of the bridesmaid story, not just the one Meghan discussed. Kate felt it was all sorted, so to have it brought up again was mortifying. Kate is not in a position to respond and Meghan and Harry know that.” FOLLOW BELOW FOR LIVE UPDATES...
