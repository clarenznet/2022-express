The amounts of cash vary depending on where you live. Moving to a smaller house from London could free up £239,200 and in the South-east £171,100. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the average figure drops to £80,500 and in the North-east you could unlock, £59,800, says Savills. The estate agent said more than 3.6 million homes with at least two bedrooms are owned by over-65s in England. Spokesman Lucian Cook, said: “Homeowners are reluctant to downsize given their attachment to the family home, a lack of financial incentive and a limited supply of good retirement accommodation. “But with the costs of running a home increasing so rapidly, the financial benefits of downsizing are likely to come to the fore in the next 12 to 18 months.”
