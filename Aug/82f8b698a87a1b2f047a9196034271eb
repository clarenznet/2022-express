Cindy Crawford, 56, took to Instagram in a loved up post showing off hers and 60-year-old husband Rande Gerber’s recent summer holiday. The pair have been married for nearly 25 years and share two children, Kaia and Presley.  The supermodel stunned alongside handsome husband Rande, as they posed among the surroundings of their luxurious lakeside home.  Behind them was a motorboat and several armchairs.  In the snap, Cindy was dressed in a white, long-sleeved coverup with little white tassels around the bottom of the dress.  The star was makeup free with her brunette locks peeking out from under a white baseball cap.
